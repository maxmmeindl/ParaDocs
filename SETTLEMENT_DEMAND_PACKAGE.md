**Date**: [Current Date]
**To**: FEMA Office of Chief Counsel
**From**: Max J. Meindl III
**Re**: Settlement Demand - Disability Discrimination and Retaliation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This settlement demand is submitted in connection with EEOC Case No. HS-FEMA-02430-2024, involving egregious violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Rehabilitation Act by FEMA. The agency ignored my reasonable accommodation request for **1,340 days** before ultimately terminating me in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint.

**Total Settlement Demand: $2,272,902.25**

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

### The 1,340-Day Violation

On September 15, 2020, I submitted a formal request for reasonable accommodation due to my documented disability. This request was completely ignored—not denied, not discussed, simply ignored—for 1,340 consecutive days. During this period:

- I sent **26 follow-up emails** that went unanswered
- I escalated to multiple levels of management
- I documented the ongoing harm to my health and career
- The agency never initiated the mandatory interactive process

### Pattern of Retaliation

After filing my formal EEO complaint on February 20, 2024, I experienced immediate and severe retaliation:

- March 20, 2024: Sudden "performance concerns" raised (first time in my career)
- March 25, 2024: Written warning issued
- December 2024: Placed on Performance Improvement Plan
- January 6, 2025: Terminated while case pending

The temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse actions establishes clear retaliation.

3. Public litigation will commence
4. Media outreach will begin
5. Congressional notification will occur

## CONCLUSION

The facts of this case are undisputed: FEMA ignored my accommodation request for 1,340 days, then terminated me for complaining about it. No jury would find this acceptable. No judge would condone this conduct. 

Settlement now serves both parties' interests. The agency can correct its mistakes, implement necessary changes, and avoid a public trial that would damage its reputation and set terrible precedent.

I remain willing to discuss resolution but will not accept anything less than full compensation for the extraordinary harm caused by FEMA's deliberate indifference to federal disability law.

## AUTHORIZATION

This demand is made with full understanding of my rights and remedies. I authorize my representatives to negotiate within these parameters while reserving the right to proceed to trial if reasonable settlement cannot be achieved.
