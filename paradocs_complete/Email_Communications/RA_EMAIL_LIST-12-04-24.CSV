Shelia,

Thank you kindly for reaching out.

I submitted my request in the DHS Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS) and I did upload the 256-0-1 along with the medical documentation.

I reached out to HR for the “Position Description”.  I’m not sure where to find the “official” position description.

Tomorrow is good for a meeting.

Subject: RA Meeting Request

 

Good afternoon Mr. Meindl: 

   

On January 2, 2024, you submitted a request for a Reasonable Accommodation that is pending action. Per the RA instruction, FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy <https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_reasonable-accommodation-policy.pdf>  the timeframe for processing an accommodation is 45 days. The Disability Support Branch regrets the unavoidable delay, but is now prepared to service your request. To proceed we’d like to schedule an initial 15-30 minute meeting to review your request; after which we will contact and confirm that your Supervisor of Record (SOR) has awareness of your request for an accommodation. After an initial meeting with each, our office will arrange a joint interactive session to discuss accommodation options.   

  

Please provide a copy of your Position Description (PD) prior to the initial meeting; you may obtain a copy from your SOR or HR Specialist. If you have not already done so, please complete page one of the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation.  <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> Additionally, we encourage you to review the attached  FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing an accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

   

During the initial meeting we will also review the following:  

1.	the RA process;  
2.	roles and responsibilities;   
3.	timelines;   
4.	interactive process/discussion;  
5.	medical documentation;  
6.	definition of effective accommodation; and,  
7.	review your position description.  
	.  

Please confirm if you are available for an initial 15-30 minute meeting on July 11, 2024, anytime between 2:00 -3:30 pm EST any time on Friday, July 12th after 11L00 am. EST.  If these dates do not work for you, please let me know a convenient time to discuss your RA request..   

  

For tracking purposes, you must respond to this email using the same subject line.  

   

Thank you for your patience and contact us with any questions.    

  

Respectfully, Shelia Clemons

If you have not already done so, please complete page one of the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation.  <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> Additionally, we encourage you to review the attached  FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing an accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

   

During the initial meeting we will also review the following:  

1.	the RA process;  
2.	roles and responsibilities;   
3.	timelines;   
4.	interactive process/discussion;  
5.	medical documentation;  
6.	definition of effective accommodation; and,  
7.	review your position description.  
	.  

Please confirm if you are available for an initial 15-30 minute meeting on July 11, 2024, anytime between 2:00 -3:30 pm EST any time on Friday, July 12th after 11L00 am. EST.  If these dates do not work for you, please let me know a convenient time to discuss your RA request..

Good afternoon Mr. Meindl: 

   

On January 2, 2024, you submitted a request for a Reasonable Accommodation that is pending action. Per the RA instruction, FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy <https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_reasonable-accommodation-policy.pdf>  the timeframe for processing an accommodation is 45 days. The Disability Support Branch regrets the unavoidable delay, but is now prepared to service your request. To proceed we’d like to schedule an initial 15-30 minute meeting to review your request; after which we will contact and confirm that your Supervisor of Record (SOR) has awareness of your request for an accommodation.

It has been quite a chore getting an appointment to see the doc for the paperwork.

I’m scheduled for Monday next week but I’m guessing I might not have the paperwork by the 26th, I’ll try but not sure.

I may require an extension of time, I’ll know better Monday afternoon.

Subject: Medical Documentation Request

 

Mr. Meindl:

I was a pleasure talking with you a few minutes ago.  As indicated, the one medical statement currently on file is insufficient to substantiate your RA request.  The letter fails to meet the criteria outlined below:    

  

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:  

1.      Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual's condition;  

2.      The activity or activities that the condition limits;  

3.      The extent to which the condition limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; and,  

4.      Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation, is needed.  

  

If you have not done so already, we encourage you to discuss your accommodation(s) you are requesting, and the list of criteria for sufficient medical documentation with your medical provider. Submit additional medical documentation as a password protected or encrypted document using the same email thread and subject line.  Passwords may be shared in a separate email, with the same email subject line for tracking purposes. All correspondence must be on the office letterhead of a licensed healthcare provider, dated, and signed (wet signature preferred). If needed, your medical provider may fill out the attached “medical request form” and sign it rather than writing a letter with the required items. 

  

The requested information is due to our office within 14 calendar days (July 26, 2024).    Please contact me if you have any questions.

   

Thanks,

Mr. Meindl:

I was a pleasure talking with you a few minutes ago.  As indicated, the one medical statement currently on file is insufficient to substantiate your RA request.  The letter fails to meet the criteria outlined below:    

  

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:  

1.      Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual's condition;  

2.      The activity or activities that the condition limits;  

3.      The extent to which the condition limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; and,  

4.      Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation, is needed.  

  

If you have not done so already, we encourage you to discuss your accommodation(s) you are requesting, and the list of criteria for sufficient medical documentation with your medical provider. Submit additional medical documentation as a password protected or encrypted document using the same email thread and subject line.  Passwords may be shared in a separate email, with the same email subject line for tracking purposes. All correspondence must be on the office letterhead of a licensed healthcare provider, dated, and signed (wet signature preferred). If needed, your medical provider may fill out the attached “medical request form” and sign it rather than writing a letter with the required items.

"Medical Documentation Request","Max:

After our discussion, I went back to look at the initial medical documentation that is in the file.  That medical documentation dated in December 2023, indicated that you have several chronic illnesses.  The medical documentation that you submitted dated July 23, 2024, speaks to your need to care for your wife and nothing about your illnesses.  As we spoke, I indicated that the RA process is for the individual and not to care for your wife.  Since there is the medical statement that you have chronic illnesses, I am asking that you again provide medical documentation to support your specific need for a reasonable accommodation that is not related to the care of your wife.   The medical documentation contained in your file and submitted to me by you is not sufficient to support your RA request.  I am therefore requesting any new medical documentation be received no later than August 2, 2024 and must meet the following:

 

1.      Describes the nature, severity, and duration of your medical impairment; 

2.      The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;  

3.      The extent to which the impairment limits your ability to perform said activity or activities; and

4.      Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed to perform essential functions of the job. 

 

Should you have any problems with this request, please reach out to me.

Respectfully,

Subject: Medical Documentation Request

 

Max:

After our discussion, I went back to look at the initial medical documentation that is in the file.  That medical documentation dated in December 2023, indicated that you have several chronic illnesses.  The medical documentation that you submitted dated July 23, 2024, speaks to your need to care for your wife and nothing about your illnesses.  As we spoke, I indicated that the RA process is for the individual and not to care for your wife.  Since there is the medical statement that you have chronic illnesses, I am asking that you again provide medical documentation to support your specific need for a reasonable accommodation that is not related to the care of your wife.   The medical documentation contained in your file and submitted to me by you is not sufficient to support your RA request.  I am therefore requesting any new medical documentation be received no later than August 2, 2024 and must meet the following:

 

1.       Describes the nature, severity, and duration of your medical impairment; 

2.       The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;  

3.       The extent to which the impairment limits your ability to perform said activity or activities; and

4.       Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed to perform essential functions of the job. 

 

Should you have any problems with this request, please reach out to me.

Respectfully,

Subject: Medical Documentation Request

 

Max:

After our discussion, I went back to look at the initial medical documentation that is in the file.  That medical documentation dated in December 2023, indicated that you have several chronic illnesses.  The medical documentation that you submitted dated July 23, 2024, speaks to your need to care for your wife and nothing about your illnesses.  As we spoke, I indicated that the RA process is for the individual and not to care for your wife.  Since there is the medical statement that you have chronic illnesses, I am asking that you again provide medical documentation to support your specific need for a reasonable accommodation that is not related to the care of your wife.   The medical documentation contained in your file and submitted to me by you is not sufficient to support your RA request.  I am therefore requesting any new medical documentation be received no later than August 2, 2024 and must meet the following:

 

1.       Describes the nature, severity, and duration of your medical impairment; 

2.       The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;  

3.       The extent to which the impairment limits your ability to perform said activity or activities; and

4.       Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed to perform essential functions of the job. 

 

Should you have any problems with this request, please reach out to me.

Respectfully,

Yes it does appear to be two options; however, I have been advised to use the language in my email.  I do believe that the Disability Employment Program Manager in the Office of Equal Rights will work with your second level supervisor in addressing any appeal.

One or the other or both?

Good Afternoon – 

 

I have been tasked with verifying accountability for all staff scheduled to be in office on their designated days for the Houston office. I understand there is a pending Reasonable Accommodation request for Max. Below is an outline of the steps necessary to determine next action items for Max in the process re: his selected days in office for the Houston campus, as advised through discussion with Mission Support. 

 

*	When did employee initiate the Reasonable Accommodation request? Determine how long he has been out of the office. 

 

*	Identify employee’s RA specialist (person tasked with his RA request since beginning process) and reach out to them about the pending request. If specific person cannot be located then email stated inquiries to the Reasonable Accommodations mailbox. 

 

*	Inquire where in the process the request is. What items, documents, or other necessary items are necessary to complete the process for request to be satisfied.  

 

*	Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%? If so, was it a 90 day approval? Dates needed to show when approval was recorded. (Depending on length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable accommodation request might not be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

 

I am attempting to answer some of Max’s questions on next steps he needs to take and identify how the request can be settled through the proper guidelines we were given. If further clarification is needed please reach out to Karina Aguilo from Mission Support to advise.  

 

Thank you,

Subject: RE: Max Meindl Reasonable Accommodation Request

 

Max, this afternoon, I had a pleasant and productive MS Teams visit with Tim Wick and Andrew O’Donovan.

 

We recommend you contact Ms. Karina Aguilo, Mission Support Deputy Division Director, karina.aguilo.fema.dhs.gov, 940.232.8781.

 

As I understand, Ms. Aguilo has offered to assist you with your Reasonable Accommodation Request.

 

Regards,

Subject: Max Meindl Reasonable Accommodation Request

 

Good Afternoon – 

 

I have been tasked with verifying accountability for all staff scheduled to be in office on their designated days for the Houston office. I understand there is a pending Reasonable Accommodation request for Max. Below is an outline of the steps necessary to determine next action items for Max in the process re: his selected days in office for the Houston campus, as advised through discussion with Mission Support. 

 

*	When did employee initiate the Reasonable Accommodation request? Determine how long he has been out of the office. 

 

*	Identify employee’s RA specialist (person tasked with his RA request since beginning process) and reach out to them about the pending request. If specific person cannot be located then email stated inquiries to the Reasonable Accommodations mailbox. 

 

*	Inquire where in the process the request is. What items, documents, or other necessary items are necessary to complete the process for request to be satisfied.  

 

*	Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%? If so, was it a 90 day approval? Dates needed to show when approval was recorded. (Depending on length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable accommodation request might not be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

 

I am attempting to answer some of Max’s questions on next steps he needs to take and identify how the request can be settled through the proper guidelines we were given. If further clarification is needed please reach out to Karina Aguilo from Mission Support to advise.  

 

Thank you,

Miriam,

Thank you so much for you outreach and communications.

It has not been a common experience for me.

 

So if I’m understanding correctly, my first line supervisor can approve a temporary RA?

Would that be my permanent duty supervisor or my deployed duty super, or either one?

 

RE:

A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

 

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

 

Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

 

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

The decision is listed at the bottom of form 112.

 

Should you wish to Appeal the decision you can go through the appeal process as described in the attached manual.  See below for more information….

 

1-1.       The Appeal Process

A CORE who wishes to appeal a reprimand, suspension, or removal decision may do so in writing to his or her second level supervisor no later than 5:00 p.m. (the local time of the second level supervisor) on the fifth calendar day following the effective date of the disciplinary action. COREs included within collective bargaining units must follow the procedures for that unit. Oral appeals are not permitted. This appeal process is not applicable to non-disciplinary actions, such as right-sizing, demobilization, or the expiration of appointments.

A.   The CORE may provide a narrative and any documentation that he or she considers relevant for the second level supervisor to consider prior to issuing his or her final decision.

B.   The second level supervisor may gather additional documents that he or she deems necessary to make a final decision. The second level supervisor should complete any additional investigation within five working days of the receipt of a timely appeal and issue a decision within five working days after finishing an investigation.

C.   The Employee Relations Specialist will review the written decision drafted by the second level supervisor prior to its issuance to the CORE. Additionally, the Employee Relations Specialist will gather and preserve any and all additional documents acquired by the second level supervisor to issue the final decision and the final decision itself.

	Miriam,

	Thank you so much for you outreach and communications.

	It has not been a common experience for me.

	 

	So if I’m understanding correctly, my first line supervisor can approve a temporary RA?

	Would that be my permanent duty supervisor or my deployed duty super, or either one?

	 

	RE:

	A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

	 

	 

	 

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

	Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84ZR7EgOqg$> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

	 

	Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER*20Forms/Request*20Reasonable*20Accommodation*20Form*20256-0-1.pdf__;JSUlJSU!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84a6Zj18Og$> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=*2Fsites*2FOAI*2Fooer*2FDocuments*2FLaws*2C*20Authorities*2C*20Statements*2FRA*20Policies*2FReasonable*20Accommodation*20Process*20During*20Deployment*5FFact*20Sheet*5F508v*2Epdf&parent=*2Fsites*2FOAI*2Fooer*2FDocuments*2FLaws*2C*20Authorities*2C*20Statements*2FRA*20Policies__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJQ!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84ZwUWS8xQ$>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

	 

	I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

	“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=*2Fsites*2FMSFOW*2FWorkplacePolicyandForms*2FRemote*20Work&viewid=5e80857f*2D6001*2D4c4a*2Dad58*2Dc7d8ac04e446__;JSUlJSUlJSUl!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84a9cJlyjQ$> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

	 

	If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

	 

	If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

	 

	NEXT STEPS:

	 

	To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

	 

	Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

	1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
	2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
	3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
	4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
	5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
	6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

	 

	The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

	Miriam,

	Thank you so much for you outreach and communications.

	It has not been a common experience for me.

	 

	So if I’m understanding correctly, my first line supervisor can approve a temporary RA?

	Would that be my permanent duty supervisor or my deployed duty super, or either one?

	 

	RE:

	A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

	 

	 

	 

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

	Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx__;!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84ZR7EgOqg$> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

	 

	Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER*20Forms/Request*20Reasonable*20Accommodation*20Form*20256-0-1.pdf__;JSUlJSU!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84a6Zj18Og$> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=*2Fsites*2FOAI*2Fooer*2FDocuments*2FLaws*2C*20Authorities*2C*20Statements*2FRA*20Policies*2FReasonable*20Accommodation*20Process*20During*20Deployment*5FFact*20Sheet*5F508v*2Epdf&parent=*2Fsites*2FOAI*2Fooer*2FDocuments*2FLaws*2C*20Authorities*2C*20Statements*2FRA*20Policies__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJQ!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84ZwUWS8xQ$>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

	 

	I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

	“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=*2Fsites*2FMSFOW*2FWorkplacePolicyandForms*2FRemote*20Work&viewid=5e80857f*2D6001*2D4c4a*2Dad58*2Dc7d8ac04e446__;JSUlJSUlJSUl!!BClRuOV5cvtbuNI!CkuZ83eyrm4zAkPDvO6wR-Z--yYHk1bTnSwy0W_6Mh4FT1j0KVjEqNtBisRtbIEeFbAIPSXu4X1MyubU84a9cJlyjQ$> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

	 

	If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

	 

	If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

	 

	NEXT STEPS:

	 

	To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

	 

	Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

	1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
	2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
	3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
	4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
	5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
	6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

	 

	The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

Good afternoon Max:

 

You should simply send an email to Hunter indicating that you are appealing the decision issued by your supervisor, Anthony In. There is no specific format needed.  If you have no additional documents, simply state why you believe that In’s denial should be changed.  Please copy me on any communication.  Then Hunter must respond within the 10 day time period that the regulations require.

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

Please email your Second Line Supervisor of Record to let them know you wish to appeal the decision and provide your reasons for the appeal. After notifying them, you and your supervisor will need to have an interactive discussion (via Teams) to review the requested accommodation and ensure that you are provided an accommodation that is effective for both you and the agency. Our records indicate that you 08/06/2022 request was closed by RA Specialist 09/05/2022, due to unresponsiveness.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Alejandro,

As to your last sentence, I don’t recall being nonresponsive to any inquiries.

This RAR was the first time I was contacted, proactively, for any RAR.

I do recall an email or 2 requesting additional info which was provided.

A conversation?  Never happened.

Then there is the fact of the entire deletion of “closed” RAR records, including medical docs.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

It's difficult to determine what happened a few years ago since the RA Specialist is no longer with the agency. However, I can assure you that your current case is being reviewed with hopes that your SOR will provide you with an effective accommodation.

Alejandro,

As to your last sentence, I don’t recall being nonresponsive to any inquiries.

This RAR was the first time I was contacted, proactively, for any RAR.

I do recall an email or 2 requesting additional info which was provided.

A conversation?  Never happened.

Then there is the fact of the entire deletion of “closed” RAR records, including medical docs.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Please email your Second Line Supervisor of Record to let them know you wish to appeal the decision and provide your reasons for the appeal. After notifying them, you and your supervisor will need to have an interactive discussion (via Teams) to review the requested accommodation and ensure that you are provided an accommodation that is effective for both you and the agency. Our records indicate that you 08/06/2022 request was closed by RA Specialist 09/05/2022, due to unresponsiveness.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max – 

 

It's difficult to determine what happened a few years ago since the RA Specialist is no longer with the agency. However, I can assure you that your current case is being reviewed with hopes that your SOR will provide you with an effective accommodation.

 

Thanks,

Alejandro,

As to your last sentence, I don’t recall being nonresponsive to any inquiries.

This RAR was the first time I was contacted, proactively, for any RAR.

I do recall an email or 2 requesting additional info which was provided.

A conversation?  Never happened.

Then there is the fact of the entire deletion of “closed” RAR records, including medical docs.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

Please email your Second Line Supervisor of Record to let them know you wish to appeal the decision and provide your reasons for the appeal. After notifying them, you and your supervisor will need to have an interactive discussion (via Teams) to review the requested accommodation and ensure that you are provided an accommodation that is effective for both you and the agency. Our records indicate that you 08/06/2022 request was closed by RA Specialist 09/05/2022, due to unresponsiveness.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

If you are a federal employee or applicant for a federal job, the law protects you from discrimination because of your race, color, sex, national origin, age, religion, disability and genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.)

There are also federal laws, regulations and Executive Orders that do not permit discrimination on other bases, such as sexual orientation, marital status, status as a parent or political affiliation. 

If you are a federal employee or applicant for a federal job and you believe that a federal agency has discriminated against you, you have the right to file a complaint. The first step is to contact an EEO Counselor by calling the office responsible for that agency's EEO complaints program. Each agency is required to post information about how to contact the agency's EEO Office. If you do not see such a posting, contact the Human Resources Office for that agency.

Generally, you must contact the EEO Counselor within 45 days from the day the discrimination occurred.

Contact information for the EEO of your agency may be found on our web page, https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/federal-agency-eeo-directors <https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/federal-agency-eeo-directors>  .

Alternatively, you may call us at 1-800-669-4000 (VideoPhone: 1-844-234-5122) to discuss your situation. 

Sincerely,

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

My RA has been denied.
How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

RE: From policy
Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation?
FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee's limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.


Thank you for your assistance.

"RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort","Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Good morning – 

I have received your Request for Reasonable Accommodation of last Resort (RAOLR). To commence the process, it is crucial that you provide the following documents:

1.	Appendix A - Please read and complete Appendix A carefully, as these will be the parameters under which our team will search for a reassignment position.
2.	Updated Resume An updated resume is essential to ensure you are considered for positions that match your qualifications.

Please find attached Appendix A: Reassignment Search Parameters. Below some clarifying points on frequently asked questions of Appendix A:  

	*	Question 1: Will you accept a position within your current Component that requires you to relocate to another geographic area, at your own expense?
		Clarification: This question is asking if you are willing to move to a new location for a job within the same division of your current department, and you would be responsible for any relocation costs.
	*	Question 2: Will you accept a position located in another geographic location?
		Clarification: If you answer ""Yes,"" please list the specific geographic areas (cities, states, or regions) where you would be willing to relocate for a new position.
	*	Question 4: Will you accept a non-equivalent position (e.g., lower grade, less promotion potential, etc.) within your current local commuting area?
		Clarification: This question is asking if you are open to taking a job that may have a lower pay grade or fewer opportunities for promotion but is still within your current commuting distance. If you answer ""No,"" proceed to question 5.
	*	Lower Graded Position: If you are willing to accept a lower graded position, specify the lowest grade you would consider.
		Clarification: Indicate the minimum job level you would accept if a position with a lower grade is offered.
	*	Different Pay System: Will you accept a position in a different pay system (e.g., GS, FWS, FG/SV Pay Banding)?
		Clarification: This is asking if you are open to working under a different pay structure than your current one. The General Schedule (GS), Federal Wage System (FWS), and Pay Banding (FG/SV) are examples of different pay structures within the government.
	*	Question 7: Please list any position, including Component, which you believe to be vacant and for which you would like to be considered for reassignment:
		Clarification: If you are aware of any specific job openings within the department that you are interested in, list them here.

1.	Submit the Completed Appendix A and Updated Resume Return the completed Appendix A and your updated resume within five (5) calendar days of receiving this email. You can submit these documents via email to aglae.telladogarcia@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:aglae.telladogarcia@fema.dhs.gov>

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Good morning – 

I have received your Request for Reasonable Accommodation of last Resort (RAOLR). To commence the process, it is crucial that you provide the following documents:

1.	Appendix A - Please read and complete Appendix A carefully, as these will be the parameters under which our team will search for a reassignment position.
2.	Updated Resume An updated resume is essential to ensure you are considered for positions that match your qualifications.

Please find attached Appendix A: Reassignment Search Parameters. Below some clarifying points on frequently asked questions of Appendix A:  

	*	Question 1: Will you accept a position within your current Component that requires you to relocate to another geographic area, at your own expense?
		Clarification: This question is asking if you are willing to move to a new location for a job within the same division of your current department, and you would be responsible for any relocation costs.
	*	Question 2: Will you accept a position located in another geographic location?
		Clarification: If you answer ""Yes,"" please list the specific geographic areas (cities, states, or regions) where you would be willing to relocate for a new position.
	*	Question 4: Will you accept a non-equivalent position (e.g., lower grade, less promotion potential, etc.) within your current local commuting area?
		Clarification: This question is asking if you are open to taking a job that may have a lower pay grade or fewer opportunities for promotion but is still within your current commuting distance. If you answer ""No,"" proceed to question 5.
	*	Lower Graded Position: If you are willing to accept a lower graded position, specify the lowest grade you would consider.
		Clarification: Indicate the minimum job level you would accept if a position with a lower grade is offered.
	*	Different Pay System: Will you accept a position in a different pay system (e.g., GS, FWS, FG/SV Pay Banding)?
		Clarification: This is asking if you are open to working under a different pay structure than your current one. The General Schedule (GS), Federal Wage System (FWS), and Pay Banding (FG/SV) are examples of different pay structures within the government.
	*	Question 7: Please list any position, including Component, which you believe to be vacant and for which you would like to be considered for reassignment:
		Clarification: If you are aware of any specific job openings within the department that you are interested in, list them here.

1.	Submit the Completed Appendix A and Updated Resume Return the completed Appendix A and your updated resume within five (5) calendar days of receiving this email. You can submit these documents via email to aglae.telladogarcia@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:aglae.telladogarcia@fema.dhs.gov>

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

"RE: Meindl, Max: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort","Tara, 

Per our conversations last week, where you acknowledged the receipt of the informal complaint and implied that someone would be contacting me.  

Well, to date, you have been the only one to reach out to speak with me and now we seem to be back at square one.

Is this a duplicate request?

We are in receipt of your Intake form.  

I have assigned Janet Kelley (cc’d) as your EEO Counselor to assist with processing your complaint. 

She will contact you shortly to schedule an initial interview, and moving forward she will assist you with processing your complaint. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Ms. Janet Kelley.

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Tara, 

Per our conversations last week, where you acknowledged the receipt of the informal complaint and implied that someone would be contacting me.  

Well, to date, you have been the only one to reach out to speak with me and now we seem to be back at square one.

Is this a duplicate request?

RE: 09/03/24 from FEMA-OCR-EEO FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov> 

We are in receipt of your Intake form.  

I have assigned Janet Kelley (cc’d) as your EEO Counselor to assist with processing your complaint. 

She will contact you shortly to schedule an initial interview, and moving forward she will assist you with processing your complaint. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Ms. Janet Kelley.       

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Tara, 

Per our conversations last week, where you acknowledged the receipt of the informal complaint and implied that someone would be contacting me.  

Well, to date, you have been the only one to reach out to speak with me and now we seem to be back at square one.

Is this a duplicate request?

I have assigned Janet Kelley (cc’d) as your EEO Counselor to assist with processing your complaint. 

She will contact you shortly to schedule an initial interview, and moving forward she will assist you with processing your complaint. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Ms. Janet Kelley.       

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

•             Wednesday, 18, 2024-

               9:00am – 10:00am (EST)

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

•             Wednesday, 18, 2024-

               9:00am – 10:00am (EST)

               10:00am –11:00 am (EST)

              11:00 am EST-12:00 pm (EST)

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

•             Wednesday, 18, 2024-

               9:00am – 10:00am (EST)

               10:00am –11:00 am (EST)

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.

ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

"RE: EEO Contact -HS-FEMA-03389-2024","***This Reasonable accommodation request (RAR), filed on 01/02/2024.  

A response was initiated, after I requested assistance from leadership, on 07/10/2024.  

That is 190 days after filing the request.  Previously filed RAR’s are represented below.  137 days should be added to each of the dates below.  

The remaining RAR, those not deleted along with the medical records, have been open as follows: 

RAR0046767 has been open for 190 days before any action, 

RAR0042452 has been open for 707 days, 

RAR0023278 has been open for 985 days and 

RAR0023261 has been open an astonishing 986 days.

 

*** Good morning, Max, After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form. If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.  Respectfully,  Anna Myers, EEO Specialist, Reasonable Accommodation (RA).

 

***My reply.

Anna, 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  

Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.

21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

i. I would prefer to reach an acceptable accommodation in my current position if I can continue to support the mission.

ii. I am of the opinion that it would be imprudent to agree to a “Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort” which would imply a really good and proper RA process with robust interactive discussion, exploring options, short term or long term options, etc.

iii. That did not happen.

iv. It was just pretty much if I can’t physically deploy, we can’t use you.

v. I don’t want to upset the apple cart here, I am just saying that I have successfully done this very job, virtually, since 09/2021.

vi. It’s not that I can’t do the job, the problem is the disability, apparently.  

vii. The finality of the “Last Resort”, that just doesn’t seem right because I’m of the opinion this was a very rushed process with little dialog, option exploring, etc.

8. Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.

1. After careful consideration, Mr. Max Meindl’s request to telework 100% of the time is denied.  

2. The approval to allow Mr. Meindl to telework 100% of the time would require that the Agency remove the essential function of deployment from his duties and responsibilities.

iv. Primarily due to declining health

v. A proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

vi. I have been,

1. virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023) 

a. 38 months (not including this year), 48 months taking into account the past 10 months of little to no work to do.

2. physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.

5. Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

5. however, his acknowledgment that he cannot leave his house to deploy under any circumstances contributes to my decision.  

a. Respondent comments

i. I’m not sure of the source of the information for stipulating “he cannot leave his house to deploy under any circumstances”.

ii. I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

iii. It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

iv. There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a bit problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

v. The “cannot leave my house” statement is a bit dramatic.  

vi. Yes, I don’t get out much except for essentials and my daughter drives me.

6. Finally, his branch (Infrastructure Branch, Recovery Division) supports disaster deployments on an almost daily basis.  

7. His temporary accommodation cannot continue as assignments of duties are totally unrelated to his current position of record and cannot be continued.

a. Respondent comments

i. Agreed but I am curious why, when asked by my SOR if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

ii. I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

iii. I was virtually deployed to 4611DR, (09/2021-04/2023) as a PDTFL.

iv. I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

v. One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic.

Anthony In, denial

1. Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  

2. It is understood that Mr. Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is close to his home; however, I cannot consider that in a decision to grant the request.  

3. The option presented by Mr. Meindl is not a viable solution as I cannot grant him the ability to limit his deployment location.  

4. Given that Mr. Meindl would need to be sent wherever the disaster is located and his inabilities to do would limit my ability, therefore, I must deny his request.

a. Respondent comments

a. I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

b. When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

d. From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

e. Why?

f. I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

g. If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

h. I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

i. I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-04/2023) as a PDTFL.

j. I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

•             Wednesday, 18, 2024-

               9:00am – 10:00am (EST)

              11:00 am EST-12:00 pm (EST)

•             

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information? 

Please choose one of the current available dates:

•             Wednesday, 18, 2024-

               9:00am – 10:00am (EST)

               10:00am –11:00 am (EST)

              11:00 am EST-12:00 pm (EST)

•             

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.

I will have Mr. In correct that as I did not notice that.  I your second medical was more appropriate; however, given your position, the Agency could not allow the 100% telework.  As discussed, you were needed to go to any location where there was a disaster.

Miriam,

Thank you so much for you outreach and communications.

It has not been a common experience for me.

 

So if I’m understanding correctly, my first line supervisor can approve a temporary RA?

Would that be my permanent duty supervisor or my deployed duty super, or either one?

 

RE:

A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

 

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

 

Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

 

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation?
FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee's limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

MEMORANDUM FOR:     All FEMA Employees

 

FROM:                                   Deanne Criswell

                                        Administrator

SUBJECT:                            Equal Employment Opportunity Reaffirmation Statement

	
		
 


I am proud to join U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas in reaffirming FEMA’s commitment to equal employment opportunity (EEO) and civil rights in our workforce.

 

Federal laws, regulations, and executive orders protect FEMA employees and applicants against employment discrimination. Every FEMA employee and applicant must be treated fairly in all aspects of employment in accordance with merit system principles and the law.

 

I believe  our diverse workforce is our greatest asset. We strive to build and sustain an inclusive, professional work environment at FEMA that reflects our strategic goal of instilling equity as a foundation of emergency management, and our core values of compassion, fairness, integrity and respect. To realize those core values, every FEMA employee has the freedom to compete on a fair and level playing field. Additionally, managers must ensure equal employment opportunities and fairness in the implementation of policies, practices, procedures, and conditions. 

 

I support the ability of all employees to exercise their rights under our federal civil rights statutes.

Discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status), age, disability, protected genetic information (including family medical history), parental status, or reprisal is against the law. Workplace harassment will not be tolerated. FEMA will take immediate corrective action against harassing conduct to prevent it from becoming pervasive. FEMA will investigate allegations of harassing conduct and take corrective or disciplinary action as appropriate. Additionally, reprisal against anyone who engages in protected activity will not be tolerated. This includes reporting discrimination or harassment, participating in the EEO process, whistleblowing, or using an appeals or grievance process. 

 

Managers lead our EEO efforts and are expected to fully comply with the law by making employment decisions – including those affecting recruitment/hiring, merit promotion, deployment, transfer, reassignments, training and career development, benefits, mentoring, awards, and separation – in the interest of the public good and in accordance with EEO laws, merit system principles, and the Stafford Act. Managers will participate in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to resolve workplace or EEO disputes absent extraordinary circumstances as determined by the Office of Civil Rights Director.  

 

Managers, supervisors, or employees with questions about conflict prevention, management, or resolution options should contact the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Division at 202-646-2835 or FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov> . Managers or employees interested in ADR options for resolving an EEO complaint should contact Carletta McDowell (ADR Program Manager) via e-mail at Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov>  or telephone at 771-444-0976.

 

Consistent with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employees and applicants with disabilities have a right to request a reasonable accommodation. To request a reasonable accommodation, send the request to FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov> . Additionally, pursuant to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), employees may request reasonable accommodations for conditions related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy. To request a pregnancy-related accommodation, please contact: FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov> .

 

Employees who believe they are being, or have been, subjected to unlawful discrimination or a hostile work environment (including harassment) based on, or as a result of, discrimination have the right to initiate an EEO complaint by contacting the Office of Civil Rights at FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov>  or 202-212-3535. For the complaint to be timely, employees must contact the FEMA Office of Civil Rights within 45 days of the alleged date of the discrimination or within 45 days of the date they reasonably suspect discrimination.

 

I expect everyone at FEMA to uphold a culture of respect, professionalism and inclusiveness in our workforce. As we carry out our mission  we all have a responsibility to ensure our actions and behaviors demonstrate our commitment to equal employment opportunity and civil rights consistent with the law.

 

Sincerely,

Deanne

"2024 National Disability Employment Awareness Month","Dear FEMA Team,

 

Please join us in celebrating National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) as we recognize the significant contributions of people with disabilities within FEMA and our nation. Throughout October, we honor the achievements of people with disabilities whose talents and dedication enrich our workplaces and communities every day. 

 

The 2024 theme, “Access to Good Jobs for All <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/initiatives/ndeam> ,” emphasizes the importance of ensuring that everyone, including people with disabilities, has equal access to meaningful employment opportunities. It reminds us that an inclusive workplace is not only a fair one, but also one that benefits from the perspectives and strengths of all employees.

 

The history of disability rights in the United States is one of perseverance, advocacy, and progress. From the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 to the ongoing efforts for greater accessibility and inclusion, the journey continues. The stories of those who have championed disability rights remind us that the road to inclusion is paved with bold vision, determination and courage.

 

We celebrate leaders like Judy Heumann, a lifelong disability rights activist, whose tireless work helped shape policies and create opportunities for millions of people with disabilities. We also reflect on the legacy of Justin Dart, often called the “Father of the ADA,” whose advocacy was instrumental in the passage of this landmark legislation. Finally, At FEMA, we acknowledge the achievements of our many employees who voluntarily identify as persons with disabilities, like Dr. Sherman Gillums Jr. Dr. Gillums, who uses a wheelchair, is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and director of FEMA’s Office of Disability Integration and Coordination <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/News/SitePages/History-of-FEMA-Programs--Office-of-Disability-Integration-and-Coordination.aspx> . These pioneers, and many others, have shown us that accessibility is not just a legal requirement, but it is also a moral imperative.

 

As FEMA employees, we are part of this ongoing journey. Our commitment to accessibility and inclusion strengthens our mission and ensures that we truly reflect the communities we serve.

 

The Disability ALLY Employee Resource Group (D-FERG) <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/teams/OCCHCOHCI/DIEE/IDC/FERG/SitePages/Disability.aspx/teams/OCCHCOHCI/DIEE/IDC/FERG/SitePages/Disability.aspx> , supported by the Office of Civil Rights, will host events in October to celebrate NDEAM and promote awareness of disability employment issues. These planned events include a mentoring opportunity and a panel discussion with Gallaudet University. Please check the “Upcoming Events” section of the D-FERG <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/teams/OCCHCOHCI/DIEE/IDC/FERG/SitePages/Disability.aspx>  SharePoint page in the upcoming days for dates, times, and virtual access information about these events. The FERG Events Calendar <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/teams/OCCHCOHCI/DIEE/IDC/FERG/SitePages/FERGs.aspx>  will also have links to participate in virtual events. 

 

We hope these events inspire you to learn more about the vital role that people with disabilities play in our agency and beyond. Let’s work together to ensure that FEMA remains a place where all employees have access to good jobs, and where they can thrive and contribute to our mission.

 

These events are fully accessible to people with disabilities. If you would like to request a reasonable accommodation, contact the Office of Civil Rights at FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov>  as soon as possible.  Last-minute requests will be accepted but may not be possible to fulfill.

Good afternoon, 

 

Thank you for contacting the EEO Branch via email on 8/22/2024.  Employees, former employees, and applicants who believe they have been discriminated against or subjected to harassment because of a protected category must consult with and initiate an informal EEO complaint with an EEO counselor.  Employees, former employees, and applicants must contact an EEO counselor within 45 calendar days of the matter believed to be discriminatory, or in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of that action. 

 

I have attached some additional information pertaining to the EEO process and other resources available.  If you would like to contact the FEMA Office of Civil Rights to file an EEO Complaint, you may do so by phone at 202-212-3535 or by returning the attached intake form via email to FEMA-OCR-EEO@FEMA.DHS.GOV.

 

Respectfully,

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Another form to sign?

Subject: RE: RAR0046767

 

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

Good morning, Max – 

 

It's difficult to determine what happened a few years ago since the RA Specialist is no longer with the agency. However, I can assure you that your current case is being reviewed with hopes that your SOR will provide you with an effective accommodation.

 

Thanks,

Alejandro,

As to your last sentence, I don’t recall being nonresponsive to any inquiries.

This RAR was the first time I was contacted, proactively, for any RAR.

I do recall an email or 2 requesting additional info which was provided.

A conversation?  Never happened.

Then there is the fact of the entire deletion of “closed” RAR records, including medical docs.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

Please email your Second Line Supervisor of Record to let them know you wish to appeal the decision and provide your reasons for the appeal. After notifying them, you and your supervisor will need to have an interactive discussion (via Teams) to review the requested accommodation and ensure that you are provided an accommodation that is effective for both you and the agency. Our records indicate that you 08/06/2022 request was closed by RA Specialist 09/05/2022, due to unresponsiveness.

Is there a specific format or form, as typical for FEMA, for the appeal to the second level supervisor.

I don’t have anything to add to the file currently (additional information).

Do I leave a voice mail, send an email, MS Teams chat?

Are there any required words/verbiage that are required.

 

This has been a long, frustrating, and lonely process and I appreciate your providing some clarification for me.

I just know all the attention to detail required on my part, (real signatures) and then to receive that “denial” that wasn’t even signed, in my opinion, just add to the confusion.

Is this a real process or a part time endeavor the is very much impacting my life.

The process took 190 days to start after I requested leadership assistance for an expedited review.

(Other RAR have been open for 707 days and 985 and 986 days with no comms.)

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, Max – 

 

We apologize for the way it’s written in our policy and understand that it may be a bit confusing. The Director of the Office of Civil Rights, and our embedded OCC attorney don’t look at denials until it’s time for your supervisor to issue a final agency denial letter. The 256-0-2 Management Decision from your 1st line and 2nd line are sort of an “intent to deny”. This is because a request isn’t denied by the agency until we’ve exhausted all efforts, to include reassignment as an accommodation of last resort. If you’ve been denied your request for reasonable accommodation, you may appeal directly to your second level supervisor within ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of the decision. During this appeal, you may present additional information in support of your request. The second level supervisor will respond to your request within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. If your 2nd line supervisor also denies the request, you may seek reassignment as an accommodation of last resort in which the agency will attempt to reassign you to a vacant position for which you may be qualified for based on numerous factors (e.g., parameters, experience, etc).

 

If reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is unsuccessful, the agency would have exhausted all efforts in accommodating your need and your leadership will draft a Final Agency Denial Letter for OCR Leadership & OCC review.

 

Let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

 

Thanks,

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Ms. Kelley: 

I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

Thank you, 
Brent Smith

My RA has been denied.

How do I validate/verify the required OER/OCC participation/review?

 

1.	From FEMA RA policy 04/2024:

“If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your response in writing via Appendix D: Management Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director with a copy. 

The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship.

• Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response to the employee. 

For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

2.	RE: From policy

Prior to denying a request for reasonable accommodation for an applicant or employee, the Deciding Official and the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) must consult with the OCC embedded attorney in OCR to articulate the specific reasons for the denial. The Deciding Official in coordination with the RA Specialist (assigned to the employee request) will draft the denial decision. The OCR Director must review and concur with all denial decisions within 3 business days of the denial decision

 

3.	From fact sheet.

How is a decision reached regarding a request for a reasonable accommodation? 

FEMA is required to initiate an interactive discussion with individuals who request an accommodation. It is through this discussion that the SOR learns about the employee’s limitations and types of accommodations which would be the most effective to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his/her job. The SOR may consult with OER, if assistance is needed. The final decision rests with the SOR; however, a SOR may not issue a denial without the concurrence of OER. Once decided, the SOR must meet with the employee to discuss the decision and provide them the decision in writing. Once issued, a copy of the decision must be forwarded to OER.

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

 

Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions and concerns.

 

Kindest regards,

Ms. Kelley: 

 

I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

 

It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

 

I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

 

Thank you, 

Brent Smith

	Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

	 

	Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

	Ms. Kelley: 

	 

	I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

	 

	It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

	 

	I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

	 

	Thank you, 

	Brent Smith

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		 

		Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

MEMORANDUM FOR:     All FEMA Employees

 

FROM:                                   Deanne Criswell

                                        Administrator

SUBJECT:                            Equal Employment Opportunity Reaffirmation Statement

	
		
 


I am proud to join U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas in reaffirming FEMA’s commitment to equal employment opportunity (EEO) and civil rights in our workforce.

 

Federal laws, regulations, and executive orders protect FEMA employees and applicants against employment discrimination. Every FEMA employee and applicant must be treated fairly in all aspects of employment in accordance with merit system principles and the law.

 

I believe  our diverse workforce is our greatest asset. We strive to build and sustain an inclusive, professional work environment at FEMA that reflects our strategic goal of instilling equity as a foundation of emergency management, and our core values of compassion, fairness, integrity and respect. To realize those core values, every FEMA employee has the freedom to compete on a fair and level playing field. Additionally, managers must ensure equal employment opportunities and fairness in the implementation of policies, practices, procedures, and conditions. 

 

I support the ability of all employees to exercise their rights under our federal civil rights statutes.

Discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status), age, disability, protected genetic information (including family medical history), parental status, or reprisal is against the law. Workplace harassment will not be tolerated. FEMA will take immediate corrective action against harassing conduct to prevent it from becoming pervasive. FEMA will investigate allegations of harassing conduct and take corrective or disciplinary action as appropriate. Additionally, reprisal against anyone who engages in protected activity will not be tolerated. This includes reporting discrimination or harassment, participating in the EEO process, whistleblowing, or using an appeals or grievance process. 

 

Managers lead our EEO efforts and are expected to fully comply with the law by making employment decisions – including those affecting recruitment/hiring, merit promotion, deployment, transfer, reassignments, training and career development, benefits, mentoring, awards, and separation – in the interest of the public good and in accordance with EEO laws, merit system principles, and the Stafford Act. Managers will participate in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to resolve workplace or EEO disputes absent extraordinary circumstances as determined by the Office of Civil Rights Director.  

 

Managers, supervisors, or employees with questions about conflict prevention, management, or resolution options should contact the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Division at 202-646-2835 or FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov> . Managers or employees interested in ADR options for resolving an EEO complaint should contact Carletta McDowell (ADR Program Manager) via e-mail at Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov>  or telephone at 771-444-0976.

 

Consistent with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employees and applicants with disabilities have a right to request a reasonable accommodation. To request a reasonable accommodation, send the request to FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov> . Additionally, pursuant to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), employees may request reasonable accommodations for conditions related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy. To request a pregnancy-related accommodation, please contact: FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov> .

 

Employees who believe they are being, or have been, subjected to unlawful discrimination or a hostile work environment (including harassment) based on, or as a result of, discrimination have the right to initiate an EEO complaint by contacting the Office of Civil Rights at FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov>  or 202-212-3535. For the complaint to be timely, employees must contact the FEMA Office of Civil Rights within 45 days of the alleged date of the discrimination or within 45 days of the date they reasonably suspect discrimination.

 

I expect everyone at FEMA to uphold a culture of respect, professionalism and inclusiveness in our workforce. As we carry out our mission  we all have a responsibility to ensure our actions and behaviors demonstrate our commitment to equal employment opportunity and civil rights consistent with the law.

 

Sincerely,

Deanne

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		 

		Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		 

		Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

Is there a new agreement? The one attached already has my signature from the 15th. Do I need to print this out and sign it? Or will there be an updated version with a new digital signature? Or a blank document to signed?  

OLr are you talking about the Request to Extend EEO Counseling? I thought my signature was not needed on that document.


I am unclear what is needed from me. Please advise.

Thank you,

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

	Brent,

	Should we find out how the meeting will be conducted, first? 

	I.E. MS Teams, Zoom, or in person.

	I can’t do in person, not driving much anymore.

	What’s a good time for you?

	I’m very flexible.

	 

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

			Ms. Kelley: 

			 

			I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

			 

			It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

			 

			I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

			 

			Thank you, 

			Brent Smith

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		 

		Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

		Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

		 

		Thank you for email.  For clarification, your client expressed his intent to file an EEO complaint when he returned his intake form on Sep 3, 2024.  And that is the correct date that should be in the extension letter. Again, I apologize for the confusion.

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

	Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

	 

	Good morning, Max,

	 

	After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

	 

	If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

	 

	If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

	 

	Respectfully,

	Anna Myers

	Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

	 

	Anna,

	 

	I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

	I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

	*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

	I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

	If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

	When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

	The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

	Hence, here we are.

	This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

	This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

	So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

	This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

	Ignored, abused, dismissed.

	Is this really the purpose of the program?

	 

	This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

	The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  

	

	Respondent comments

	1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

	2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

	3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

	4.            Primarily due to declining health

	5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

	6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

	7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

	8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

	9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

	10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

	11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

	12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

	13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

	14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

	15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

	16.         Why?

	17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

	18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

	19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

	20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.

	

	21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

	22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

	 

	                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

	The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

	Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

	Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

	Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

	Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

	Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

	 

	.

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

"RE: Request Information","My current SOR is Anthony In.  

During conversations with Tony about my concerns, he said it was not his decision(s), they were coming from above him.  

He even told me he was told to stand down on this issue when I inquired for clarification over why, after we agreed, I would deploy to Houston, he called me back and said he was overruled.  

I can’t specify the source of the direction/guidance being given to Tony and as such I didn’t identify a source of the discrimination in the intake form.  

To me it appeared like a group effort, although I have no real idea.  

This is a snip of my current origination chart in MS Teams.

At the time, since 12/2024, Jodi hunter was Tony’s SOR and she was the second level super who also denied the RAR.

	Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

	 

	Anna,

	 

	I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

	I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

	*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

	I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

	If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

	When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

	The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

	Hence, here we are.

	This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

	This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

	So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

	This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

	Ignored, abused, dismissed.

	Is this really the purpose of the program?

	 

	This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

	The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  

	

	Respondent comments

	1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

	2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

	3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

	4.            Primarily due to declining health

	5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

	6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

	7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

	8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

	9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

	10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

	11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

	12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

	13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

	14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

	15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

	16.         Why?

	17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

	18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

	19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

	20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.

	

	21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

	22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

	 

	                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

	The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

	Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

	Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

	Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

	Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

	Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

	 

	.

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

	Good morning, Max,

	 

	After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

	 

	If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

	 

	If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

	 

	Respectfully,

Max: 

I wanted to create a different thread for our communications to avoid confusion and any chance of confidential information being shared inadvertently by either of us.

My proposed response:

""Mr. Meindl's SOR during the time subject to his complaint and current SOR is Anthony In. Mr. Meindl's discussions with Mr. In resulted initially in acceptable and agreeable solutions regarding Mr. Meindl's placement/work duties and opportunities to contribute through deployment on a virtual basis. 


Mr. In communicated to Mr. Meindl that he had been overruled. No information regarding the individual or individuals above Mr. In that overruled the solutions worked out between Mr. In and Mr. Meindl. 


There did not appear to be any direct actions taken by Mr. In, but his name is the only one that can be given as any contact with an individual that can be named. Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In. Because none of the communications regarding those decisions above Mr. In are known, Mr. Meindl cannot specifically name any one individual or multiple individuals.


If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.""

"RE: Information Requested","SOR, supervisor of record.

 

Mr. Meindl's SOR during the time subject to his complaint and current SOR is Anthony In. 

Mr. Meindl's discussions with Mr. In resulted initially in acceptable and agreeable solutions regarding Mr. Meindl's placement/work duties and opportunities to contribute through a proposed physical deployment to Houston or continue work on a virtual basis. 

Mr. In communicated to Mr. Meindl that he had been overruled. 

No information regarding the individual or individuals above Mr. In that overruled the solutions worked out between Mr. In and Mr. Meindl. 

There did not appear to be any direct actions taken by Mr. In, but his name is the only one that can be given as any contact with an individual that can be named. 

Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In. 

Because none of the communications regarding those decisions above Mr. In are known, Mr. Meindl cannot specifically name any one individual or multiple individuals.

If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you. I agree. But based on his communication to you, you have no reason to treat those statements as lies at this point. If those above him throw him under the bus or it turns out it was him and he lied, then that will be on those above you and him potentially to either point that out or prove who was the actual individual that caused the harm.  

I think the best thing we can do for now is to communicate what we know to be true, and they can point fingers at each other regarding who is ultimately responsible. At the end of the day, what we want is for them to resolve the situation satisfactorily. 

Thanks,
Brent

Thank you. I agree. But based on his communication to you, you have no reason to treat those statements as lies at this point. If those above him throw him under the bus or it turns out it was him and he lied, then that will be on those above you and him potentially to either point that out or prove who was the actual individual that caused the harm.  

 

I think the best thing we can do for now is to communicate what we know to be true, and they can point fingers at each other regarding who is ultimately responsible. At the end of the day, what we want is for them to resolve the situation satisfactorily. 

 

Thanks,

Brent

	Thank you. I agree. But based on his communication to you, you have no reason to treat those statements as lies at this point. If those above him throw him under the bus or it turns out it was him and he lied, then that will be on those above you and him potentially to either point that out or prove who was the actual individual that caused the harm.  

	 

	I think the best thing we can do for now is to communicate what we know to be true, and they can point fingers at each other regarding who is ultimately responsible. At the end of the day, what we want is for them to resolve the situation satisfactorily. 

	 

	Thanks,

	Brent

			Max: 

			 

			I wanted to create a different thread for our communications to avoid confusion and any chance of confidential information being shared inadvertently by either of us.

			 

			My proposed response:

			 

			""Mr. Meindl's SOR during the time subject to his complaint and current SOR is Anthony In. Mr. Meindl's discussions with Mr. In resulted initially in acceptable and agreeable solutions regarding Mr. Meindl's placement/work duties and opportunities to contribute through deployment on a virtual basis. 

			 

			Mr. In communicated to Mr. Meindl that he had been overruled. No information regarding the individual or individuals above Mr. In that overruled the solutions worked out between Mr. In and Mr. Meindl. 

			 

			There did not appear to be any direct actions taken by Mr. In, but his name is the only one that can be given as any contact with an individual that can be named. Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In.

			If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.""

			 

			What does the abbreviation SOR mean? Let me know what you think of this and any changes you would like to make or think may be advisable to edit. I would like to be accurate, keep a tone that is not accusatory of Mr. In at this point. But also not waive any options by the very nature of being unable to name those above him with any specificity.

				Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In. 

				Because none of the communications regarding those decisions above Mr. In are known, Mr. Meindl cannot specifically name any one individual or multiple individuals.

				If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.

				 

				Thank you for your assistance.

				I wanted to create a different thread for our communications to avoid confusion and any chance of confidential information being shared inadvertently by either of us.

				 

				My proposed response:

				 

				""Mr. Meindl's SOR during the time subject to his complaint and current SOR is Anthony In. Mr. Meindl's discussions with Mr. In resulted initially in acceptable and agreeable solutions regarding Mr. Meindl's placement/work duties and opportunities to contribute through deployment on a virtual basis. 

				 

				Mr. In communicated to Mr. Meindl that he had been overruled. No information regarding the individual or individuals above Mr. In that overruled the solutions worked out between Mr. In and Mr. Meindl. 

				 

				There did not appear to be any direct actions taken by Mr. In, but his name is the only one that can be given as any contact with an individual that can be named. Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In. Because none of the communications regarding those decisions above Mr. In are known, Mr. Meindl cannot specifically name any one individual or multiple individuals.

				 

				If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.""

				 

				What does the abbreviation SOR mean? Let me know what you think of this and any changes you would like to make or think may be advisable to edit. I would like to be accurate, keep a tone that is not accusatory of Mr. In at this point. But also not waive any options by the very nature of being unable to name those above him with any specificity. 

				 

				Thank you,

		Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

		 

		Anna,

		 

		I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

		I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

		*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

		I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

		If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

		When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

		The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

		Hence, here we are.

		This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

		This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

		So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

		This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

		Ignored, abused, dismissed.

		Is this really the purpose of the program?

		 

		This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

		The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  

		

		Respondent comments

		1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

		2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

		3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

		4.            Primarily due to declining health

		5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

		6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

		7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

		8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

		9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

		10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

		11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

		12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

		13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

		14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

		15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

		16.         Why?

		17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

		18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

		19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

		20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.

		

		21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

		22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

		 

		                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

		The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

		Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

		Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

		Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

		Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

		Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

		Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

		 

		Good morning, Max,

		 

		After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

		 

		If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

		 

		If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

		 

		Respectfully,

		Anna Myers

Ms. Kelley: 

 

Mr. Meindl's Supervisor of Record (SOR) during the time subject to his complaint and current SOR is Anthony In. Mr. Meindl's discussions with Mr. In resulted initially in acceptable and agreeable solutions regarding Mr. Meindl's placement/work duties and opportunities to contribute through a proposed physical deployment to Houston or continue to work on a virtual basis.

 

Mr. In communicated to Mr. Meindl that he had been overruled. No information regarding the individual or individuals above Mr. In that overruled the solutions worked out between Mr. In and Mr. Meindl. 

 

There did not appear to be any direct actions taken by Mr. In, but his name is the only one that can be given as any contact with an individual that can be named. Mr. Meindl at this point would only be able to make his complaint about the individuals above Mr. In that would have made the decision to overrule Mr. In. Because none of the communications regarding those decisions above Mr. In are known, Mr. Meindl cannot specifically name any one individual or multiple individuals.

 

If specific names are needed to complete the formal complaint, then Mr. Meindl would necessarily need to include all individuals above Mr. In that are in his organizational reporting chain of command that were involved in the decision to overrule Mr. In.

 

Thank you,

Brent

		Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

		 

		Anna,

		 

		I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

		I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

		*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

		I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

		If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

		When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

		The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

		Hence, here we are.

		This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

		This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

		So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

		This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

		Ignored, abused, dismissed.

		Is this really the purpose of the program?

		 

		This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

		The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  

		

		Respondent comments

		1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

		2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

		3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

		4.            Primarily due to declining health

		5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

		6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

		7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

		8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

		9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

		10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

		11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

		12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

		13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

		14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

		15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

		16.         Why?

		17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

		18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

		19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

		20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.

		

		21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

		22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

		 

		                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

		The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

		Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

		Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

		Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

		Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

		Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

		 

		.

		 

		Thank you for your assistance.

		Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

		 

		Good morning, Max,

		 

		After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

		 

		If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

		 

		If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

		 

		Respectfully,

		Anna Myers

		Ms. Kelley: 

		 

		I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

		 

		It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

		 

		I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

		 

		Thank you, 

		Brent Smith

			Good afternoon Mr. Smith,

			Ms. Kelley: 

			 

			I spoke with my client, and I need to understand where the date of October 3, 2024 comes from. Without further information and clarification of why that is the date that should be used I cannot advise my client to sign the document. My client would like to have this process resolved expeditiously and conveniently for all parties involved. 

			 

			It is my understanding that the incidents and causes for my client's complaint have been ongoing and occurring essentially continuously since near the beginning of the year. My client informed me and provided the communications regarding the timing of his complaint and the submission of forms. It appears to me that the form was submitted on September 3, 2024 and acknowledged on September 13, 2024. 

			 

			I cannot advise my client to sign a form with a date that is inaccurate, and could potentially invalidate claims and worse be used as a document against him signing something that is inaccurate. I understand there are timing issues involved in this process and deadlines that must be met. But I cannot advise him to sign without further clarification on the October 3, 2024 date.

			 

			Thank you, 

			Brent Smith

Max: 

It seems like they might be trying to set you up for not working. Are you able to spend your day bugging people for tasks and assignments? If you spend 8 hours a day trying to find work at least it puts the failure on them. But I am honestly at a loss as to what to advise. 

It seems like for them to require you to justify what you do for 8 hours each day cannot be held against you when they refuse to provide sufficient work. Especially when work exists, they just want to stand on their weird ""determination"" that remote work is not allowed even though it is a perfectly acceptable accommodation.

Max: 

From the beginning I have believed they are just simply wrong that they cannot accommodate you in this manner simply by saying deployment is an essential function that cannot be accommodated by telework. It looks like they are really going to just push this and force you to file a lawsuit or give up. I am not sure what to advise on how to handle it. 

You have 45 days to address this with EEO. It might be worth looking for and discussing with an EEO specialty attorney. I can try and talk with the attorneys I know to see if they know of anyone or work on those types of cases. Especially if we can find one willing to take it on contingency. 

Also what does this mean for the reset on the mediation Wednesday, December 4th?

Regards,
Brent

"RE: FW: RAR0046767 Final Agency Denial Letter","IMO, the RA request, and the current ADR are separate tracks and Tony may or may not be aware of it.

The letter sounds/reads as if it was written by an attorney though, just saying.

And… we are in the middle of the EEO process right now, the ADR we are having meetings about.

The meeting is still a go and, unless I bring it up, not sure of anyone in the call, except me and you, would be aware of the letter, but I’m not sure of that at all.

The letter may have been written by the lawyer attending the meetings.

I think at this point we should attend the meeting. I recommend we not bring it up or discuss it unless they do. I agree that an attorney wrote the letter. There is certainly language designed to argue that because you cannot perform the essential function of deploying that is the grounds for the denial.  

It is my argument though that it is an essential function that can be accommodated. Further, they have accommodated for years, and in a way by only requiring 4 in office attendance days per pay period they essentially make the in office requirement less than the ability to work via telework anyway. That in and of itself tells me that they can accommodate, it is a reasonable accommodation, but they are refusing to recognize that. I believe I know the reason as we discussed, but unfortunately that will be very difficult to prove. But I believe that it is in bad faith, and again unfortunately will likely require a lawsuit to get the relief I believe you are entitled to and not exactly a great option to pursue.

	From the beginning I have believed they are just simply wrong that they cannot accommodate you in this manner simply by saying deployment is an essential function that cannot be accommodated by telework.

	You have 45 days to address this with EEO. It might be worth looking for and discussing with an EEO specialty attorney. I can try and talk with the attorneys I know to see if they know of anyone or work on those types of cases. Especially if we can find one willing to take it on contingency. 

	 

	Also what does this mean for the reset on the mediation Wednesday, December 4th?

Max: 

I went back and looked at the Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and found this. Which is different than my initial understanding of essential function accommodation. The relevant passage is below:


There are several modifications or adjustments that are not considered forms of reasonable accommodation. An employer does not have to eliminate an essential function, i.e., a fundamental duty of the position. This is because a person with a disability who is unable to perform the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, is not a ""qualified"" individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Nor is an employer required to lower production standards -- whether qualitative or quantitative -- that are applied uniformly to employees with and without disabilities. However, an employer may have toprovide reasonable accommodation to enable an employee with a disability tomeet the production standard. While an employer is not required to eliminate an essential function or lower a production standard, it may do so if it wishes.


The problem I have is that they have accommodated this for years, and even the fact that they require in office less than 40% of the time. It seems to me they could if they chose to accommodate around this essential function. Maybe a reasonable accommodation is some level of in office that is less than what is required but you do occasionally work in office. I am just not sure how much they are willing to work with you. I also realize that this mediation is not exactly for the accommodations portions, but I do not see why they cannot eliminate the issue by finding a compromise.

Regards,
Brent
