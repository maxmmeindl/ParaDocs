## FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION

### I. INTRODUCTION AND EXTRAORDINARY VIOLATIONS

1. **This case presents one of the most serious violations of federal disability law in government history: FEMA ignored Complainant's reasonable accommodation request for 1,340 days (3.7 years)** - a delay that exceeds the statutory 45-day requirement by 2,878% and demonstrates not merely negligence, but deliberate indifference to the rights of employees with disabilities.

2. This extraordinary 1,340-day violation is not an isolated incident but rather the most egregious example of FEMA's systemic failure to comply with federal disability laws. As revealed by FEMA's FOIA response dated May 2, 2025 (2025-FEFO-01396), the Agency claims it maintains "no responsive records" for reasonable accommodation approval/denial rates by age group spanning 2017-2025, despite clear federal mandates requiring such tracking under FEMA Manual 1430.1, Manual 123-6-1, and Instruction 256-022-01.

3. The complete absence of legally-mandated tracking data for over seven years, combined with the pattern of serious delays affecting Complainant (RAR0023278: 1,275 days; RAR0023261: 1,205 days; RAR0042452: 995 days), reveals a deliberate indifference that resulted in Complainant's constructive discharge and subsequent retaliatory termination.

### II. CONTINUING VIOLATION DOCTRINE

4. Complainant invokes the continuing violation doctrine as the discriminatory conduct alleged herein constitutes an ongoing pattern and practice that continued through his termination:

   a. **Pattern of RA Delays:** The pattern began with RAR001234 (196-day delay) in 2018 and continued through multiple requests, each experiencing increasingly serious delays.

   b. **Systemic Policy Violations:** FEMA's admitted failure to track RA data as required by federal law constitutes a continuing violation that affected every RA request processed (or ignored) by the Agency.

   c. **Hostile Work Environment:** The cumulative effect of these ongoing violations created a continuing hostile work environment for Complainant.

   d. **Retaliatory Termination:** The ultimate act of retaliation occurred just 17 days after filing the formal EEO complaint.

5. Under National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), hostile work environment claims are not time-barred if at least one act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period. Here, multiple acts occurred within the filing period, including:
   - The 1,340-day violation (ongoing through May 2024)
   - Hurricane Beryl welfare check failure (July 2024)
   - RAR0046767 denial (August 2024)
   - Retaliatory termination (January 6, 2025)

### III. SYSTEMIC FAILURE AND PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATION

6. **Complete Breakdown of RA Tracking Systems:** FEMA's FOIA response admission that it maintains no RA tracking data despite legal mandates demonstrates:

   a. **Violation of FEMA Manual 1430.1 (8-1):** Requires tracking number, type, approval/denial, reasons, and processing time via Form 14-13A, retained for 3+ years.

   b. **Violation of Manual 123-6-1 (7-1):** Mandates annual RA reporting via Form 256-0-2, retained for employee tenure.

   c. **Violation of Instruction 256-022-01 (p. 24):** Requires Form 256-0-2 submission within 10 days of decisions.

   d. **Violation of Rehabilitation Act ยง501:** Failure to maintain data prevents required affirmative action monitoring.

7. **Pattern Affecting Complainant:** The systemic nature is evidenced by:
   - 47 FEMA officials involved in violations against Complainant
   - Complete absence of tracking data revealing organizational indifference
   - Multiple RA requests abandoned without resolution
   - No evidence of any interactive process conducted

### IV. CAUSES OF ACTION

**COUNT I: REHABILITATION ACT - FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE**
- 1,340-day delay violates 29 U.S.C. ยง791 and 29 C.F.R. ยง1630.2(o)
- Multiple continuing violations through unresolved requests
- Systemic failure to engage in interactive process

**COUNT II: REHABILITATION ACT - DISPARATE TREATMENT**
- Termination for disability-related absences
- Pattern of denying accommodations
- Discriminatory treatment based on disability

**COUNT III: RETALIATION**
- Termination 17 days after EEO filing
- Temporal proximity establishes causation
- Prior protected activity ignored

**COUNT IV: HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT**
- Cumulative effect of ongoing violations
- Severe and pervasive conduct
- Management participation/acquiescence

**COUNT V: AGE DISCRIMINATION**
- Disparate impact on older worker with disabilities
- FOIA response prevents statistical proof
- Inference from missing data and treatment

**COUNT VI: PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS**
- Termination without required procedures
- No 30-day notice under 5 CFR 752
- No opportunity to respond

### V. RELIEF SOUGHT

8. **Compensatory Damages:**
   - Back pay from termination date: $525,000
   - Lost benefits and retirement contributions: $175,000
   - Future economic losses: $350,000
   - Hurricane damage from welfare check failure: $15,000
   - Emotional distress and suffering: $1,205,000
   - **Total Compensatory Damages: $2,270,000**

9. **Punitive Damages:**
   - For willful and malicious violations
   - To deter future discriminatory conduct
   - Amount to be determined at hearing

10. **Injunctive Relief:**
    - Declaration that FEMA's policies violate federal law
    - Order requiring FEMA to implement compliant RA tracking systems
    - Mandatory training for all Region 6 managers on disability law
    - Annual reporting to EEOC on RA processing metrics

11. **Other Relief:**
    - Attorneys' fees and costs
    - Pre- and post-judgment interest
    - Any other relief deemed just and proper

### VI. EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

12. The 1,340-day delay alone warrants summary judgment on liability, as no reasonable factfinder could conclude such serious delay complies with federal law. This violation is so severe it constitutes:
    - **Per se discrimination** under controlling precedent
    - **Willful violation** supporting punitive damages
    - **Continuing violation** extending statutory deadlines

13. FEMA's FOIA response admitting no tracking data exists constitutes an admission against interest that:
    - Establishes systemic liability
    - Prevents FEMA from disproving disparate impact
    - Supports adverse inference instruction
    - Demonstrates willful indifference to legal obligations

### VII. DEMAND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING

Complainant demands a full evidentiary hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge on all claims alleged herein, recognizing that the 1,340-day violation creates virtually likely liability requiring only determination of appropriate damages.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this ___ day of _______, 2025.
