Good afternoon, 

 

I have reviewed your emails, which consisted of the same DHS COVID Vaccine Medical Exemption Form (not admissible) and screenshots from your Employee Personal Page (EPP). Once again, there is still no medical documentation to substantiate an RA for disability. 

 

If your SOR is willing to consider granting situational telework under the standard provisions of the telework policy, an RA for disability is not required. Please let me know if you and your SOR choose to pursue a standard telework agreement, so that we can close out this RA ticket in a timely manner.

 

If your SOR will only consider granting situational telework to qualified employees with disabilities as a reasonable accommodation, please be sure to submit both your amended FF-256 and supporting medical documentation to me by August 11th. As stated in prior emails, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain ALL of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

Respectfully,

Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

 

Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

 

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

Well, both docs delineate my heart/cardio condition and life conditions it hinders.

I am sticking with the RA process for now.

 

RE:

A person with a disability is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.

 

Policy lists 5 criteria for medical information and you list 6.

Why the variance?

 

It will take a few days to get an appointment with my doctor to get the letter.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon, 

 

I have reviewed your emails, which consisted of the same DHS COVID Vaccine Medical Exemption Form (not admissible) and screenshots from your Employee Personal Page (EPP). Once again, there is still no medical documentation to substantiate an RA for disability. 

 

If your SOR is willing to consider granting situational telework under the standard provisions of the telework policy, an RA for disability is not required. Please let me know if you and your SOR choose to pursue a standard telework agreement, so that we can close out this RA ticket in a timely manner.

 

If your SOR will only consider granting situational telework to qualified employees with disabilities as a reasonable accommodation, please be sure to submit both your amended FF-256 and supporting medical documentation to me by August 11th. As stated in prior emails, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain ALL of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

Respectfully,

Miriam Aybar-Morales

Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/SitePages/Reasonable-Accommodation-(RA).aspx> .  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

 

Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

 

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

Miriam,

Thank you so much for you outreach and communications.

It has not been a common experience for me.

 

So if I’m understanding correctly, my first line supervisor can approve a temporary RA?

Would that be my permanent duty supervisor or my deployed duty super, or either one?

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the  Remote Work Manual <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446> . Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

 

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

 

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year. 

 

NEXT STEPS:

 

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th, along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

 

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

 

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

Re: RAR0042452 for Telework: 100%,"
Jeez Maz!!  What a nightmare.  It’s clear they are doing their very best to discriminate without wholly violating the law. I would say they are by asking these questions, though it may just be easier to get a single form to meet their concerns.  I work extensively with Dr. Bill Lionberger who has such a form he produces now - seemingly in response to similar attacks on peoples’ rights.   Can you get ahold of Bill and share those requirements with him?   His email is: 

Aspireinhealth@gmail.com (Dr. Bill Lionberger).


I appreciate the kind words and No to worry with Maria, she’s a good soul and fighting hard for her Aussie people who are way worse off than us in the US - they truly do live in a penal colony and their police are all mercenaries now.  There is even compulsory psychotropic drug use for any reason the govt deems fit.  This is what happens when a government is trusted without question.  

What’s happening in ours?  I keep hearing of two war fronts being built.  These idiots are going to war in Taiwan and Ukraine at the same time it seems.  Surely our govt doesn’t want elections fo they will absolutely lose power to finish their job on us all.

God bless Max,
Todd

	Todd,
	Hoping you are doing well.
	We were watching you on Rumble with maryz or something like that, but had to quit after a bit because she spent so much time speaking over you.  I don't understand why these hosts have guests only to spout their opinions instead of letting their guests speak and afterall, I was watching to see what you had to say...not her... oh well
	anyway..
	I'm, once again, applying for a reasonable accomodation to telework on days we're required to ""report to the office"". (2 days in office per 2 week pay period) in a high community level environment.
	
	This requirement does not apply to all FEMA employees, in fact my entire team doesn't have to do it, only me.  Go figure.
	Do you have a decent boilerplate type of reply to the following questions that the FEMA disability group requires for an RA application?
	They already have 3 RA requests that thouroughly document my disability, yet they continue to ask again and again, going so far as to say there is no disability on record to my supervisor.
	The specific questions are below:

	
	

	""If your SOR will only consider granting situational telework to qualified employees with disabilities as a reasonable accommodation, please be sure to submit both your amended FF-256 and supporting medical documentation to me by August 11th. 
	

	
	

	As stated in prior emails, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain ALL of the following information:

	 

	Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

	1.	Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
	2.	The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits; 
	3.	The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; 
	4.	Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
	5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
	6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

	 

	I would like to slam dunk these obstructionists so any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

	My supervisors has already signed off bu the RA/Disability group is pushing back as they always do.

	They don not want to allow any reasonable accomodations and who are they to question my disability anyway?

	What a shit show, really.
	

	

	 

	 

	Thank you for your assistance.

	Well, both docs delineate my heart/cardio condition and life conditions it hinders.

	I am sticking with the RA process for now.

	 

	RE:

	A person with a disability is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.

	 

	Policy lists 5 criteria for medical information and you list 6.

	Why the variance?

	 

	It will take a few days to get an appointment with my doctor to get the letter.

	Good afternoon, 

	 

	I have reviewed your emails, which consisted of the same DHS COVID Vaccine Medical Exemption Form (not admissible) and screenshots from your Employee Personal Page (EPP). Once again, there is still no medical documentation to substantiate an RA for disability. 

	 

	If your SOR is willing to consider granting situational telework under the standard provisions of the telework policy, an RA for disability is not required. Please let me know if you and your SOR choose to pursue a standard telework agreement, so that we can close out this RA ticket in a timely manner.

	 

	If your SOR will only consider granting situational telework to qualified employees with disabilities as a reasonable accommodation, please be sure to submit both your amended FF-256 and supporting medical documentation to me by August 11th. As stated in prior emails, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain ALL of the following information:

The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees on the RA process.

	 

	Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation <https://link.dradvocates.com/click/1oL0v-PuEsnoKJ.8DNe9k96ba7pk/nI-bs3ot/3s/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> , as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://link.dradvocates.com/click/1oL0v-PuEsnoKJ.8DNe9k96ba7pk/6Gx0zKcq/3s/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

	 

	I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.

	“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the <https://link.dradvocates.com/click/1oL0v-PuEsnoKJ.8DNe9k96ba7pk/L7GlG8IJ/3s/usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/MSFOW/WorkplacePolicyandForms/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FMSFOW%2FWorkplacePolicyandForms%2FRemote%20Work&viewid=5e80857f%2D6001%2D4c4a%2Dad58%2Dc7d8ac04e446>

Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar year. 

	 

	If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner. 

	 

	If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year.

	5.	Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as 
	6.	How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

	 

	The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.

OAST ACMS Notification


 

MAX MEINDL,

You are receiving this message because our records show that you requested an exemption from (or a temporary delay in) complying with the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, as established by Executive Orders (E.O.) 14043 and 14042.  Your request has been pending since a nationwide injunction went into effect prohibiting any implementation of the vaccine requirement.   On May 9, 2023, E.O. 14099 Moving Beyond COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements for Federal Workers, was issued, thereby revoking the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for Federal civilian employees and Federal contractors.  Consequently, all requirements to receive a COVID-19 vaccine are no longer in force.  Since DHS is no longer requiring that employees be vaccinated for COVID-19, DHS will be taking steps to administratively close all requests for a reasonable accommodation from the vaccine requirement by September 30, 2023, to ensure compliance with E.O. 14099. 

Since exemptions are no longer needed, you may voluntary withdraw your request by updating your reasonable accommodation request ticket in ACMS by clicking on “My Tickets <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast?id=dhs_requests> ”, then clicking on “Cancel.” If you wish to amend your existing exemption request to note an accommodation issue outside of the COVID-19 vaccine requirement from your original request, please notify DHS by sending an email to vaccine.exemption@hq.dhs.gov <mailto:vaccine.exemption@hq.dhs.gov> , with reference to your original ACMS ticket number on or before September 30, 2023. Absent an email by September 30, 2023, indicating your wish to have your existing or amended request processed for accommodations other than an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement, your exemption request will be administratively closed as of said date, without prejudice, to resubmit your accommodation request at a later date by creating a new request ticket in ACMS. 

 

Thank you for your cooperation and prompt attention to this matter. Please contact your Component’s Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager <https://dhsconnect.dhs.gov/org/offices/crcl/eeo/Pages/Reasonable-Accommodations-at-DHS.aspx>  with any questions.

Subject: RA Meeting Request 
 

Good afternoon Mr. Meindl: 

   

On January 2, 2024, you submitted a request for a Reasonable Accommodation that is pending action. Per the RA instruction, FEMA Reasonable Accommodation Policy <https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_reasonable-accommodation-policy.pdf>  the timeframe for processing an accommodation is 45 days. The Disability Support Branch regrets the unavoidable delay, but is now prepared to service your request. To proceed we’d like to schedule an initial 15-30 minute meeting to review your request; after which we will contact and confirm that your Supervisor of Record (SOR) has awareness of your request for an accommodation. After an initial meeting with each, our office will arrange a joint interactive session to discuss accommodation options.   

  

Please provide a copy of your Position Description (PD) prior to the initial meeting; you may obtain a copy from your SOR or HR Specialist. If you have not already done so, please complete page one of the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation.  <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/OER%20Forms/Request%20Reasonable%20Accommodation%20Form%20256-0-1.pdf> Additionally, we encourage you to review the attached  FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/OAI/ooer/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies%2FReasonable%20Accommodation%20Process%20During%20Deployment%5FFact%20Sheet%5F508v%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FOAI%2Fooer%2FDocuments%2FLaws%2C%20Authorities%2C%20Statements%2FRA%20Policies>  The fact sheet explains the RA process in a nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing an accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking and hearing.  

   

During the initial meeting we will also review the following:  

1.	the RA process;  
2.	roles and responsibilities;   
3.	timelines;   
4.	interactive process/discussion;  
5.	medical documentation;  
6.	definition of effective accommodation; and,  
7.	review your position description.  
	.  

Please confirm if you are available for an initial 15-30 minute meeting on July 11, 2024, anytime between 2:00 -3:30 pm EST any time on Friday, July 12th after 11L00 am. EST.  If these dates do not work for you, please let me know a convenient time to discuss your RA request..   

  

For tracking purposes, you must respond to this email using the same subject line.  

   

Thank you for your patience and contact us with any questions.    

  

Respectfully, Shelia Clemons

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort,"Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

 

.

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Tara, 

Per our conversations last week, where you acknowledged the receipt of the informal complaint and implied that someone would be contacting me.  

Well, to date, you have been the only one to reach out to speak with me and now we seem to be back at square one.

Is this a duplicate request?

RE: 09/03/24 from FEMA-OCR-EEO FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov> 

We are in receipt of your Intake form.  

I have assigned Janet Kelley (cc’d) as your EEO Counselor to assist with processing your complaint. 

She will contact you shortly to schedule an initial interview, and moving forward she will assist you with processing your complaint. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Ms. Janet Kelley.       

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Good morning, Max,

 

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%), management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in the attached 256-02 form.

 

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position, consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation.  Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to deploy.  

 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

 

Respectfully,

Anna Myers

Tara, 

Per our conversations last week, where you acknowledged the receipt of the informal complaint and implied that someone would be contacting me.  

Well, to date, you have been the only one to reach out to speak with me and now we seem to be back at square one.

Is this a duplicate request?
RE: “must consult with and initiate an informal EEO complaint with an EEO counselor” 09/03/24 from FEMA-OCR-EEO <FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov>

 

RE: 09/03/24 from FEMA-OCR-EEO FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov> 

We are in receipt of your Intake form.  

I have assigned Janet Kelley (cc’d) as your EEO Counselor to assist with processing your complaint. 

She will contact you shortly to schedule an initial interview, and moving forward she will assist you with processing your complaint. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Ms. Janet Kelley.       

 

 

Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: RE: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

 

Anna,

 

I do not believe that I am no longer able to perform the essential functions of the specified position.

I am limited in my ability to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues.

*This may impact the preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process.

I was blissfully unaware that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that information being provided during the interview.

If you can access the job interview transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement.

When told that information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.

The only “interactive process” I had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel.

Hence, here we are.

This specific RAR was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to expedited. 

This happened after being in the que for 190 days. 

So, I do appreciate the absurdity of the note to “reply no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years.  

This RAR sits for months and then gets turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, or at least that is how I currently feel.

Ignored, abused, dismissed.

Is this really the purpose of the program?

 

This snip was taken around 02/24/24, so add days as appropriate.

The RA requests, never get adjudicated.  



Respondent comments

1.            My understanding, at this time, is that the “essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.

2.            I can and do provide the essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and responsibilities.

3.            The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 

4.            Primarily due to declining health

5.            For the past few years, a proactive SOR and assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment.

6.            I have been virtually deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to assist practically anywhere)

7.            I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 05/2023-11/2023.  15 months

8.            In office guess (06/2018-03/2020).          21 months

9.            I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy.

10.         It does not impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020.

11.         There was a short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, which was a problematic with a medical event being tossed into the mix.

12.         I was under the assumption we were exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to Houston was had on 05/29/24.

13.         When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was overruled.

14.         In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the response was that he was told to stand down on this issue.

15.         From my perspective, my SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was overruled.

16.         Why?

17.         I would like to assume it was because of a concern over my health.

18.         If so, why not a virtual deployment option?

19.         I have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and how I could do more for the mission.

20.         I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-05/2023) as a PDTFL.



21.         I worked virtually from 03/2020-09/2021.

22.         One 6-month deployment since 03/2020, which was problematic

 

                Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.

The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, where applicable:

Why the requested accommodation would not be effective;

Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential job function; or

Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of a performance or production standard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Greetings,

I am an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), Internal Civil Rights Division (ICRD), Equal Employment Opportunity Branch (EEOB) and I have been assigned as the counselor for your informal EEO complaint. 

First, I would like to provide some information about the process and what to expect. The EEO process for a federal employee or job applicant, ensures your rights under federal civil rights laws that protect you from discrimination because of your race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The law also protects you from retaliation if you oppose employment discrimination, file a complaint of discrimination, or participate in the EEO complaint process (even if the complaint is not yours.) The OCR EEO office is neutral in the processing of all complaints, and we do not advocate for the complainant or the agency, we instead ensure the administrative process is executed according to the EEOC MD-110, 29 CFR 1614 and other federal laws as applicable.

When a decision is made in an EEO complaint the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) or the DHS- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) Final Agency Decision (FAD) writer will be looking at whether the complaint shows a connection or nexus between the actions taken in the complaint and the protected basis(es) claimed. The AJ or CRCL FAD writer will then look at whether management provided a non-discriminatory reason for taking that action. Please keep that in mind when providing information or supporting documentation for your complaint. The process looks at whether discrimination or harassment occurred because of a protected basis. The Agency has other avenues to address complaints that are not based on an EEO protected category, let us know if you need that information.

The first stage of the EEO process is informal counseling. We will have an initial interview where we will discuss: 1.) the EEO process, your role, and your rights and responsibilities, 2.) your complaint and the issues that you are bringing as part of your EEO complaint, and 3.) next steps in the EEO process.  In addition, I am providing some important information attached regarding the EEO process (see attached).   

The intake form was already completed with by you. If you have not done so already, please provide a timeline of events for the instances you wish to include in your EEO Complaint.  Be sure to include dates (mm/dd/yy) of when the alleged incidents in your complaint occurred. If you don’t have the exact date, please try to provide at least the month and year of when the alleged incident(s) occurred. Attached are several documents required to get the process started. 

Our records reflect your initial contact date with EEOB as July 25, 2024, when we received an e-mail/call from you on this date.  Since I only have 30 days from initial contact to counsel your case and to attempt an informal resolution in accordance with applicable EEO regulations, I have attached an extension request that extends the informal counseling period an additional 60 days to ensure we have sufficient time for informal counseling.  If you agree to the extension, please read, sign, and return that document as well.  Also attached is your Notice of Rights and Responsibilities in the EEO process. Please read and initial each line and sign and return. If you have any questions, we can discuss them when we meet.

During the informal EEO process, you have the right to elect traditional EEO counseling or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an option to resolve your complaint.  In traditional EEO counseling, the assigned EEO counselor serves as a go between and communicates your concerns and remedies requested to management and attempts to resolve the issue(s), as well as conducts a limited inquiry to collect additional information regarding your claims. ADR or mediation is an informal meeting between you and management that is conducted by a neutral mediator. The mediator is trained to help people who have disagreements talk to each other.  The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  During mediation you can voice your concerns and the mediator assists all parties in effectively communicating. The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or issue a decision.  Instead, the mediator helps the parties work out their own solutions to their dispute. 

 There are real advantages to participating in ADR.  ADR offers both you and the agency the opportunity for a fast and informal settlement of the dispute.  Rather than leaving the decision to a third party (such as an Administrative Judge), ADR gives you the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both you and the agency. During mediation all parties are together in one room or over Teams/Zoom. The process begins with the mediator explaining the procedure. Each party gets an opportunity to tell their side of the dispute. If a settlement is reached, a written agreement is drawn up, signed by all parties, and is binding by all parties. This process is voluntary and highly recommended in resolving workplace disputes at the lowest level.

Once I get all your information back, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss your concerns.  The EEO process is time sensitive so please return all your documents to me within 2 business days.  Also, could you please include your working hours and availability when you return your information?

MEMORANDUM FOR:     All FEMA Employees

 

FROM:                                   Deanne Criswell

                                        Administrator

SUBJECT:                            Equal Employment Opportunity Reaffirmation Statement

	
		 
 


I am proud to join U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas in reaffirming FEMA’s commitment to equal employment opportunity (EEO) and civil rights in our workforce.

 

Federal laws, regulations, and executive orders protect FEMA employees and applicants against employment discrimination. Every FEMA employee and applicant must be treated fairly in all aspects of employment in accordance with merit system principles and the law.

 

I believe  our diverse workforce is our greatest asset. We strive to build and sustain an inclusive, professional work environment at FEMA that reflects our strategic goal of instilling equity as a foundation of emergency management, and our core values of compassion, fairness, integrity and respect. To realize those core values, every FEMA employee has the freedom to compete on a fair and level playing field. Additionally, managers must ensure equal employment opportunities and fairness in the implementation of policies, practices, procedures, and conditions. 

 

I support the ability of all employees to exercise their rights under our federal civil rights statutes.

Discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status), age, disability, protected genetic information (including family medical history), parental status, or reprisal is against the law. Workplace harassment will not be tolerated. FEMA will take immediate corrective action against harassing conduct to prevent it from becoming pervasive. FEMA will investigate allegations of harassing conduct and take corrective or disciplinary action as appropriate. Additionally, reprisal against anyone who engages in protected activity will not be tolerated. This includes reporting discrimination or harassment, participating in the EEO process, whistleblowing, or using an appeals or grievance process. 

 

Managers lead our EEO efforts and are expected to fully comply with the law by making employment decisions – including those affecting recruitment/hiring, merit promotion, deployment, transfer, reassignments, training and career development, benefits, mentoring, awards, and separation – in the interest of the public good and in accordance with EEO laws, merit system principles, and the Stafford Act. Managers will participate in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to resolve workplace or EEO disputes absent extraordinary circumstances as determined by the Office of Civil Rights Director.  

 

Managers, supervisors, or employees with questions about conflict prevention, management, or resolution options should contact the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Division at 202-646-2835 or FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-ADR@fema.dhs.gov> . Managers or employees interested in ADR options for resolving an EEO complaint should contact Carletta McDowell (ADR Program Manager) via e-mail at Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:Carletta.McDowell@fema.dhs.gov>  or telephone at 771-444-0976.

 

Consistent with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employees and applicants with disabilities have a right to request a reasonable accommodation. To request a reasonable accommodation, send the request to FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-RA@fema.dhs.gov> . Additionally, pursuant to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), employees may request reasonable accommodations for conditions related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy. To request a pregnancy-related accommodation, please contact: FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-PWFA@fema.dhs.gov> .

 

Employees who believe they are being, or have been, subjected to unlawful discrimination or a hostile work environment (including harassment) based on, or as a result of, discrimination have the right to initiate an EEO complaint by contacting the Office of Civil Rights at FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov>  or 202-212-3535. For the complaint to be timely, employees must contact the FEMA Office of Civil Rights within 45 days of the alleged date of the discrimination or within 45 days of the date they reasonably suspect discrimination.

 

I expect everyone at FEMA to uphold a culture of respect, professionalism and inclusiveness in our workforce. As we carry out our mission  we all have a responsibility to ensure our actions and behaviors demonstrate our commitment to equal employment opportunity and civil rights consistent with the law.

 

Sincerely,

Deanne

Hello Max, 

I am writing to inform you about the recent completion of a search for reassignment within FEMA, conducted as a reasonable accommodation in alignment with the criteria you provided.

Mr. Carter would be pleased to discuss any specific vacancies you believe may align with your qualifications, with or without reasonable accommodations.

Furthermore, for any questions or further clarification regarding the next steps or other matters related to our efforts to provide you with reasonable accommodation, please contact Mr. Alejandro Ortiz, Disability Program Manager, Office of Equal Rights, at alejandro.ortiz@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:alejandro.ortiz@fema.dhs.gov> .

Attached are the two invoices I have billed on your matter. As we discussed I did not bill you for our discussion after the mediation, and I am willing to still discuss with you next steps and options and have some unbilled discussions. I will see what I can find out about attorneys that specialize in this type of matter, and will work on contingency. 

 

As I stated I am not opposed to potentially working the matter on contingency, but will have to do some research. Make payments towards this balance when you can. I don't want you and your family to stress my bill over other higher priority needs. 

 

I am disappointed that it seemed like nobody was really willing to find a workable solution, but unfortunately I am not surprised. 

 

Regards,

Brent

	I went back and looked at the Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and found this. Which is different than my initial understanding of essential function accommodation. The relevant passage is below:

	 

	There are several modifications or adjustments that are not considered forms of reasonable accommodation. An employer does not have to eliminate an essential function, i.e., a fundamental duty of the position. This is because a person with a disability who is unable to perform the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, is not a ""qualified"" individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Nor is an employer required to lower production standards -- whether qualitative or quantitative -- that are applied uniformly to employees with and without disabilities. However, an employer may have toprovide reasonable accommodation to enable an employee with a disability tomeet the production standard. While an employer is not required to eliminate an essential function or lower a production standard, it may do so if it wishes.

	 

	The problem I have is that they have accommodated this for years, and even the fact that they require in office less than 40% of the time. It seems to me they could if they chose to accommodate around this essential function. Maybe a reasonable accommodation is some level of in office that is less than what is required but you do occasionally work in office. I am just not sure how much they are willing to work with you. I also realize that this mediation is not exactly for the accommodations portions, but I do not see why they cannot eliminate the issue by finding a compromise.

	 

	Regards,

	Brent

		I think at this point we should attend the meeting. I recommend we not bring it up or discuss it unless they do. I agree that an attorney wrote the letter. There is certainly language designed to argue that because you cannot perform the essential function of deploying that is the grounds for the denial.  

		 

		It is my argument though that it is an essential function that can be accommodated. Further, they have accommodated for years, and in a way by only requiring 4 in office attendance days per pay period they essentially make the in office requirement less than the ability to work via telework anyway. That in and of itself tells me that they can accommodate, it is a reasonable accommodation, but they are refusing to recognize that. I believe I know the reason as we discussed, but unfortunately that will be very difficult to prove. But I believe that it is in bad faith, and again unfortunately will likely require a lawsuit to get the relief I believe you are entitled to and not exactly a great option to pursue.

			IMO, the RA request, and the current ADR are separate tracks and Tony may or may not be aware of it.

			The letter sounds/reads as if it was written by an attorney though, just saying.

			And… we are in the middle of the EEO process right now, the ADR we are having meetings about.

			The meeting is still a go and, unless I bring it up, not sure of anyone in the call, except me and you, would be aware of the letter, but I’m not sure of that at all.

			The letter may have been written by the lawyer attending the meetings.

			From the beginning I have believed they are just simply wrong that they cannot accommodate you in this manner simply by saying deployment is an essential function that cannot be accommodated by telework. It looks like they are really going to just push this and force you to file a lawsuit or give up. I am not sure what to advise on how to handle it. 

			 

			You have 45 days to address this with EEO. It might be worth looking for and discussing with an EEO specialty attorney. I can try and talk with the attorneys I know to see if they know of anyone or work on those types of cases. Especially if we can find one willing to take it on contingency. 

			 

			Also what does this mean for the reset on the mediation Wednesday, December 4th?

I've pulled together some basic legalease that I believe will be helpful in the complaint. The TLDR is just looking at the highlight and bold text will give you the basics, but I've included context. all links should work but if not the docs are also dropped into the drive. 
Also, I've dropped a ppt that the federal government made for employers on how to do telework, if anyone wants to see that as well.

Workplace Harassment Prevention Training - PA Reservists,"Good afternoon, 

 

The Workplace Harassment Prevention Training on the 2018 Mandatory training matrix has been released. This training has a ½ hour completion time. The training requires content review and subsequent validation of that review.  DHS is directing a 100% completion of this training for all employees and a deadline has been set for March 23, 2018. If accessible, FEKC is the preferred method of delivery and validation. 

 

Non-deployed RSV: Please find the attached slides provided by OCCHCO. Please sign the last sheet of the PDF so that we may document your completion. This course is reimbursable for ½ hour using the standard WMD Mandatory Training WebTA code for non-deployed RSV only. Once the Cadre has documentation, your timekeeper will input the time on your timecard for certification. 

 

If you have any additional questions or concerns,  please feel free to contact FEMA-PA-Reservist-Program@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-PA-Reservist-Program@fema.dhs.gov> .

Subject: Complaint

 

I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby submitting the attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation.

I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible detriment of my employment.

I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth.

I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2018 when deployed to the Beaumont East team.

I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants Manager Metrics.

I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current deployment here in Houston.

I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is inherently unfair.

A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we never discussed the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same.

Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.  

I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify.

I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with them also because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed.

I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well.

Our HQ’s EEO office has received the attached email regarding disability and alleged discrimination inquiries.  Our office do not process complaints or disability items for FEMA employees.

 

As a FEMA employee, the process is for you to reach out to the FEMA’s Office of Equal Rights (OER). I am forwarding your email to the Reasonable Accommodations Program Manager, Foudiya Henri and the Information Complaints Manager/staff, Nicole Oke, Regina McPhie to learn how best they can assist you in processing your requests. 

 

I encourage you to reach out to them if you have further questions or would like to begin the Informal complaints process.

I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby submitting the attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation.

I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible detriment of my employment.

I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth.

I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2017 when deployed to the Beaumont East team.

I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants Manager Metrics.

I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current deployment here in Houston.

I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is inherently unfair.

A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we never discussed the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same.

Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.  

I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify.

I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with them also because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed.

I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well.

Aileen,

I appreciate very much and would like to thank you for the time you spent speaking with me yesterday.

In an effort to quantify or communicate my frustration with the entire event, please review the attached “performance based” document obtained from the Grants Manager metrics.

My efforts in my position are reflected in the number of created projects to the number of applicant signed projects.

My efforts represent a pretty decent percentage of the metrics for both the TFL and the DPAG and yet I am chastised for “not communicating” which, in my mind, implies I am a poor performer which would be in direct contravention to the “production metrics” of the very software program we use to process applicants.

I am just trying to convey my utter confusion and distaste  for what has transpired thus far.

In closing, I want to again convey my sincere appreciation for you and what you do.

I look forward to your assistance and guidance as I travel down this very new path.

Subject: RA Request

 

Greetings, Ms. McAllister:

 

It was a pleasure to talk to you on the phone. Per our conversation, Mr. Max Meindl has filed a request for a reasonable accommodation. I am the Reasonable Accommodation Analyst assigned to the case and will be working with you on the request. If you are not familiar with the process, the reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not be shared with anyone that does not have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR), no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA), attached.  The request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form (Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), or the SOR is not familiar with the employee’s circumstances, the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to support the need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information:

 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability

•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs 

•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the individual’s position 

•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the individual’s position

•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position 

 

Since the medical provider may not be familiar with the essential functions of the employee’s position, here is some guidance to be applied in making the decision, regarding how essential functions are determined, as outlined in FEMA’s RA policy:

 

Essential functions are “those job duties so fundamental to the position that the individual holds or desires that he/she cannot do the job without performing them. A function can be “essential” if, among other things, the position exists specifically to perform that function; there are a limited number of other employees who could perform the function; and/or the function is highly specialized and the individual is hired based on his/her expertise or ability to perform it. Determination of the essential functions of a position must be done on a case-by-case basis so that it reflects the job as actually performed, and not simply the components of a generic position description.”

 

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the interactive discussion, if needed. OER’s role is to assist managers with the timely processing of reasonable accommodation requests consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA RA Policy.  A supervisor has 30 days to make a decision on the employee’s request.  As the RA Analyst assigned to this case, I will provide advice to you regarding the law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the language of the response to the RA, if needed. I have also attached Mr. Meindl’s RA information sheet for you. Please also note that page 2 of the 256 Form must be filled out by you, with block 2 indicating whether the request is granted, and block 16 providing an explanation for what is being granted, and for what period of time. I have attached a blank 256 Form so that you can complete and return page 2 of it to me. I have also attached the medical documentation provided by Mr. Meindl’s health care provider. Because it includes pii, I have password protected it. The password will be sent to you in a separate email. If you have any questions, or need any assistance, please let me know. I look forward to working with you.

 

Respectfully,

Subject: RE: FMLA

 

Good morning Mr. Meindl,

 

You need to communicate to your supervisor of record the need take FMLA leave at least 30 calendar days before the start of the planned absence. I have attached the Absence and Leave Manual for your review. Chapter 5 addresses FMLA. 

 

I have also received the medical certification in connection with your request for FMLA leave.; however, the following required information is missing from the medical certification or is vague and needs clarification: 

 

1.	It is not clear whether you need FMLA leave intermittently or for a continuous period of time or both. 

	a.	If your FMLA leave is for a continuous period of time, your doctor needs to state so. In the medical documentation you provided it only states “a few days after heart surgery”.  In addition, the your doctor will need to include the date of your surgery.
	b.	If your request is for intermittent leave for a planned medical treatment, the dates (actual or estimates) on which such treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treatment, and the period of recovery, if any, before you would be able to return to work;

 

2.	Your medical provider stated that your condition will cause episodic flare ups; however, the certification is missing the frequency of the flare ups. The medical certification needs to include an estimate of the frequency of the flare ups and the duration of related incapacity that you may have over the next 6 months (Part B, question #7).

 

Please be advised that the complete medical documentation is due 15 calendar days from this email. 

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Thank you,

Subject: Welcome to Public Assistance

 

Welcome to the PA Cadre!!

 

We know you will cover a wealth of FEMA information while at EMO and are probably wondering how in the world you will retain all of it…don’t worry, you will.  Most of the information you will receive talks about FEMA as a whole, who our partners are and how we coordinate with them for a whole community approach to disaster management.  As a reminder, if you have any questions, please reach out to us, your Cadre Management Team, at the Reservist Inbox: FEMA-PA-Reservist-Program@fema.dhs.gov <mailto:FEMA-PA-Reservist-Program@fema.dhs.gov>  or call us via our Support Line at 202-212-1028 during normal business hours: Monday through Friday 8am-5pm EST, with the exception of weekends and Federal holidays. (These two methods are your first line of communication with your management team.)

 

We have attached some helpful tools and resources to assist in your transition: 

*	Conditions of Employment- these are the expectations of all FEMA employees (Signature not required) 
*	Type of Reservist Unavailability
*	New PA Delivery Model Progression Chart
*	Old PA Delivery Model Progression Chart

*        New PA Delivery Model

*        PA Fact Sheet

 

Last but not least.  The only training requirement needed to deploy is the completion of Emergency Management Orientation, which you are currently attending.  

 

Deployment Expectations:

It is not likely that you will be immediately deployed following your completion of EMO.  Deployment requests are initiated by a Presidential declaration followed by a field assessment and submission of staff requirements needed to fulfill the mission.  Staff are deployed via our automated system (DTS) by FQS title to ensure a fair and equitable process in deploying. So please be patient in our process. 

 

OPM Background Investigation:

You will, if you haven’t already, receive a call from an OPM Investigator to set up an appointment to discuss your equip and information within.  Please note this is legal and is required by you to complete as a government employee. 

 

Again, Welcome to the PA Cadre! We are excited to have you on our team.  If you have questions, please give us a shout.  

 

Respectfully, 

 

Cadre Management

Attached please find FMLA request.

Rachel is out of the hospital but the recovery process is a bit problematic and challenging, still a touch and go situation.

She is still learning to walk along with all of the other healing challenges.

My daughter and I are assisting with her recovery efforts.

Any questions feel free to contact me.

Subject: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl 
 

Good afternoon Max, 

On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a serious/chronic health condition.  Given that it has now been more than thirty (30) calendar days since your last medical update for your current FMLA condition, I am requesting that you provide me with an FMLA recertification as it relates to your current FMLA condition of record.  The recertification is now necessary to ensure that the workload on your team can be planned and managed effectively while assisting you during your time of recovery.  Therefore, I am requesting that you work with your physician to respond to all questions where appropriate especially those related to the questions identified below. These questions are not separate and apart from the recertification form but can be responded to within the context of the questions already provided on the form.  (29 CFR 825.308(a), permits recertification every 30 days for chronic or permanent/long-term conditions.)  

Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update:

  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the specific condition listed on your FMLA application dated and signed by your physician, on 4/11/2019.      

  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your condition & if you will be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time.  (See questions #1 & #4).

  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned appointments within the next 30 days. (See Question #5)

  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, including any time for recovery.  (See Question #6)

  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will have flare-ups during your recovery period (if known) that will prevent you from performing your job functions. (See question #7).

Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My goal remains to work cooperatively with you and your physician in a manner which affords you the best opportunity to recover and return to full time employment status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA Recertification information within fifteen (15) working days of receipt will result in the denial of any FMLA related leave until the information is provided. 

If you experience difficulty providing this information within the specified period, please see me, or in my absence Patricia David, and provide a brief written statement documenting your hardship and your request for extension will be responded to within three (3) working days.

Regards,

Good afternoon, 

 

The FMLA update process being applied in this situation is consistent with policy. Your approved FMLA condition of record is the matter being addressed as it relates to the updates being requested. You have said in your response that you are not scheduled to see the physician until next year and that you will request an appointment and attempt to get one as soon as possible. I will follow up with you in seven (7) days to see if you were able to get an appointment for this matter. 

 

In the meantime I will recommend to your supervisor to continue to approve your current FMLA request for the said condition until you have an appointment scheduled. The specifics of the concerns is that your current FMLA is approved for 1-3 occurrences every month and you have exceeded the frequency so your management is attempting to obtain updated information. 

 

Thanks for your cooperation with this matter. Please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns. 

 

Regards,

JG,

My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose, throat) group at the DeBakey VA hospital to attempt to ascertain the source for my recurring dizzy spells.

My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020.

My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is also next year.

I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient clinic, but I’m not sure if that can happen within 15 days, it is the VA, so nothing is for certain.

I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private physician in Bellville.

I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has identified, in the onboarding process, as an individual with a disability and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent associated health issues, I am concerned about the way the institution and/or individuals within the institution, treat those identified as disabled, more specifically, myself.  

If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn’t and I don’t understand.  

It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my opinion.

I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my recovery but, I must admit that it has been an extremely distasteful experience with other FEMA personnel.

 

I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am concerned about the 15 day window.

 

Please advise.

What Happened

UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest health insurer, shook markets last week after slashing its 2025 profit outlook. The culprit was a sharp and unexpected rise in healthcare usage among seniors enrolled in its Medicare Advantage plans. 

The announcement triggered the company's biggest single-day stock drop in over 25 years, effectively wiping out billions in value. These effects were hardly contained to United. The sell-off spread like wildfire across the industry, hitting major players such as Humana, Elevance Health, and CVS Health. 

Wall Street heard one thing loud and clear: the Medicare Advantage model might be more fragile than anyone thought. UnitedHealth reported that older Americans were visiting doctors, specialists, and outpatient clinics at far higher rates than projected. 

Since insurers get paid a fixed rate per enrollee from the federal government, more care means more costs and less profit.

Why It Matters

Medicare Advantage covers more than 30 million Americans. 

These plans, run by private insurers but funded by Medicare, have grown in popularity for their low premiums and extra perks like dental, vision, and gym memberships. However, these extra benefits rely on careful cost controls. 

When patients use more healthcare than expected, the entire model starts to wobble. Insurers rely heavily on accurate predictions of both risk and utilization to remain profitable. UnitedHealth’s miss would suggest that perhaps those predictions are failing. 

What’s even more concerning is that this spike in usage isn’t tied to any single cause. It could be due to pent-up demand from the pandemic, an aging population with more complex health needs, or just a breakdown in preventative care. 

Whatever the cause, it has caught insurers flat-footed. If this trend holds, a chain reaction is likely imminent. Insurers will likely look to cut back benefits, increase premiums, and narrow provider networks to protect their margins. 

This means seniors could soon find themselves with less coverage and higher out-of-pocket costs. 


How It Affects You

Medicare Advantage plans may soon become far less generous, less flexible, and more expensive. For many, the annual enrollment period could start to feel like picking the lesser of two evils. 

It's unlikely that the shift will stop with retirees. If Medicare Advantage loses its popularity, more Americans may return to traditional Medicare, which comes with its own gaps in coverage. This would increase pressure on the broader Medicare system, which is already facing long-term funding challenges. 

For younger Americans, this could be a preview of things to come. A model built on low-cost private management of public healthcare is only sustainable if the math works. But as of right now, that math is looking shaky.

RE: RAR0023261 - Vaccine Exemption Request for Information,"I share your suspicion.  I think you should respond and copy the same people you originally filed it with and correct the record.  These monsters will use any reason to deny the exemption.

Todd,

When considering the emailed documents from FEMA to me, I was wondering.  Are there any legal ramifications to the following; my name is spelled wrong and the letters aren't signed by anyone?  Also, can the FEMA Vaccine Exemption board be anonymous?

	HI Max, 

	

	 

	

	I reviewed the un-signed letter of January 6th, 2022 from FEMA case # RAR0023261.

	

	 

	

	I will update your report into a significantly expanded format and language. Their request stating “must come from a licensed medical professional familiar with your medical condition” looks like an attempt to narrow and make it harder to provide the information. 

	

	Based on our consultation, I am familiar with your medical condition, it will be on letterhead and properly signed with state license numbers etc.. There will be an expanded section stating the risks etc., within the timeframe allowed. 

	

	 

	

	Sincerely, 

	

	 

	

	Dr. Lionberger

Subject: From the Mission Support Corner - Important Information

 

Hello Region 6,

 

Here are this week’s Mission Support topics of interest.  Another long one but making up for last week.  There is important information here for all.

 

Vaccination Updates – Submitting a Reasonable Accommodation

As many of you know, the DHS Office of the Under Secretary for Management sent a communication yesterday with updated information regarding compliance with EO on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees (attached for reference).  

 

Important Reminder About DHS Vaccination Status System (VSS) <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/vss> 

*	All FEMA employees, including those who seek an exemption from the vaccination requirement for religious or medical reasons, must complete and submit their vaccination status via the VSS by November 9, 2021.  
*	The option of “I decline to respond” is no longer available after the new version was released.  Instead, the system has three options to select from:  

	*	I am fully vaccinated.  You must also upload proof of vaccination.
	*	I am in the process of becoming fully vaccinated.
	*	I am not vaccinated.

*	If you have requested or plan to request an exemption, select the “I am not vaccinated"" option in VSS. 
*	We understand there have been problems with the VSS system and adding insults to injury, after the release of their latest version, a lot of responses were reset back to zero.   If you receive a notice from your supervisor, please be sure to take the time to go back in and record your status.
*	Some people keep getting messages to upload their proof of vaccination, even though they already uploaded it and the system accepted it.  This could be due to the quality of the image.  If you continue to get a message from the system to upload proof of vaccination, try uploading a clear copy.

 

Employees seeking a religious or medical exemption or delay in taking the vaccination must submit their request by accessing the DHS Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS) and completing the applicable electronic form specifically developed for exemption requests to the vaccine requirement.  There is one form for medical accommodation requests, and one for religious accommodations.  The link to ACMS is provided here: https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast> .   Please reference the OAST - User Guide on how to submit a COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate as a Reasonable Accommodation (servicenowservices.com) <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast?id=dhs_universal_kb_article&sys_id=4498112b1b977410b7ec2f85624bcbcb>  for step by step instructions on how to complete this. 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you already submitted an accommodation via the ACMS system, you will have to submit a new one.  The reason is they updated the questions and you will be required to answer all mandatory questions to successfully submit your accommodation request.

 

Vaccine Mandate and Workers Compensation

Rob and I have been making the rounds to your Division staff meetings to answer and collect questions you may have.  

One of the questions asked was: can employees file a Worker’s Compensation claim if they have side effects from the vaccine when complying with the Executive Order?  

The answer is yes.  If an employee who obtained the vaccine after the September 9, 2021 mandate suffers adverse effects, they can file a claim via the ECOMP - U.S. Department of Labor (dol.gov) <https://www.ecomp.dol.gov/#/>  portal.  For reference, here is the Department of Labor bulletin - - FECA Bulletins (2020-2024) | U.S. Department of Labor (dol.gov) <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/owcp/FECA/regs/compliance/DFECfolio/FECABulletins/FY2020-2024#FECAB2201> .

 

Finally, if you have questions about the safety of the vaccine, please, contact your primary health care provider.  They know your medical history and can answer your questions.    

 

 

COVID-19 EPL for SAE

Great news!  Mission Support announced the implementation of the COVID-19 Emergency Leave for CORE and Reservist Employees (see attached email for reference).  FEMA Directive #403-21-0001: COVID Emergency Leave for Stafford Act Employees (Interim) <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/teams/OPPAPolicy/Lists/Policy%20Master%20List/Attachments/1151/FEMA%20Directive%20Emergency%20Leave%20for%20Stafford%20Act%20INTERIM%20FINAL%20508.pdf>  provides a benefit to Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE) and Reservist employees under certain eligibility conditions related to COVID-19.  These benefits are retroactive and apply to a Period of Availability (POA) between March 11, 2021 and November 1, 2021. Employees must submit and obtain approval to use this benefit no later than December 31, 2021. 

 

 

2021 Voting

This off-year, many states will hold elections on Tuesday November 2, 2021.  FEMA’s policy is to encourage employees to exercise their voting rights.  Many states have early voting and we encourage employees to take advantage of that.  

 

As a general rule, where the polls are not open at least 3 hours either before or after an employee's regular hours of work he or she may be granted an amount of administrative leave which will permit him or her to report for work 3 hours after the polls open or leave work 3 hours before the polls close, whichever requires the lesser amount of time off.   For example, if an employee is scheduled to work from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and the employee’s polling place is open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., the employee should not be granted excused absence for voting, since the employee has 3 hours after the end of their normal work schedule to vote. However, if the polling place closes at 7:00 p.m., the employee may be granted 30 minutes of administrative leave from 4:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., if requested.  

 

FEMA-Mission-Support-News will be sending a message with more information on this.

 

IT Changes Coming

The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has announced a few changes that are coming and that will affect how FEMA employees access information.   One of the changes is that Home drives will be going away.   This is expected to happen next year, but as always, this can change.  The OCIO encourages all employees to use OneDrive, as this allows you access to all your files from your laptop and mobile device. 

 

Another change is the Internet Explorer (IE) browser will go away next year.   Employees are encouraged to use Microsoft Edge as the primary browser.  This is really important: if you know of any applications that do not work with Edge – e.g. ECAPS, DFSC, etc. – please notify our IT Branch via a FEMA Region 6 Self-Service <https://r6apps.fema.net/>  helpdesk ticket so they can elevate to HQ for them to work on it.  This will help us ensure smooth transition when the IE browser finally goes away.

 

 

Financial Webinars

FedHR relaunched the eSeminar Financial Planning & Benefits feature.   This feature offers on-line self-study modules designed for individual Federal employees to learn more about their retirement and benefit programs.  If you want to learn more about how your Federal government annuity is calculated and what you need to do to prepare for retirement, these self-study eSeminars are a great tool.  To access the eSeminars, when you are logged into FHR, from the Home page, look on the left side menu and under Learn about My Benefits, click on eSeminar Financial Planning & Benefits.  You will be able to navigate to different courses.  In addition, you can access the eBenefits Orientation and Retirement Info for more resources.   We encourage you to take advantage of these.  It is never too early to start planning for retirement. 

 



 

 

FEMA Launched Headspace App for Employees

FEMA has partnered with Headspace <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/FEMA/SitePages/Headspace.aspx>  to provide employees with a health and wellness app.   The app can be your personalized health and wellness guide, with hundreds of meditations and exercises for sleep, focus and movement. Headspace has shown to have favorable outcomes, including reduced stress and improved focus. When we take care of ourselves, we can take care of our mission. 

 

Account Registration
You must register for an account to take advantage of our partnership.  The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO) has posted step-by-step instructions to help you through the process. Register for an account. <https://usfema.sharepoint.com/sites/FEMA/SitePages/Headspace.aspx>    If you do not have the Headspace app available on your phone, you can download it from the Comp Portal.  My understanding is that the app will be pushed to all phones soon.

 

Thank you for everything you do.  Stay safe and well!

 

 

If I  may be of any assistance, let me know.

November 8, 2021

 

Colleagues,

 

Over the last couple of weeks you’ve received a good deal of communication with information about President Biden’s September 9 Executive Order (EO) on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees <https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/> . I know it’s a lot to digest, but it’s important that we all understand the requirements <https://dhsconnect.dhs.gov/org/comp/mgmt/dhshr/Health-Safety/Pages/Vaccine-Status-System.aspx>  and the part we each play in reaching the November 22, 2021 deadline. 

 

It’s not too late to meet the EO deadline. Employees who receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine <http://www.vaccines.gov>  today will be in full compliance with the EO by November 22. Remember, you can use duty time this afternoon to go and get your vaccine. 

 

I understand that some of you may be on the fence or even against getting the vaccine. DHS and the American people value you and the work you do, which is done often at great personal sacrifice. However, we all must do our part to move past this pandemic and the first step is everyone getting vaccinated. Employees who do not comply with the requirement to become vaccinated will be subject to formal discipline, up to and including removal from federal service.   

 

By tomorrow, November 9: 

 

*	If you are vaccinated and haven’t done so already, provide your proof of vaccination via the Vaccine Status System <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/vss> . More than 70% of our employees have already provided their vaccination status in the VSS or their Components system of record. For everyone who has completed this critical action, thank you! 
*	If you wish to request a religious or medical exemption or delay in taking the vaccination you should submit your request for a reasonable accommodation from the EO requirements by accessing the Accessibility Compliance Management System <https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast>  (ACMS).

Message on DHS Vaccine Exemption Requests

 

Colleagues,

 

Throughout the past few weeks, DHS has shared guidance on how to request a legally required exemption to President Biden’s September 9 Executive Order (EO) on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees <https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/> , which mandates all federal employees to be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021.  If an employee is unable to comply with the vaccination mandate because of a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, or because of documented medical circumstances that require additional time to comply with the mandate, they should make their requests for a vaccination exemption as soon as possible.

 

If seeking a vaccination exemption or delay as a reasonable accommodation, employees are encouraged to use the DHS Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS).  The link to ACMS, along with a helpful ACMS user guide, is available here: https://dhs.servicenowservices.com/oast.  ACMS provides easy access to electronic accommodation forms for both religious and medical requests.  The forms are specifically designed to ensure that each employee provides sufficient information and documentation to enable the decision makers to fully consider the employee’s individual needs.  If an employee is unable to access ACMS or needs assistance from a family member or other representative in requesting a vaccination exemption, the accommodation forms are available and can be downloaded from the DHS.gov website at Reasonable Accommodations (dhs.gov) <https://dhsconnect.dhs.gov/org/offices/crcl/eeo/Pages/Reasonable-Accommodations-at-DHS.aspx> , along with guidance on where to send the forms for processing after completion.

 

Once a final determination is made on the request, ACMS will email the employee about the determination.  If the employee’s request for a religious or medical exemption or delay is approved, the employee will be given notice as to what alternative protective measures will be provided as an accommodation.  If an employee’s request for an exemption is denied, the employee must receive their one-dose vaccine or their first dose of the two-dose vaccine within 14 days of the date of denial. If receiving a two-dose series, the employee must receive the second dose within six weeks of receiving the first dose. Employees with pending exemption requests who must report to a work site will be provided guidance on interim protective measures that must be followed.

 

For additional guidance and assistance, a link to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to the vaccination mandate and the accommodation process is provided here:  Reasonable Accommodations (dhs.gov) <https://dhsconnect.dhs.gov/org/offices/crcl/eeo/Pages/Reasonable-Accommodations-at-DHS.aspx> .
