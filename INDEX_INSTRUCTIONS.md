   - From/to parties
   - Subject line
   - Which violation it relates to
   - Response time (if any)
   - Exhibit number

### For Correlation:
- Each event has an ID (AV-001, RE-001, etc.)

- Link emails to specific violations
- Track damages to specific events

### For Settlement/Trial:
- Sort timeline_index by date for chronology
- Sort damages_index by amount for impact
