3. **Request Remedy**
   - Supplement ROI
   - Additional discovery
   - Adverse inference
   - Summary judgment

## Key EEOC Directives & Regulations

### Interactive Process
- **MD-110**: Chapter 6, Section IV.C - Interactive Process Requirements
- **EEOC_Guidance**: EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation (2002)
- **regulation**: 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(3)

### Investigation Requirements
- **MD-110**: Chapter 7 - Conducting a Complete Investigation
- **timeliness**: 29 CFR 1614.108(e) - 180 day requirement

### Burden Of Proof
- **accommodation**: Employer must prove undue hardship - 42 USC 12112(b)(5)(A)

## Sample Language for Briefs

### Interactive Process Failure
"The ROI demonstrates respondent's complete failure to engage in the interactive process required by 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(3). Specifically, [cite ROI pages] show no documentation of any interactive meetings, no consideration of alternatives, and no timely responses to accommodation requests. This per se violation of the ADA shifts the burden entirely to respondent."

### Investigation Bias
"The ROI's systematic crediting of management witnesses while discounting employee testimony, without articulated credibility findings, violates MD-110's requirement of impartial investigation. See [ROI pages]. This bias permeates the ROI and renders its conclusions unreliable."

### Missing Evidence
"The ROI's failure to collect critical evidence including [list], despite complainant identifying these materials, constitutes an incomplete investigation under MD-110 Chapter 7. The agency cannot meet its burden when it failed to gather probative evidence."

## Next Steps

1. **Review ROI** with this checklist
2. **Document** each contradiction found
3. **Gather** supporting evidence
4. **Draft** legal arguments
5. **File** appropriate motions
