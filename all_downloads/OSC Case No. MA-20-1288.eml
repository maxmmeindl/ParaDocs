Hello Mr. Meindl:



As you are aware, I have been investigating the above referenced OSC compla=
int in which you allege that you were retaliated against for filing an EEO =
complaint to FEMA=92s Director of Civil Rights and the Department of Homela=
nd Security=92s EEOC Office, and for e-mailing FEMA=92s Chief of Staff Sand=
ra Cooley regarding issues you had with management=92s processing of your F=
MLA request. Specifically, you were retaliated against by not being selecte=
d for a position of Task Force Lead and were written up for copying and pas=
ting a co-worker=92s written response and sending it to another co-worker.


While discrimination based on handicapping conditions, as well as reprisal =
for filing an EEO complaint, are prohibited personnel practices, OSC=92s re=
gulation 5 C.F.R. =A7 1810.1 notes that it was not intended for OSC to dupl=
icate or bypass the procedures established by the agencies and the Equal Em=
ployment Opportunity Commission for resolving such allegations. Therefore, =
it is the general policy of the Special Counsel not to take action on such =
allegations as they are more appropriately resolved through the EEO process=
. Because of these constraints, we have made a determination to close your =
case. Please understand that we are not saying your circumstances have been=
 easy, ideal or completely fair.



Best,

Marko Cvijanovic
Attorney
U.S. Office of Special Counsel
Dallas Field Office
