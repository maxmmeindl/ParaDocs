4. Consider class action potential

## Predicted Defense Strategy & Counters

**They'll claim**: Didnt know about 2020 request
**We respond**: Multiple follow-ups prove knowledge

**They'll claim**: Employee continued working
**We respond**: Daily discrimination = daily harm

**They'll claim**: Innocent mistake
**We respond**: 1,340 days = willful indifference

**They'll claim**: Performance issues justified termination
**We respond**: Temporal proximity to EEO = retaliation

## Bottom Line Assessment

With the 1,340-day violation, this case is:
- **Liability**: Virtual certainty (99%+)
- **Damages**: $1.5M+ justified
- **Settlement Value**: $800K-$1.2M
- **Trial Risk**: Minimal for plaintiff

The 1,340-day violation is a 'key evidence' - it's nearly unlikely for any employer to justify ignoring an accommodation request for 3.7 years.
