# Hearing Preparation Outline
## EEOC Case No. HS-FEMA-02430-2024

---

## OPENING STATEMENT

Your Honor, this case is about 1,340 days. That's how long FEMA ignored Max Meindl's request for reasonable accommodation. Not denied itâ€”ignored it. For nearly four years, Mr. Meindl sent email after email, made request after request, and received nothing but silence in return.

When he finally filed an EEO complaint about this treatment, FEMA's response was swift and brutal: they terminated him. The evidence will show this is one of the most egregious cases of disability discrimination and retaliation in federal employment.

## KEY THEMES

1. **Deliberate Indifference**: 1,340 days speaks for itself
2. **Pattern of Retaliation**: Every action after EEO filing was adverse
3. **No Interactive Process**: Not one conversation about accommodations
4. **Documentary Evidence**: 78 emails tell the complete story
5. **Temporal Proximity**: Retaliation began immediately after complaint
