## Strategic Recommendations

### For ADR Preparation:
1. **Review Table B-20** for ADR success rates to set realistic expectations
2. **Analyze Table B-21** for typical benefits/remedies in settlements
3. **Check Table B-15** for discrimination finding rates in similar cases

### For AJ Hearing Preparation:
1. **Study Table B-17** for AJ decision implementation timelines
2. **Review Table B-15 & B-16** for discrimination vs. no discrimination findings
3. **Examine Table B-8** for complaint basis statistics to show pattern

### Key Data Points to Emphasize:
- Federal agency ADA complaint rates and outcomes
- FEMA/DHS specific complaint patterns (if available in sub-component data)
- Average processing times vs. your case timeline
- Settlement amounts and remedies in similar cases

## Next Steps

1. **Extract specific statistics** from identified tables
2. **Create visual charts** showing relevant trends
3. **Build timeline comparison** with EEOC averages
4. **Compile precedent cases** from similar complaints
5. **Prepare statistical evidence package** for ADR/hearing
