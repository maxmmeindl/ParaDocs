REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TIMING VIOLATIONS ANALYSIS
============================================================
Case: HS-FEMA-02430-2024
Generated: May 25, 2025


SUMMARY FOR LEGAL ARGUMENT:
------------------------------------------------------------
FEMA violated federal reasonable accommodation law by:
1. Taking 36 days to respond (exceeds 30-day standard)
2. Failing to engage in ANY interactive process
3. Providing no explanation for the delay
4. Denying without considering alternatives

This constitutes a per se violation of:
- 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(3) (interactive process)
- EO 13164 (30-day federal requirement)
- EEOC MD-110 Chapter 6 (timely response)

The 36-day delay alone establishes liability, as FEMA cannot
show any legitimate reason for exceeding federal timeframes while
completely failing to communicate with the employee.
