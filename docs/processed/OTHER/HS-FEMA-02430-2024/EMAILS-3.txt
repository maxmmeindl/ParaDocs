To clarify, 
Yesterday you advised me that I could comment/upload in my evaluation pursuant to the points you initially proffered as 
concerns in my review, is that correct? 
It was nice making your acquaintance also, and here’s wishing you the best in your endeavors.

Good Morning Max, 

Very glad to meet you yesterday. The performance comments provided by Detra have been uploaded into FedHR under 
your case #248282 and I have also attached them. I believe that I have resolved the issue of the reviews being locked. 
HR sometimes locks the forms while they are working on them, and it’s not uncommon to have this issue. Please go 
ahead and sign Quarter 2 and Quarter 3.  

Quarter 2 documents in FEDHR were your Individual Development Plan that you had previously signed and a PDF of the 
performance goals.

From the Sit With Guidance document: 
PAGS Sit-With Guidance 
What is a sit-with? 
A sit-with is a one-on-one feedback coaching session between a manager and staff.  Staff will  
participate in an initial sit-with with their manager, during which they will discuss their previous disaster roles, particular 
technical specialties and skill sets. This discussion will inform leadership on the level of complexity for a staff’s assignment.

benefit of the hug, more like a ganging up on the new guy.

Subject: RE: OER AHU-18-164 Closure Letter 

To whom it may concern, 
I find the letter closing this complaint of harassment specious and inaccurate at best. 
The statement that an investigation was conducted and “witness statement” and/or “evidence collected” led to 
allegations being unsubstantiated, is interesting at a minimum. 
Pursuant to the attachment in this email and a copy of a previously sent email, sent to, what I assume to be the primary 
investigator, stipulated in no uncertain terms that there were no witnesses to the alleged harassment and that the 
harassment was my perception of an escalation or a previous meeting wherein I had been inappropriately accused and 
unprofessionally addressed in front of other parties. 
The harassment claim has to do with my perception of the escalation only, no witnesses involved. 

Below is a copy of the email stipulating my concerns when I filed the complaint:

Subject: cover email 
I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby submitting the 
attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation. 
I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible detriment of my 
employment. 
I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth. 
I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2017 when deployed to the Beaumont East team. 
I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants Manager 
Metrics. 
I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current deployment 
here in Houston. 
I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is inherently unfair. 
A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we never discussed 
the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same. 
Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.   
I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify. 
I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with them also 
because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed. 
I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well. 
Please contact me with any questions, guidance, advice if required. 
Please advise soonest. 

Thank you in advance.

Hello Mr. Meindl and Mr. Walters, 

I received an email from Erik Skinner, OER, on Friday letting me know that things are on track for scheduling the 
mediation conference call. 

I will be at a mediation conference this week (week of Oct. 1) and unavailable for mediation.  If you could send me some 
dates you are available the week of Oct. 8 and the week of Oct. 15,  I will coordinate with all of our schedules, and 
confirm the first date/time that works for everyone. 

Thank you for your assistance with scheduling and I look forward to hearing from you, 

Karen

cover email

I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby 
submitting the attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation. 
I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible 
detriment of my employment. 
I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth. 
I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2017 when deployed to the Beaumont East team. 
I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants 
Manager Metrics. 
I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current 
deployment here in Houston. 
I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is 
inherently unfair. 
A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we 
never discussed the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same. 
Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.   
I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify. 
I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with 
them also because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed. 
I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well. 
Please contact me with any questions, guidance, advice if required. 
Please advise soonest. 

Thank you in advance.

If you believe you have been discriminated against and wish to pursue the EEO process, please provide the following 
information 
1.           your name, title and contact phone number; 
a.           Max Meindl, PMP, Emergency Management Specialist (PDMG), 832-293-3671

b.           5 E. Austin, Bellville, TX 77418 (home) 
3.           basis(es) of the alleged discrimination; 
a.           if age is the basis, provide date of birth; 06/21/1951 
b.           if disability is the basis, provide the name of disability;  coronary Artery Disease, possible/leading to Congestive 
Heart Failure (CHF) 
c.            if retaliation is the basis, provide date of prior EEO Activity or the incident you believe to be 
discriminatory;  Believe retaliation was for my determination of applicant eligibility in contravention to prevailing 
thought.  The issue with an applicant, City of Bellaire, pursuant my determination of a policy issue in contradiction to the 
prevailing point of view and that of the TAC PDMG. The apparent consensus for the issue at hand was that the applicant 
was not eligible for a specific claimed damage. After reviewing the available information in the PAPG and information sent 
from the JFO, I concluded that the applicant could possibly be eligible and proffered the opinion that asking or advising 
them to withdraw the claim was incorrect and not supported by the information I had reviewed and that it would be a 
disservice to the applicant to have them withdraw the claim as opposed to the issuance of a Determination Memo (DM). 
With a DM, the applicant at least retains the right to appeal whereas a withdrawal would result in no right to appeal, if I 
understand the process correctly. I had previously obtained approval from the Task Lead to submit an official “Policy 
Inquiry” to the policy team to obtain further clarification and direction. We, TFL and I, discussed the issue and agreed that 
waiting for the policy clarification would be the appropriate path to take. 

4.           a brief bullet list of each incident you believe to be discriminatory to include  
a.           name(s) of the alleged discriminating party; 
                             Jade Harrison 
c.            date(s) of the incident; and  
i.            July 26th 2018

2nd Quarter. The 308 is an expectation plan.  These are generic forms that need to be signed.   Bill Boone will be getting

RE: Conference Call for IDP's

The IDP form has been uploaded into FED HR Navigator.  You will be able to go there and digitally sign your IDB, Plan and 
2nd Quarter. The 308 is an expectation plan.  These are generic forms that need to be signed.   Bill Boone will be getting 
with you in a few months and proceed with the process.    

If you need assistance please reach out to me.  

Thanks,

Subject: FW: Complaint 

I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby 
submitting the attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation. 
I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible 
detriment of my employment. 
I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth. 
I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2017 when deployed to the Beaumont East team. 
I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants 
Manager Metrics. 
I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current 
deployment here in Houston. 
I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is 
inherently unfair. 
A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we 
never discussed the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same. 
Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.   
I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify. 
I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with 
them also because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed. 
I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well. 
Please contact me with any questions, guidance, advice if required.

Sit With 7/27/2018 with PDM Max Meindl: Regarding City of Bellaire project #26570 the Evergreen Traffic Signal 
Cabinets & Controls PDM Mr. Meindl was asked by leadership not to send this project back to the CRC. As this project 
once was sent to the CRC, and the CRC sent it back to the field office for a review of eligibility. This project is in question 
of does the possible reimbursement fall under FHWA or FEMA. This was a transition of projects from TFL Berti and PDM 
Plunkett. The expectation was for Mr. Meindl to work and to collaborate with his teammates during this transition 
period.  

Mr. Meindl researched the eligibility reviewing the PAPPG, FHWA (TFL Berti and PDM Plunkett provided this as well), 
and involved the State counterparts. Mr. Meindl felt after his research that the project was eligible and advanced it back 
to the CRC. The CRC immediately called back to the field office confused why this project was sent back to them.  

Current Status: This project was sent to the LRO for a policy determination/policy inquiry. I did call CRC TFL Andrew 
Makardetsh at the CRC since the project is still active in the CRC. Mr. Makardetsh stated that this project as came back 
and forth from the field office. Mr. Makardetsh stated they (CRC) have forwarded this to the TRO for a Determination 
Memo submission. I stated to Mr. Makardetsh that I felt it is best to keep the current status this way, but I will notify my 
DPAG for her final decision.  

o   In addition, I also attended in person the Weekly Meeting with the PDM and the Applicant. The Applicant 
stated they would appreciate it if we obtain an official review from the FEMA policy team and draft a 
determination memo.  

TFL Kirk Shadowens Sit With - Actions to Mr. Meindl: 

       The expectation was for Mr. Meindl was to follow instructions and guidance from all leadership. TFL and other 
leaders expressed to Mr. Meindl several times the situation of the projects and what next steps to take. Mr. 
Meindl did not execute to this, as Mr. Meindl chose to do what he felt the next process step was to do. As Mr. 
Meindl should have not advanced this project to the CRC, until his TFL granted him permission. The expectation 
moving forward is for Mr. Meindl to notify and involve is TFL or leadership before advancing projects to the CRC. 
       The expectation was for Mr. Meindl to work and to collaborate with his teammates during this transition period. 
Mr. Meindl was communicated from TFL Berti and I that he was expected to work in a team effort with the PDM 
Plunkett. The team effort was requested to Mr. Meindl so that he could gain full status of the transition projects. 
Mr. Meindl during this timeframe displayed poor interaction with staff, communication with staff, and displayed 
poor interaction with his peers and leaders. The expectation moving forward is for Mr. Meindl to work with all 
teammates and leadership. Mr. Meindl needs to involve all teammates when asked, and allow those teammates 
to help assist him with their updated project status, so that the execution of project completion is established by 
an efficient manner.

FEMA Team, 

I would like to reiterate that ensuring FEMA maintains a safe work environment is extremely important to me 
and to my leadership team. As stated in my previous message, you should know that FEMA has a zero-
tolerance policy for all types of harassment. If you feel you have been harassed or if you witness inappropriate 
behavior by anyone against a fellow employee, I am asking you to report it. I am attaching two documents that 
provide information on where you can do so. 

I recognize that you may find it difficult to make allegations about discrimination or harassment of any type. 
You may feel concerned that you are at risk and worry about how filing a complaint may impact your career. I 
want to assure you that any employee can file a complaint without fear of reprisal because I have a zero-
tolerance policy against retaliation. 

Sexual harassment isn’t limited to just making inappropriate advances. It also includes any unwelcome verbal or 
physical behavior that creates a hostile work environment whether it occurs inside or outside the workplace or 
through social media platforms. No one should be subjected to any such behavior by anyone you may come into 
contact with as part of your job, including managers, co-workers, contractors or Agency partners.  

When allegations of this type are brought to the Agency’s attention, I can assure you that they will be 
investigated promptly, and upon conclusion, appropriate action will be taken. As mentioned in Monday’s 
message, my leadership team is establishing an Office of Professional Responsibility to ensure expeditious, fair, 
and objective follow-up and resolution of allegations of misconduct.   

100

 
  
 
 
The attached documents will answer questions about the steps to report harassment claims.  There is also useful 
information on reporting an incident to the Anti-Harassment Unit.  Counseling services and health and wellness 
advisors are available to all FEMA employees who may not have received the support they needed in the past. 

As I’ve said before, everyone in this Agency is responsible for creating a culture of trust, mutual respect, and 
dignity in our treatment of employees and for all of those we serve. I will accept nothing less.   

It’s important to note that the few individuals participating in this behavior by no means define the majority of 
the honorable, well-intentioned, and well-qualified employees who give this Agency their best every day. I want 
you to know I appreciate your efforts and I will always support and defend you.

JH, applicant just clarified that the building I identified as the classrooms on google earth I sent to you is what 
they call the warehouse so no need for adding new DI, appreciate your assistance and attentiveness.  The 
existing DI should capture everything.

Max, 

I reviewed the late submission for the Applicant and it’s for the School, Classroom building/wing which is 
located at the address 2300 Rodney. This address is the same location as the two other line items submitted 
118

  
 
  
  
  
  
  
under this Applicant. Instead of creating a new line item, I think its best to expand the damage line items 
currently under the profile. 

In addition, you may also consider expanding the one damage line item to consolidate the damages for both of 
the current line for the church and warehouse.  

Please review. We can discuss further on tomorrow.

Fwd: Not On My Watch (Part 2): Employee Resources
FactSheet_Harassment_ Employees.pdf; FactSheet_Harassment_ Supervisors and 
Managers.pdf

From: "Office of the Administrator" <officeoftheadministrator@fema.dhs.gov>

Subject: Not On My Watch (Part 2): Employee Resources 

FEMA Team, 

I would like to reiterate that ensuring FEMA maintains a safe work environment is extremely important to me 
and to my leadership team. As stated in my previous message, you should know that FEMA has a zero-
tolerance policy for all types of harassment. If you feel you have been harassed or if you witness inappropriate 
behavior by anyone against a fellow employee, I am asking you to report it. I am attaching two documents that 
provide information on where you can do so. 

I recognize that you may find it difficult to make allegations about discrimination or harassment of any type. 
You may feel concerned that you are at risk and worry about how filing a complaint may impact your career. I 
want to assure you that any employee can file a complaint without fear of reprisal because I have a zero-
tolerance policy against retaliation. 

Sexual harassment isn’t limited to just making inappropriate advances. It also includes any unwelcome verbal or 
physical behavior that creates a hostile work environment whether it occurs inside or outside the workplace or 
through social media platforms. No one should be subjected to any such behavior by anyone you may come into 
contact with as part of your job, including managers, co-workers, contractors or Agency partners.  

When allegations of this type are brought to the Agency’s attention, I can assure you that they will be 
investigated promptly, and upon conclusion, appropriate action will be taken. As mentioned in Monday’s 
message, my leadership team is establishing an Office of Professional Responsibility to ensure expeditious, fair, 
and objective follow-up and resolution of allegations of misconduct.   

The attached documents will answer questions about the steps to report harassment claims.  There is also useful 
information on reporting an incident to the Anti-Harassment Unit.  Counseling services and health and wellness 
advisors are available to all FEMA employees who may not have received the support they needed in the past. 

As I’ve said before, everyone in this Agency is responsible for creating a culture of trust, mutual respect, and 
dignity in our treatment of employees and for all of those we serve. I will accept nothing less.   

129

 
 
It’s important to note that the few individuals participating in this behavior by no means define the majority of 
the honorable, well-intentioned, and well-qualified employees who give this Agency their best every day. I want 
you to know I appreciate your efforts and I will always support and defend you. 

130
