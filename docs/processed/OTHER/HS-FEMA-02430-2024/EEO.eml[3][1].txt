January 2, 2024: Submission of RAR for contnued remote work arrangements.

This Reasonable accommodation request (RAR), fled on 01/02/2024.  A
response was initiated, after I requested assistance from leadership, on
07/10/2024.  That is 190 days after filing the request.  Previously fled
RAR’s are represented below.  137 days should be added to each of the dates
below.  The remaining RAR, those not deleted along with the medical
records, have been open as follows: RAR0046767 has been open for 190 days
before any action,
RAR0042452 has been open for 707 days, RAR0023278 has been open for 985
days and RAR0023261 has been open an astonishing 986 days.
