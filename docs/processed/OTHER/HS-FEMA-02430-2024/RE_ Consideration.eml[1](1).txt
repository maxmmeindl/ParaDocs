I can't afford anymore unpaid time off Rick.
I had over 700 hours off unpaid last year and we're still reeling from
that.
I have to get additional information from my doctor, per EEO, and get it
submitted and then I'm supposed to meet with my supervisor of record to
discuss the RA.

Max,

I understand, I am approving leave at the moment for your FMLA related
reasons. Put your leave in the system and it will be approved. Your RA
request is being processed no determination has been made at this time.
I plan to further engage you in the interactive active aspect of the
accommodation process when I have obtained guidance.

Please understand that we are sensitive to your concerns and request. I do
not want you to be exposed in any manner or take any risk.  Therefore I am
encouraging you to immediately submit leave, and allow me up to 15 days to
work with you and other agency offices to make an informed decision
regarding the Reasonable Accommodations aspect of this matter.

If you have any questions or need additional information let me know.

Thanks for your help.

Richard,
I appreciate your response.
As I stated, I am concerned about potential/possible exposure to
individuals sneezing and coughing at work.
I have a compromised immune system from the medical recovery issues I have
and that were addressed.
With my current chronic conditions and the challenges they present, both
respiratory and circulatory, I am apprehensive, especially with the
unknowns associated with the new virus.
The RA request was for permission to tele-work as required for a possible
period of 2-6 weeks to avoid any potential exposures.
CDC is advising seniors to avoid community based setting if possible
because we are the population at risk.
I have my masks, gloves, etc. and I'm trying hard to protect myself but I
just wanted to formalize an understanding that if things turn south here
in Houston with the Coronavirus, I have an approved option to keep working
because I really can't afford any more unpaid time off, last year was very
costly to me and my family in terms of lost income.

Subject: RE: Consideration

Good Morning Max,

The purpose of this email is to acknowledge your request. Your request for
reasonable accommodation has been reviewed and found that it does specific
your disabling condition. I am not clear about the impact on your major
life activities. Therefore I will liberally approve leave for this purpose
as FMLA for this reason. Additionally, I am requesting guidance from the
Office of Equal Rights, Reasonable Accommodations Team. These are special
times so I want to ensure every measure required of me is taken.

Currently, I will approve your FMLA related leave for this reason, and
once I have guidance from the Office of Equal Rights I will respond to
your request for accommodations.
I want to stress that if you are not feeling well I support you taking
leave. We are not in the posture at this point of everyone staying home.
We will on a case by case base give consideration to employees working
from home if the nature of the work they perform can be supported by
telework. Please continue to take all practical preventive measures such
as washing your hands, limit physical contact and communicate any needs
you have in this regard.

You have my support, please be flexible with me as I seek guidance
regarding this matter. Again, if you need leave I am more than willing to
approve in the interim.
I plan to respond to you regarding this matter within 15 calendar days of
this email.

If you have any questions or need additional information let me know.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Consideration

Rick,
I am concerned about exposure to sneezing and coughing here at work and
was considering requesting a short term (2-6 weeks) reasonable
accommodation to medical-telework while this virus makes its way through
the population.
With a weakened immune system, heart issues and respiratory issues (COPD)
and using inhalers, needless to say, I am way beyond concerned.
I don't want to seem like a scare monger or get on leaderships bad boy
list for requesting an RA, so I don't know what to do at this time.
I am very concerned.
Please advise soonest.

When considering the escalating issue with the Corona Virus, I found this
information from a CDC presentation yesterday:

Transcript for the CDC Telebriefing Update on COVID-19
Press Briefing Transcript
Tuesday, March 3, 2020

While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a
report out of China suggest serious illness occurs in 16% of cases.
Older people and people with underlying health conditions, like heart
disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, were about twice as
likely to develop serious outcomes versus otherwise younger, healthier
people.
We are particularly concerned about these people given the growing number
of cases in the United States as well as those with suspected community
spread.
There are a spectrum of actions that can reduce spread and impact.
These are science-based and come from our play book on mitigating disease
impact.
I want to stress the personal action that individuals can take.
Each year we recommend people wash their hands, cover their cough and
sneezes and stay away from people who are sick.
This is the other side of not spreading the disease, which is not catching
it.  Think twice before you expose yourself to someone who is showing
symptoms.
This is especially important for people who are older and have underlying
health conditions.  For seniors, preparedness may also mean making sure
you have adequate supplies of routine medications, like medication for
blood pressure and diabetes.  This is always part of what CDC recommends
for preparedness.
If you're 65 and older and particularly if you live in areas where there's
on going community spread, you need to think about what actions you can
take to reduce your exposure.

From CDC Alert:
What May Happen

More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days,
including more cases in the United States.
It's also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur,
including in communities in the United States.
It's likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the
United States will occur.
Widespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of
people needing medical care at the same time.
Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass
gatherings may experience more absenteeism.

Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated
rates of hospitalizations and deaths.
Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical
services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care
providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed.
