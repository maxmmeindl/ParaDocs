Reasonable Accommodation Request

Importance:

Hello Max, 

I have received your 256 Reasonable Accommodation Request Form. In addition, we will need supporting 
documentation from your health care provider (on letterhead) to provide to Office of Equal Rights. Below is 
the information that should be included in the letter for a reasonable accommodation request: 

  The nature, severity, or duration of your impairment/disability 
  The extent to which the impairment/disability limits your ability to perform your job 
  Why you require the particular Reasonable Accommodation (what tools do you need to do your job 

i.e. chair, vehicle upgrade / please be very specific) 

  How the accommodation you requested will assist you in performing the essential functions of the job 

Please give me a call, so we can discuss.

I have received your 256 Reasonable Accommodation Request Form. In addition, we will need supporting 
documentation from your health care provider (on letterhead) to provide to Office of Equal Rights. Below is 
the information that should be included in the letter for a reasonable accommodation request: 

  The nature, severity, or duration of your impairment/disability 
  The extent to which the impairment/disability limits your ability to perform your job 
  Why you require the particular Reasonable Accommodation (what tools do you need to do your job 

i.e. chair, vehicle upgrade / please be very specific) 

  How the accommodation you requested will assist you in performing the essential functions of the job 

Please give me a call, so we can discuss. 

Thank you,

I have to meet with a cardiologist to obtain requested paperwork. 
The VA does not seem to be interested in putting anything in writing so I am having to see a provider outside the VA system.

RA Request
RA INFORMATION SHEET-Vista.doc; blank FEMA Form 256-0-1.pdf

My name is Winston Brathwaite. I am a Reasonable Accommodation Analyst in the Office of Equal Rights. It has come to my 
attention that you may have recently applied for a reasonable accommodation. If that is the case, I will be the analyst assigned 
to your case. I have attached to this email for your convenience the RA information sheet, and a blank FEMA 256 Form. Once I 
have received these 2 completed forms, I will begin to expeditiously process your request.  

The reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not be shared with anyone that does not 
have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR) no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to 
preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA).  The 
request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form 
(Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for 
the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an 
RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s 
request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to 
support the specific need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed.  The RA Analysts in the Office of Equal Rights (OER) RA Unit assist/facilitate the process.  As the 
RA Analyst for this case, I  will provide advice regarding the law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the 
language of the response to the RA, if needed. If you need further assistance, or have any questions, please let me know.

Subject: RA Request 

Greetings, Mr. Meindl: 

My name is Winston Brathwaite. I am a Reasonable Accommodation Analyst in the Office of Equal Rights. It has come to my 
attention that you may have recently applied for a reasonable accommodation. If that is the case, I will be the analyst assigned 
to your case. I have attached to this email for your convenience the RA information sheet, and a blank FEMA 256 Form. Once I 
have received these 2 completed forms, I will begin to expeditiously process your request.  

The reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not be shared with anyone that does not 
have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR) no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to 
preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA).  The 
request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form 
(Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for 
the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an 
RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s 

44

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to 
support the specific need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed.  The RA Analysts in the Office of Equal Rights (OER) RA Unit assist/facilitate the process.  As the 
RA Analyst for this case, I  will provide advice regarding the law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the 
language of the response to the RA, if needed. If you need further assistance, or have any questions, please let me know.  

Respectfully,

have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR) no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to 
preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA).  The 
request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form 
(Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for 
the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an 
RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s 
request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to 
support the specific need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed.  The RA Analysts in the Office of Equal Rights (OER) RA Unit assist/facilitate the process.  As the

RE: RA Request

Winston, 
I was just advised by my TFL (Detra Terry) that you were going to be closing my RA request and that I could open a new case. 
That is not acceptable to me. 
I filed my initial RA on AUGUST 23rd 2018 and here we are on November 7th , 2018 with no resolution nor response. 
I find that a tad unacceptable and would like to inquire as to why my request cannot be handled in a timely manner, approved or 
denied. 
According to policy: 
FEMA Manual 1430.1 Chg.1 December 3, 2002 
4-4 
Chapter 5 
Time Frames 
5-1. Processing Requests. FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations, where they are appropriate, 
in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. FEMA recognizes, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the 
nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information. Time frames for processing requests and 
providing reasonable accommodation where no supporting information is required are as follows: 
a. Requests from applicants for employment should be expedited when necessary to ensure the applicant’s ability to compete for the position. 
However, these requests should not exceed ten (10) business days. 
b. If a request from an employee is processed by the supervisor, the request should be processed, and the accommodation, if granted, provided 
within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the request. Requests for accommodation should be expedited when the accommodation is 
needed to enable the employee to participate in an Agency activity scheduled to occur in the near future. 
(1) If the decision maker believes that it is necessary to obtain medical information to determine whether the requesting individual has a 
disability and/or to identify the functional limitations, the decision maker will request the information as soon as possible after his or her receipt 
of the request for accommodation. FEMA recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive 
process has begun. 
(2) In cases where medical documentation is needed, the accommodation, if granted, will be provided within ten (10) business days for an

Greetings, Mr. Meindl: 

My name is Winston Brathwaite. I am a Reasonable Accommodation Analyst in the Office of Equal Rights. It has come to my 
attention that you may have recently applied for a reasonable accommodation. If that is the case, I will be the analyst assigned 
to your case. I have attached to this email for your convenience the RA information sheet, and a blank FEMA 256 Form. Once I 
have received these 2 completed forms, I will begin to expeditiously process your request.  

The reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not be shared with anyone that does not 
have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR) no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to 
preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA).  The 
request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form 
(Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for 
the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an 
RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s 
request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to 
support the specific need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed.  The RA Analysts in the Office of Equal Rights (OER) RA Unit assist/facilitate the process.  As the 
RA Analyst for this case, I  will provide advice regarding the law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the 
language of the response to the RA, if needed. If you need further assistance, or have any questions, please let me know.

Please see the email string below. Supervisors of Record have 30 days within which to render a decision on a reasonable 
accommodation request. As you mentioned in your email to me, your request was submitted in August. It is now going on 
almost 120 days with no decision rendered. We cannot allow this case to languish any further. If the SOR is prepared to render a

RE: RA Request

I spoke with you several weeks ago and discussed that we received your RA Request Form, but no 
healthcare documentation. At that time, you said you would need to meet with a cardiologist to obtain 
requested paperwork. We are more than happy to assist you with the process. Will you be able to provide 
documentation shortly? Would you like to have another discussion as to what is required in the physician’s 
note? I believe you are requesting a reasonable accommodation to telework. Have you spoke with field 
leadership and Equal Rights to see if they can accommodate this request and work from an alternative 
location?

Subject: RE: RA Request 

Winston, 
I was just advised by my TFL (Detra Terry) that you were going to be closing my RA request and that I could open a new case. 
That is not acceptable to me. 
I filed my initial RA on AUGUST 23rd 2018 and here we are on November 7th , 2018 with no resolution nor response. 
I find that a tad unacceptable and would like to inquire as to why my request cannot be handled in a timely manner, approved or 
denied. 
According to policy: 
FEMA Manual 1430.1 Chg.1 December 3, 2002 
4-4 
Chapter 5 
Time Frames 
5-1. Processing Requests. FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations, where they are appropriate, 
in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. FEMA recognizes, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the 
nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information. Time frames for processing requests and 
providing reasonable accommodation where no supporting information is required are as follows: 
a. Requests from applicants for employment should be expedited when necessary to ensure the applicant’s ability to compete for the position. 
However, these requests should not exceed ten (10) business days. 

84

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. If a request from an employee is processed by the supervisor, the request should be processed, and the accommodation, if granted, provided 
within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the request. Requests for accommodation should be expedited when the accommodation is 
needed to enable the employee to participate in an Agency activity scheduled to occur in the near future. 
(1) If the decision maker believes that it is necessary to obtain medical information to determine whether the requesting individual has a 
disability and/or to identify the functional limitations, the decision maker will request the information as soon as possible after his or her receipt 
of the request for accommodation. FEMA recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive 
process has begun. 
(2) In cases where medical documentation is needed, the accommodation, if granted, will be provided within ten (10) business days for an 
applicant, and within 15 business days for an employee, from the date the decision maker receives the relevant information, absent any 
extenuating circumstances. 
c. Where the Disability Program Manager is the decision maker on a request for reasonable accommodation, he/she will make a decision on the 
request and the  accommodation, if granted, will be provided within 15 business days from the date of the request. If medical documentation is 
necessary, the decision will be made within 15 business days of receipt of the medical information, absent any extenuating circumstances. 

All requested appropriate documentation has been provided as requested including my doctors statement.

Subject: RA Request 

Greetings, Mr. Meindl: 

My name is Winston Brathwaite. I am a Reasonable Accommodation Analyst in the Office of Equal Rights. It has come to my 
attention that you may have recently applied for a reasonable accommodation. If that is the case, I will be the analyst assigned 
to your case. I have attached to this email for your convenience the RA information sheet, and a blank FEMA 256 Form. Once I 
have received these 2 completed forms, I will begin to expeditiously process your request.  

The reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not be shared with anyone that does not 
have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR) no other individual should be included or copied in the process, to 
preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a reasonable accommodation (RA).  The 
request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form 
(Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are requesting as an accommodation, the reason for 
the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and date the request.  When an individual requests an 
RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and the employee to better understand the employee’s 
request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to 
support the specific need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed.  The RA Analysts in the Office of Equal Rights (OER) RA Unit assist/facilitate the process.  As the 
RA Analyst for this case, I  will provide advice regarding the law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the 
language of the response to the RA, if needed. If you need further assistance, or have any questions, please let me know.

Greetings, Mr. Meindl: 

Please see the email string below. Supervisors of Record have 30 days within which to render a decision on a reasonable 
accommodation request. As you mentioned in your email to me, your request was submitted in August. It is now going on 
almost 120 days with no decision rendered. We cannot allow this case to languish any further. If the SOR is prepared to render a 
decision the case can be processed and closed. If not, the case will be closed until the SOR is prepared to render a decision. I 
hope this helps.

RA Request

(005).pdf; blank FEMA Form 256-0-1.pdf

It was a pleasure to talk to you on the phone. Per our conversation, Mr. Max Meindl has filed a request for a reasonable 
accommodation. I am the Reasonable Accommodation Analyst assigned to the case and will be working with you on the request. 
If you are not familiar with the process, the reasonable accommodation (RA) request process is a confidential one that must not 
be shared with anyone that does not have a need to know.  Besides the supervisor of record (SOR), no other individual should be 
included or copied in the process, to preserve confidentiality.  The RA process starts with the request of the employee for a 
reasonable accommodation (RA), attached.  The request can be done in any way, verbally, email, letter, etc. The SOR should 
request that the employee fill out a 256-0-1 form (Request for Reasonable Accommodation), attached, indicating what they are 
requesting as an accommodation, the reason for the request and if the request is time sensitive.  The employee must sign and 
date the request.  When an individual requests an RA, there should be an interactive process (meeting) between the SOR and 
the employee to better understand the employee’s request and needs.  If the disability is not obvious (visible), or the SOR is not 
familiar with the employee’s circumstances, the SOR requests the employee to provide medical documentation to support the 
need for the RA requested.  Sufficient medical information provides the following information: 

•             Nature, severity and duration of the disability 
•             What major life activity or activities the disability impairs  
•             How the impairment of the major life activity or activities affects the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position  
•             Limitations that the disability imposes on the individual as related to the performance of the essential functions of the 
individual’s position 
•             How the RA requested will assist the employee in the performance of the essential functions of the position  

Since the medical provider may not be familiar with the essential functions of the employee’s position, here is some guidance to 
be applied in making the decision, regarding how essential functions are determined, as outlined in FEMA’s RA policy: 

Essential functions are “those job duties so fundamental to the position that the individual holds or desires that he/she cannot 
do the job without performing them. A function can be “essential” if, among other things, the position exists specifically to 
perform that function; there are a limited number of other employees who could perform the function; and/or the function is 
highly specialized and the individual is hired based on his/her expertise or ability to perform it. Determination of the essential 
functions of a position must be done on a case-by-case basis so that it reflects the job as actually performed, and not simply the 
components of a generic position description.” 

In FEMA, the supervisor of record (SOR) is the individual that makes the decision of approving, denying or granting an alternate 
RA, after having an interactive discussion with the employee.  OER staff can participate as facilitators, or neutral parties in the 
interactive discussion, if needed. OER’s role is to assist managers with the timely processing of reasonable accommodation 
requests consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA RA Policy.  A supervisor has 30 days to 
make a decision on the employee’s request.  As the RA Analyst assigned to this case, I will provide advice to you regarding the 
law, the policy and procedure and can provide assistance with the language of the response to the RA, if needed. I have also 
attached Mr. Meindl’s RA information sheet for you. Please also note that page 2 of the 256 Form must be filled out by you, with 
block 2 indicating whether the request is granted, and block 16 providing an explanation for what is being granted, and for what 
period of time. I have attached a blank 256 Form so that you can complete and return page 2 of it to me. I have also attached 
the medical documentation provided by Mr. Meindl’s health care provider. Because it includes pii, I have password protected it. 
The password will be sent to you in a separate email. If you have any questions, or need any assistance, please let me know. I 
look forward to working with you.

December 12th, 2018 
On or about August 13th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.  As of this 
date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.  Although the RA request has passed through many 
hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen it important enough to respond to my RA 
request.  When considering that over four (4) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy 
governing this specific RA request has not been complied with.  I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be 
provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.  I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as 
required by policy.  Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?  All 
requested and required information has been provided per policy and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. 
As a veteran and senior citizen with a documented disability in my files, it is incumbent upon someone to step forward and 
address this egregious oversight/situation soonest.

I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?

Subject: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

To whom it may concern, 
December 12th, 2018 
On or about August 23th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.   
As of this date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.   
Although the RA request has passed through many hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen 
it important enough to respond to my RA request.   
When considering that nearly four (4) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy 
governing this specific RA request has not been complied with.   
I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?   
All requested and required information has been provided per policy to Winston D. Brathwaite, J.D., Affirmative Employment 
Specialist | AEP/RA| DHS/FEMA/Office of Equal Rights | 500 C Street SW, 4SW-0809, Washington, DC 20472-3505 | Desk:

please feel free to contact me.  
As a veteran and senior citizen with a documented disability in my files, it is incumbent upon someone to step forward and 
address this egregious oversight/situation soonest.

Subject: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

To whom it may concern, 
December 12th, 2018 
On or about August 23th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.   
As of this date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.   
Although the RA request has passed through many hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen 
it important enough to respond to my RA request.   
When considering that nearly four (4) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy 
governing this specific RA request has not been complied with.   
I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?   
All requested and required information has been provided per policy to Winston D. Brathwaite, J.D., Affirmative Employment 
Specialist | AEP/RA| DHS/FEMA/Office of Equal Rights | 500 C Street SW, 4SW-0809, Washington, DC 20472-3505 | Desk:

please feel free to contact me.  
As a veteran and senior citizen with a documented disability in my files, it is incumbent upon someone to step forward and 
address this egregious oversight/situation soonest.

Ok. The point of the RA is to assist you in doing your job. So, I apologize if you were not informed, or it was not put in place for 
you. I am sure there is a simple solution to this. Something may have just fallen through the cracks. As soon as I hear something, 
I will reach out to you and let you know.

To whom it may concern, 
December 12th, 2018 
On or about August 23th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.   
As of this date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.   
Although the RA request has passed through many hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen 
it important enough to respond to my RA request.   
When considering that nearly four (4) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy 
governing this specific RA request has not been complied with.   
I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?   
All requested and required information has been provided per policy to Winston D. Brathwaite, J.D., Affirmative Employment

RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request 

Nicole, 
As of this date I’ve yet to receive an answer to my RA request filed in August of 2018.   
I am at a loss trying to understand how FEMA/DHS policy can be so blatantly ignored/violated in such a casual manner by so many. 
My request was based on a serious heart condition requiring a bit of flexibility in my morning schedule to accommodate issues I 
face daily.   
My heart surgery, which was scheduled for 01/25/2019, had to be postponed/rescheduled for a different time, but I am hoping it 
will be soon.   
My simple request to FEMA/DHS was for some understanding and flexibility to assist me over the past 6 months, in a challenging 
time, and the FEMA team, thus far, has deemed me insignificant and not worthy of a response nor consideration of assistance. 
Can you explain this? 

NOTE: Equal Rights Office policy requires the agency to provide requested Reasonable Accommodation within 10 days, barring 
extenuating circumstances.

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

Nicole, 
As of this date I’ve yet to receive an answer to my RA request filed in August of 2018.   
I am at a loss trying to understand how FEMA/DHS policy can be so blatantly ignored/violated in such a casual manner by so many. 
My request was based on a serious heart condition requiring a bit of flexibility in my morning schedule to accommodate issues I 
face daily.   

187

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
My heart surgery, which was scheduled for 01/25/2019, had to be postponed/rescheduled for a different time, but I am hoping it 
will be soon.   
My simple request to FEMA/DHS was for some understanding and flexibility to assist me over the past 6 months, in a challenging 
time, and the FEMA team, thus far, has deemed me insignificant and not worthy of a response nor consideration of assistance. 
Can you explain this? 

NOTE: Equal Rights Office policy requires the agency to provide requested Reasonable Accommodation within 10 days, barring 
extenuating circumstances.

RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request 

Nicole, 
Why is the RA process so ignored/abused by the process? 
I’ve done everything required on my end yet the “institution” can’t seem to take the request seriously nor process the request 
pursuant to DHS/FEMA policy. 
This seems unjust, unfair and unreasonable to an individual requesting/requiring a timely response to a request. 
Instead of a reasonable accommodation, so I can be allowed to do a couple of hours of telework before driving 60 miles to the 
office, I am required to take “leave without pay” on a regular basis resulting in a diminished paycheck.   
All in all, it seems as if the default position of DHS/FEMA is to stall and/or decline any request, for whatever reason. 
I would expect or request that the process, mine specifically, be looked in to, and to identify process disconnects and put eyes on 
a way to improve the process, especially the timeliness requirements or lack thereof 
According to policy: 
FEMA Manual 1430.1 Chg.1 December 3, 2002 
4-4 
Chapter 5 
Time Frames 
5-1. Processing Requests. FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations, where they are appropriate, 
in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. FEMA recognizes, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the 
nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information. Time frames for processing requests and 
providing reasonable accommodation where no supporting information is required are as follows: 
a. Requests from applicants for employment should be expedited when necessary to ensure the applicant’s ability to compete for the position. 
However, these requests should not exceed ten (10) business days. 
b. If a request from an employee is processed by the supervisor, the request should be processed, and the accommodation, if granted, provided 
within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the request. Requests for accommodation should be expedited when the accommodation is 
needed to enable the employee to participate in an Agency activity scheduled to occur in the near future. 
(1) If the decision maker believes that it is necessary to obtain medical information to determine whether the requesting individual has a 
disability and/or to identify the functional limitations, the decision maker will request the information as soon as possible after his or her receipt 
of the request for accommodation. FEMA recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive 
process has begun. 
(2) In cases where medical documentation is needed, the accommodation, if granted, will be provided within ten (10) business days for an 
applicant, and within 15 business days for an employee, from the date the decision maker receives the relevant information, absent any 
extenuating circumstances. 
c. Where the Disability Program Manager is the decision maker on a request for reasonable accommodation, he/she will make a decision on the 
request and the  accommodation, if granted, will be provided within 15 business days from the date of the request. If medical documentation is 
necessary, the decision will be made within 15 business days of receipt of the medical information, absent any extenuating circumstances. 

We are going on 132 business days since AUGUST 23rd 2018 and 196 calendar days. 
Unreasonable and unnecessary.

Subject: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

To whom it may concern, 
December 12th, 2018 
On or about August 23th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.   
As of this date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.   
Although the RA request has passed through many hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen 
it important enough to respond to my RA request.   
When considering that nearly four (4) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy 
governing this specific RA request has not been complied with.   
I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?   
All requested and required information has been provided per policy to Winston D. Brathwaite, J.D., Affirmative Employment 
Specialist | AEP/RA| DHS/FEMA/Office of Equal Rights | 500 C Street SW, 4SW-0809, Washington, DC 20472-3505 | Desk:

please feel free to contact me.  
As a veteran and senior citizen with a documented disability in my files, it is incumbent upon someone to step forward and 
address this egregious oversight/situation soonest.

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

Nicole, 
Why is the RA process so ignored/abused by the process? 
I’ve done everything required on my end yet the “institution” can’t seem to take the request seriously nor process the request 
pursuant to DHS/FEMA policy. 
This seems unjust, unfair and unreasonable to an individual requesting/requiring a timely response to a request. 
Instead of a reasonable accommodation, so I can be allowed to do a couple of hours of telework before driving 60 miles to the 
office, I am required to take “leave without pay” on a regular basis resulting in a diminished paycheck.   
All in all, it seems as if the default position of DHS/FEMA is to stall and/or decline any request, for whatever reason. 
I would expect or request that the process, mine specifically, be looked in to, and to identify process disconnects and put eyes on 
a way to improve the process, especially the timeliness requirements or lack thereof 
According to policy: 
FEMA Manual 1430.1 Chg.1 December 3, 2002 
4-4 
Chapter 5 
Time Frames 
5-1. Processing Requests. FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations, where they are appropriate, 
in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. FEMA recognizes, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the 
nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information. Time frames for processing requests and 
providing reasonable accommodation where no supporting information is required are as follows: 
a. Requests from applicants for employment should be expedited when necessary to ensure the applicant’s ability to compete for the position. 
However, these requests should not exceed ten (10) business days. 
b. If a request from an employee is processed by the supervisor, the request should be processed, and the accommodation, if granted, provided 
within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the request. Requests for accommodation should be expedited when the accommodation is 
needed to enable the employee to participate in an Agency activity scheduled to occur in the near future. 
(1) If the decision maker believes that it is necessary to obtain medical information to determine whether the requesting individual has a 
disability and/or to identify the functional limitations, the decision maker will request the information as soon as possible after his or her receipt 
of the request for accommodation. FEMA recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive 
process has begun. 
(2) In cases where medical documentation is needed, the accommodation, if granted, will be provided within ten (10) business days for an 
applicant, and within 15 business days for an employee, from the date the decision maker receives the relevant information, absent any 
extenuating circumstances. 
c. Where the Disability Program Manager is the decision maker on a request for reasonable accommodation, he/she will make a decision on the 
request and the  accommodation, if granted, will be provided within 15 business days from the date of the request. If medical documentation is 
necessary, the decision will be made within 15 business days of receipt of the medical information, absent any extenuating circumstances. 

We are going on 132 business days since AUGUST 23rd 2018 and 196 calendar days.

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

Nicole, 
As of this date I’ve yet to receive an answer to my RA request filed in August of 2018.   
I am at a loss trying to understand how FEMA/DHS policy can be so blatantly ignored/violated in such a casual manner by so many. 
My request was based on a serious heart condition requiring a bit of flexibility in my morning schedule to accommodate issues I 
face daily.   
My heart surgery, which was scheduled for 01/25/2019, had to be postponed/rescheduled for a different time, but I am hoping it 
will be soon.   
My simple request to FEMA/DHS was for some understanding and flexibility to assist me over the past 6 months, in a challenging 
time, and the FEMA team, thus far, has deemed me insignificant and not worthy of a response nor consideration of assistance. 
Can you explain this? 

NOTE: Equal Rights Office policy requires the agency to provide requested Reasonable Accommodation within 10 days, barring 
extenuating circumstances.

RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request 

No, I specifically requested “Tele-work option when not feeling well” which is typically a couple of hours in the mornings  until my 
heart levels out and/or quits threatening me, (that’s a joke), but depending on many variables, weather, ability to sleep, ability to 
lie down or not.  I need to sit and meditate or do breathing exercises, but for sure I’m not ready to get in a car and drive 60 miles 
in Houston traffic.  BUT, I am able to log in and answer emails, make telephone calls, work in Grants Manager on behalf of my 
applicants.  When all levels out, I get in the car and head to the office to finish my day.  I am a producer and take care of my 
applicants to the point of when management wanted to transfer an applicant to another PDMG they received a letter from the 
applicants congressman stipulating disagreement with that decision.  Lo and behold I was reassigned the applicant.  I do my job, I 
do it well and I was just wanting some accommodation.

Nicole, 
Why is the RA process so ignored/abused by the process? 

207

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I’ve done everything required on my end yet the “institution” can’t seem to take the request seriously nor process the request 
pursuant to DHS/FEMA policy. 
This seems unjust, unfair and unreasonable to an individual requesting/requiring a timely response to a request. 
Instead of a reasonable accommodation, so I can be allowed to do a couple of hours of telework before driving 60 miles to the 
office, I am required to take “leave without pay” on a regular basis resulting in a diminished paycheck.   
All in all, it seems as if the default position of DHS/FEMA is to stall and/or decline any request, for whatever reason. 
I would expect or request that the process, mine specifically, be looked in to, and to identify process disconnects and put eyes on 
a way to improve the process, especially the timeliness requirements or lack thereof 
According to policy: 
FEMA Manual 1430.1 Chg.1 December 3, 2002 
4-4 
Chapter 5 
Time Frames 
5-1. Processing Requests. FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation and provide accommodations, where they are appropriate, 
in as short a time frame as reasonably possible. FEMA recognizes, however, that the time necessary to process a request will depend on the 
nature of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary to obtain supporting information. Time frames for processing requests and 
providing reasonable accommodation where no supporting information is required are as follows: 
a. Requests from applicants for employment should be expedited when necessary to ensure the applicant’s ability to compete for the position. 
However, these requests should not exceed ten (10) business days. 
b. If a request from an employee is processed by the supervisor, the request should be processed, and the accommodation, if granted, provided 
within 15 business days from the date of receipt of the request. Requests for accommodation should be expedited when the accommodation is 
needed to enable the employee to participate in an Agency activity scheduled to occur in the near future. 
(1) If the decision maker believes that it is necessary to obtain medical information to determine whether the requesting individual has a 
disability and/or to identify the functional limitations, the decision maker will request the information as soon as possible after his or her receipt 
of the request for accommodation. FEMA recognizes that the need for documentation may not become apparent until after the interactive 
process has begun. 
(2) In cases where medical documentation is needed, the accommodation, if granted, will be provided within ten (10) business days for an 
applicant, and within 15 business days for an employee, from the date the decision maker receives the relevant information, absent any 
extenuating circumstances. 
c. Where the Disability Program Manager is the decision maker on a request for reasonable accommodation, he/she will make a decision on the 
request and the  accommodation, if granted, will be provided within 15 business days from the date of the request. If medical documentation is 
necessary, the decision will be made within 15 business days of receipt of the medical information, absent any extenuating circumstances. 

We are going on 132 business days since AUGUST 23rd 2018 and 196 calendar days. 
Unreasonable and unnecessary.

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

Nicole, 
As of this date I’ve yet to receive an answer to my RA request filed in August of 2018.   
I am at a loss trying to understand how FEMA/DHS policy can be so blatantly ignored/violated in such a casual manner by so many. 
My request was based on a serious heart condition requiring a bit of flexibility in my morning schedule to accommodate issues I 
face daily.   
My heart surgery, which was scheduled for 01/25/2019, had to be postponed/rescheduled for a different time, but I am hoping it 
will be soon.   
My simple request to FEMA/DHS was for some understanding and flexibility to assist me over the past 6 months, in a challenging 
time, and the FEMA team, thus far, has deemed me insignificant and not worthy of a response nor consideration of assistance. 
Can you explain this? 

NOTE: Equal Rights Office policy requires the agency to provide requested Reasonable Accommodation within 10 days, barring 
extenuating circumstances.

We are going on 132 business days since AUGUST 23rd 2018 and 196 calendar days. 
Unreasonable and unnecessary.

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request  

Nicole, 
As of this date I’ve yet to receive an answer to my RA request filed in August of 2018.   
I am at a loss trying to understand how FEMA/DHS policy can be so blatantly ignored/violated in such a casual manner by so many. 
My request was based on a serious heart condition requiring a bit of flexibility in my morning schedule to accommodate issues I 
face daily.   
My heart surgery, which was scheduled for 01/25/2019, had to be postponed/rescheduled for a different time, but I am hoping it 
will be soon.   
My simple request to FEMA/DHS was for some understanding and flexibility to assist me over the past 6 months, in a challenging 
time, and the FEMA team, thus far, has deemed me insignificant and not worthy of a response nor consideration of assistance. 
Can you explain this? 

NOTE: Equal Rights Office policy requires the agency to provide requested Reasonable Accommodation within 10 days, barring 
extenuating circumstances.

To whom it may concern, 
Feb 12th 2019 
On or about August 27th, 2018, I submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) request for consideration/processing.   
As of this date, I’ve received no answer, up or down, concerning my request.   
Although the RA request has passed through many hands/personnel from Washington D/C. to Houston to Austin, no one has seen 
it important enough to respond to my RA request.   
When considering that nearly SIX (6) months have passed since my initial RA request, it would be safe to say that policy governing 
this specific RA request has not been complied with.   
I am respectfully requesting that a response to my RA request be provided forthwith as required by FEMA policy.   
I am at a loss in trying to understand the lack of response, in a timely manner, as required by policy.   
Would someone, willing to take ownership, please respond to the RA on file since August 13th, 2018?   
All requested and required information has been provided per policy to Winston D. Brathwaite, J.D., Affirmative Employment 
Specialist | AEP/RA| DHS/FEMA/Office of Equal Rights | 500 C Street SW, 4SW-0809, Washington, DC 20472-3505 | Desk:

please feel free to contact me.  
As a veteran and senior citizen with a documented disability in my files, it is incumbent upon someone to step forward and 
address this egregious oversight/situation soonest.
