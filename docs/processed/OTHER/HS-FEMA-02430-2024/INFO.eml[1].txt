CAD, HTN, HLD s/p cardiac surgery in 04,2019,

Cardiology studies:
March 2019 TTE LVEF 55-60, impaired relaxation, borderline LVH
Native Vessels
--------------
Summary: 2 vessel CAD
Dominance: Right dominant
Narrative Description:
LM: No angiographic CAD
LAD: 80% proximal stenosis prior to large D1. Almost is a bifid system
Previous distal stent with ISR and CTO after stent ends
Small channel which provides trickle of blood flow
LCx: Luminal irregularities
RCA: Patent prior stent. 70% distal rPL stenosis
A/P:
Mr. Meindl is a 69 years old with obesity, CAD s/p PCI to LAD
(08/2009), RCA (05/2013), PCI to LAD CTO 4/2019, HTN, HLD, and chronic
leukocytosis who presents for telephonic follow up visit.
# CAD s/p PCI to LAD (8/09), and RCA (5/13) s/p PCI to mid-LAD CTO with DES
(4/19)
- CCS 1
- continue DAPT as long as he can tolerate, considering stent anatomy.
- Continue lipitor 80 daily
