Good afternoon,  

The FMLA update process being applied in this situation is consistent with policy. Your approved FMLA condition of 
record is the matter being addressed as it relates to the updates being requested. You have said in your response that 
you are not scheduled to see the physician until next year and that you will request an appointment and attempt to get 
one as soon as possible. I will follow up with you in seven (7) days to see if you were able to get an appointment for this 
matter.  

In the meantime I will recommend to your supervisor to continue to approve your current FMLA request for the said 
condition until you have an appointment scheduled. The specifics of the concerns is that your current FMLA is approved 
for 1-3 occurrences every month and you have exceeded the frequency so your management is attempting to obtain 
updated information.  

Thanks for your cooperation with this matter. Please let me know if you have additional questions or concerns.

JG, 
My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose, throat) group at the DeBakey VA hospital to 
attempt to ascertain the source for my recurring dizzy spells. 
My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020. 
My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is also 
next year. 
I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient clinic, but I’m not sure if that can happen within 15 
days, it is the VA, so nothing is for certain. 
I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private physician in Bellville. 
I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has identified, in the onboarding process, as an individual 
with a disability and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent associated health issues, I am 
concerned about the way the institution and/or individuals within the institution, treat those identified as disabled, more 
specifically, myself.   
If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn’t and I don’t understand.   
It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my opinion. 
I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my recovery but, I must admit that it has been an 
extremely distasteful experience with other FEMA personnel. 

I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am concerned about the 15 day window.

Subject: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl 

Good afternoon Max,  

On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a serious/chronic health condition.  Given that it has now 
been more than thirty (30) calendar days since your last medical update for your current FMLA condition, I am requesting 
that you provide me with an FMLA recertification as it relates to your current FMLA condition of record.  The 
recertification is now necessary to ensure that the workload on your team can be planned and managed effectively while 
assisting you during your time of recovery.  Therefore, I am requesting that you work with your physician to respond to 
all questions where appropriate especially those related to the questions identified below. These questions are not separate 
and apart from the recertification form but can be responded to within the context of the questions already provided on the 
form.  (29 CFR 825.308(a), permits recertification every 30 days for chronic or permanent/long-term conditions.)   

Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update: 

  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the specific condition listed on your FMLA application dated 
and signed by your physician, on 4/11/2019.       

  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your condition & if you will be incapacitated for a single 
continuous period of time.  (See questions #1 & #4). 

  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned appointments within the next 30 days. (See 
Question #5) 

  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, 
including any time for recovery.  (See Question #6) 

  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will have flare-ups during your recovery period (if 
known) that will prevent you from performing your job functions. (See question #7). 

Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My goal remains to work cooperatively with 
you and your physician in a manner which affords you the best opportunity to recover and return to full time employment 
status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA Recertification information within fifteen (15) working days of 
receipt will result in the denial of any FMLA related leave until the information is provided.  

If you experience difficulty providing this information within the specified period, please see me, or in my absence 
Patricia David, and provide a brief written statement documenting your hardship and your request for extension will be 
responded to within three (3) working days.

On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a serious/chronic health condition.  Given that it has now 
been more than thirty (30) calendar days since your last medical update for your current FMLA condition, I am requesting 
that you provide me with an FMLA recertification as it relates to your current FMLA condition of record.  The 
recertification is now necessary to ensure that the workload on your team can be planned and managed effectively while 
assisting you during your time of recovery.  Therefore, I am requesting that you work with your physician to respond to 
all questions where appropriate especially those related to the questions identified below. These questions are not separate 
and apart from the recertification form but can be responded to within the context of the questions already provided on the 
form.  (29 CFR 825.308(a), permits recertification every 30 days for chronic or permanent/long-term conditions.)   

Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update: 

12

 
 
 
   
 
 
  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the specific condition listed on your FMLA application dated 
and signed by your physician, on 4/11/2019.       

  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your condition & if you will be incapacitated for a single 
continuous period of time.  (See questions #1 & #4). 

  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned appointments within the next 30 days. (See 
Question #5) 

  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, 
including any time for recovery.  (See Question #6) 

  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will have flare-ups during your recovery period (if 
known) that will prevent you from performing your job functions. (See question #7). 

Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My goal remains to work cooperatively with 
you and your physician in a manner which affords you the best opportunity to recover and return to full time employment 
status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA Recertification information within fifteen (15) working days of 
receipt will result in the denial of any FMLA related leave until the information is provided.  

If you experience difficulty providing this information within the specified period, please see me, or in my absence 
Patricia David, and provide a brief written statement documenting your hardship and your request for extension will be 
responded to within three (3) working days.

RE: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl

JG, 
My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose, throat) group at the DeBakey VA hospital to 
attempt to ascertain the source for my recurring dizzy spells. 
My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020. 
My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is also 
next year. 
I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient clinic, but I’m not sure if that can happen within 15 
days, it is the VA, so nothing is for certain. 
I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private physician in Bellville. 
I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has identified, in the onboarding process, as an individual 
with a disability and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent associated health issues, I am 
concerned about the way the institution and/or individuals within the institution, treat those identified as disabled, more 
specifically, myself.   
If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn’t and I don’t understand.   
It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my opinion. 
I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my recovery but, I must admit that it has been an 
extremely distasteful experience with other FEMA personnel. 

I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am concerned about the 15 day window. 

Please advise.

Good Morning Max, 

Very glad to meet you yesterday. The performance comments provided by Detra have been uploaded into FedHR under 
your case #248282 and I have also attached them. I believe that I have resolved the issue of the reviews being locked. 
HR sometimes locks the forms while they are working on them, and it’s not uncommon to have this issue. Please go 
ahead and sign Quarter 2 and Quarter 3.  

Quarter 2 documents in FEDHR were your Individual Development Plan that you had previously signed and a PDF of the 
performance goals.

I am willing and we owe Karen an answer. I know she needs to report the progress on the mediation and I informed her 
that we were meeting last week. If we need to copy the lady she identified for immediate assistance we need to copy 
her on any communications with Karen. I am available today to discuss. You can call me on my cell.

From the Sit With Guidance document: 
PAGS Sit-With Guidance 
What is a sit-with? 
A sit-with is a one-on-one feedback coaching session between a manager and staff.  Staff will  
participate in an initial sit-with with their manager, during which they will discuss their previous disaster roles, particular 
technical specialties and skill sets. This discussion will inform leadership on the level of complexity for a staff’s assignment.

Please note that a sit-with is a one-on-one meeting and all of these alleged “sit-withs” were group hugs without the 
benefit of the hug, more like a ganging up on the new guy.

From the Sit With Guidance document: 
PAGS Sit-With Guidance 
What is a sit-with? 
A sit-with is a one-on-one feedback coaching session between a manager and staff.  Staff will  
participate in an initial sit-with with their manager, during which they will discuss their previous disaster roles, particular 
technical specialties and skill sets. This discussion will inform leadership on the level of complexity for a staff’s assignment. 

Please note that a sit-with is a one-on-one meeting and all of these alleged “sit-withs” were group hugs without the 
benefit of the hug, more like a ganging up on the new guy.

To whom it may concern, 
I find the letter closing this complaint of harassment specious and inaccurate at best. 
The statement that an investigation was conducted and “witness statement” and/or “evidence collected” led to 
allegations being unsubstantiated, is interesting at a minimum. 
Pursuant to the attachment in this email and a copy of a previously sent email, sent to, what I assume to be the primary 
investigator, stipulated in no uncertain terms that there were no witnesses to the alleged harassment and that the 
harassment was my perception of an escalation or a previous meeting wherein I had been inappropriately accused and 
unprofessionally addressed in front of other parties. 
The harassment claim has to do with my perception of the escalation only, no witnesses involved. 

Below is a copy of the email stipulating my concerns when I filed the complaint:

Subject: cover email 
I am, after a couple of weeks of considerable handwringing and possible/potential blowback considerations, hereby submitting the 
attached complaint, although I am very concerned about retaliation. 
I have been falsely accused, in my opinion, and it appears the parties involved are escalating the issue to the possible detriment of my 
employment. 
I categorically deny the allegations and assertions as put forth. 
I have had a very successful tenure with FEMA since 09/2017 when deployed to the Beaumont East team. 
I was a high producer of “applicant signed projects” and continue to do the same here as demonstrated in the Grants Manager 
Metrics. 
I never had any problem with “communications” until all of the sudden I can’t seem to do anything correct in my current deployment 
here in Houston. 
I am dismayed with the process and attitude of the parties, the guilty until proven innocent prevailing mindset is inherently unfair. 
A sit-with summary by TK Shadowens before my meeting with the DPAG could best described as “Fiction” because we never discussed 
the items in his summary report and I advised he and DPAG of the same. 
Show me a specific example of the alleged “communication” or “body language” issue.   
I have been falsely accused and convicted without any consideration for my perspective or statements to clarify. 
I am submitting this to you as HR in confidence and would like to request a contact to the EEO group so I can file with them also 
because I feel this issue revolves around my disability and needs to be addressed. 
I would also request a contact to ADR so I can pursue that avenue as well. 
Please contact me with any questions, guidance, advice if required. 
Please advise soonest. 

Thank you in advance.
