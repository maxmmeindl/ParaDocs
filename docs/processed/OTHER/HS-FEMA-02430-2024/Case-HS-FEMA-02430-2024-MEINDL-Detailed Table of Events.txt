Detailed Table of Events, Dates, Names, Policy/Statute/Law Violations, and Quotes for EEO Investigation
This table consolidates critical events, dates, involved individuals, associated policy/statute/law violations, and direct quotes or statements from emails or Teams messages, based on provided documents, including RA communications, FMLA determination, rebuttals to witness affidavits, prior analyses, the comprehensive response detailing FEMA Region 6's systemic failures. Max J. Meindl case HS-FEMA-02430-2024, it addresses FEMA’s mishandling of Reasonable Accommodation (RA) requests, retaliatory termination on January 6, 2025, and broader inability to accommodate older employees. Each entry includes evidence, identifies responsible parties, cites violations of federal laws, EEOC Management Directive 110 (MD-110), FEMA policies, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and provides relevant quotes where available from emails or Teams messages. Where no direct quotes are available (e.g., due to lack of specific message content in the provided documents), the column notes the absence or references the document source.
Notes on Violations, Evidence, and Quotes:
Rehabilitation Act §501 (29 C.F.R. §1630): Requires individualized accommodation assessments and prohibits disability discrimination. FEMA’s failure to explore virtual deployments and termination without exhausting accommodations violate this statute.
HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR §164.312): Mandates secure PHI transmission. Unencrypted emails by Clemons breached Meindl’s privacy, exacerbating stress for an older employee.
EEOC MD-110: Guidelines for EEO processes. Violations include untimely processing (§IV.D), undocumented interactive processes (§VI.A), redundant documentation requests (§VI.C), inadequate investigation (§VI), and ignored retaliation indicators (§XI).
FEMA Instruction 256-022-01: Sets 45-day RA processing timeline, consistently exceeded (e.g., 194 days for RAR0046767, 986 days for RAR0023261).
FEMA Manual 123-13-1: Requires 30-day advance notice, progressive discipline, and Douglas Factors for adverse actions. Termination notice lacks these elements.
FEMA Directive 123-0-2-1: Mandates employee welfare checks post-disaster. Failure to conduct a call-down after Hurricane Beryl neglected Meindl’s well-being.
ADEA (29 U.S.C. §623): Prohibits age discrimination. FEMA’s disparate treatment, systemic delays, and welfare neglect suggest age bias, per Smith v. City of Jackson (544 U.S. 228).
OMB M-17-06: Governs feedback protocols; premature OAST surveys violate resolution-based feedback requirements.
Quotes/Statements: Quotes are included where specific email or Teams message content is provided in the documents. Where unavailable, the absence is noted, and the source document is referenced. Some quotes are paraphrased for brevity while preserving intent, as exact message content may be summarized in sources like PERPLEXITY SUMMARY-APRIL 2025.docx.
Evidence Sources: Emails (EMAIL EXPORT-04-25-25.CSV, fmla determination-alexander.pdf, ra request-comms-rick-pag.pdf, ra comms-rick-pag-3.pdf), rebuttals (A Rebuttal to Affidavits of Witnesses.pdf), analyses (GROK CHAT SUMMARY FOR FINALIZATION.docx, PERPLEXITY SUMMARY-APRIL 2025.docx), and comprehensive response (Comprehensive Response in Support of Max J. Meindl’s EEO Complaint).

Assess age-based disparate treatment by comparing accommodations for younger vs. older employees.
Investigate lack of call-down post-Hurricane Beryl, per FEMA Directive 123-0-2-1.
Examine premature OAST surveys for procedural irregularities.
This table provides a comprehensive, evidence-based chronology with direct quotes to support Meindl’s EEO complaint, highlighting FEMA Region 6’s violations and systemic issues affecting older employees.
