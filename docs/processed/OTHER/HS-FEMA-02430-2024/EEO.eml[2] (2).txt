Max:

I did not bill you for any of the preparation or sending the formal
complaint or associated communications with FEMA reps regarding
that matter. But I have resumed billing for the ADR/Mediation communication
and scheduling, and will include time for participation at the mediation
and the associated calls.

Thank you,
Brent
