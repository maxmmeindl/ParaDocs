Ms. Cooley,

Thank you so very much for the clarification.

I hope to have the recertification done this week or early next week,
based upon current medical issues/assessments although, I have been
scheduled for additional CAT scans and associated testing.

The scope of the medical issues is evolving but I very much appreciate
having a workload that keeps me busy and distracted from my physical
issues, although my morning startup is a bit challenging.

I try to be here by 8:30 - 09:00 and work until 4:30 or 5:30 to ensure I
get my full 8 hours in.

This year, with all of the unpaid leave, has put a definite stress on the
family and the finances.

I appreciate you kind and detailed response to my concerns.

Max,



Thank you for reaching out. I want you to know that your Supervisor, Tim
Wick is working hard to ensure he takes care of and supports all of his
employees. At this Tim is only attempting to ensure that you have a
updated FMLA in place nothing more. Next he will reassess the workload of
all staff performing the same work and each person is contributing  to the
workload in a manner consistent with the requirements of their assigned
position. He will make the necessary adjustments to ensure the workload is
properly distributed in a manner which provides equity to his employees
and efficiency of support to customers. Any employee carrying too much
will have the work reduced and any employee not carrying enough will have
the work increased. Employees who need FMLA or Reasonable Accommodations
will be supported without exception. However this does not mean that we
will reduce the quantity or quality of the work to be performed. Employees
who need to take leave will be required to manage their workload and not
allow their absences to impact their customers or put a burden on their
co-workers to cover for them. Tim's approach of each employee being held
accountable to perform the work assigned is a little different than his
previously approach. In the past Tim when employees called in at the last
minute he assigned others to cover for them in the new approach he will
assign others to cover and then have the absent employee cover for the
other employee to keep the workload distributed equally. This approach is
not designed to make anyone feel singled out but rather to create a work
environment where the expectation is that each employee contributes toward
the mission consistent in regards to quality and quantity of work
performed.



Please be patient as we go through this process of supporting Tim and
other TRO Supervisors who have been so driven from a JFO perspective to
just get the work done that as we shift to more of a fix cite operational
posture we have to also foster a work environment which supports high
performing teams where everyone contributes with or without an
accommodation or FMLA.



I hope this email helps to clarify your understanding.

Ms. Cooley,

I am forwarding this email to you for information purposes.

I have no problem doing the FMLA recertification, subject to the time
issues and making appointments.

What concerns me is that I feel as if I have been singled out for special
attention.

The who of that issue is subject to a bit of detective work but I know who
has questioned me in the past.

If I wasn't doing my job, that would be one thing but I am doing it and I
do it well.

If you have any insight or words of encouragement.. send them on.



Be well.

JG,

My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose,
throat) group at the DeBakey VA hospital to attempt to ascertain the
source for my recurring dizzy spells.

My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020.

My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is also next year.

I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient
clinic, but I'm not sure if that can happen within 15 days, it is the VA,
so nothing is for certain.

I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private
physician in Bellville.

I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has
identified, in the onboarding process, as an individual with a disability
and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent
associated health issues, I am concerned about the way the institution
and/or individuals within the institution, treat those identified as
disabled, more specifically, myself.

If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn't and I don't
understand.

It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my
opinion.

I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my
recovery but, I must admit that it has been an extremely distasteful
experience with other FEMA personnel.



I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am
concerned about the 15 day window.



Please advise.

Subject: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl



Good afternoon Max,

On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a
serious/chronic health condition.  Given that it has now been more than
thirty (30) calendar days since your last medical update for your current
FMLA condition, I am requesting that you provide me with an FMLA
recertification as it relates to your current FMLA condition of record.
The recertification is now necessary to ensure that the workload on your
team can be planned and managed effectively while assisting you during
your time of recovery.  Therefore, I am requesting that you work with your
physician to respond to all questions where appropriate especially those
related to the questions identified below. These questions are not
separate and apart from the recertification form but can be responded to
within the context of the questions already provided on the form.  (29 CFR
825.308(a), permits recertification every 30 days for chronic or
permanent/long-term conditions.)

Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update:

  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the
specific condition listed on your FMLA application dated and signed by
your physician, on 4/11/2019.

  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your
condition & if you will be incapacitated for a single continuous period of
time.  (See questions #1 & #4).

  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned
appointments within the next 30 days. (See Question #5)

  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on
an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, including any time for
recovery.  (See Question #6)

  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will
have flare-ups during your recovery period (if known) that will prevent
you from performing your job functions. (See question #7).

Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My
goal remains to work cooperatively with you and your physician in a manner
which affords you the best opportunity to recover and return to full time
employment status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA
Recertification information within fifteen (15) working days of receipt
will result in the denial of any FMLA related leave until the information
is provided.

If you experience difficulty providing this information within the
specified period, please see me, or in my absence Patricia David, and
provide a brief written statement documenting your hardship and your
request for extension will be responded to within three (3) working days.

Regards,
