Decision on Request for Reasonable Accommodation

Re: 

Reasonable Accommodation (RA) Request – RAR0046767 

Background 

On January 2, 2024, you requested a reasonable accommodation of “remote/virtual/teleworking.” 
At that time and currently, your position was as a Direct Charge Core (DCC), Emergency 
Management Specialist (Recovery). After receiving your request for reasonable accommodation, 
an RA Specialist was assigned on or about June 12, 2024. We engaged with you in interactive 
discussions with the guidance of an RA Specialist on the following dates: July 10, 11, 12, 24, 
and 31; August 5.  

Decision 

From January 2024 until August 2024, before the denial of your accommodation request, I, 
Anthony In, as your First Line Supervisor of Record (SOR) worked to ensure your safety by 
providing 100% telework and marking you as unavailable for deployment in the DTS system, as 
necessary. 

During your onboarding, I engaged in interactive discussions with you, asking for more detailed 
information about your limitations and reminding you of your responsibility to physically 
deploy, as it is a key essential function of the job. 

In January 2024, I acknowledged your medical issues and reminded you of your obligations to be 
deployed but marked you unavailable in the DTS system while we continued to discuss your 
status and when you would be able to return to regular duties. 

In May 2024, I continued having interactive discussions with you to remind you of your 
obligations to deploy. You advised that you had a pending accommodation, and I continued to 

1 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
support by providing telework and alternative work assignments while a final determination had 
been reached. 

On August 5, 2024, I, your First Line Supervisor of Record, denied your request for 
virtual/remote/telework as it would require the agency to remove the following essential 
functions of your position as a DCC, Emergency Management Specialist (Recovery):  

•  That you serve as a front-line employee and the primary point of contact and interface 

with the public for technical support, program delivery, and advise of grant 
opportunities.  

•  That you must be ready to deploy physically anywhere in the United States or its 

territories at any time on a 24-hour notice. 

•  That frequent Temporary Duty (TDY) travel is required. 
•  That you are assigned to an emergency team designed to perform essential functions 
during an actual or impending crisis or declared national emergency, subject to recall 
during non-duty hours in the event of emergencies.   

•  That you are required by emergency assignment to be available to report to an 

emergency duty station during duty and non-duty hours by the fastest means available 
and be prepared to operate at the emergency duty station for an indefinite period. 
•  That deployments include working more than eight (8) hours a day or more than forty 

(40) hours per week, including weekends and holidays. 

•  Specifically, your Position Description states as a Condition of Employment that 

“The work is normally performed in an office setting. However, this position requires 
that the incumbent train, maintain a state of readiness, and be deployed into the 
possible high-risk environment of a disaster site. Conditions in some disaster 
environments may include irregular diet or rations; limited rest; uncomfortable 
sleeping conditions; extensive overtime; an environment with unsanitary conditions; 
and related risks, such as reoccurrence of the disaster event (e.g., general hazards, or 
additional flooding). Travel may be required on short notice, during poor conditions. 
Extreme caution must be exercised to assure personal safety, as well as safety of co-
workers and members of the public who look to the employee for guidance.” 

Following this decision, you submitted a request for appeal to your Second Line Supervisor of 
Record, Jodi Hunter. 

On August 15, 2024, your Second Line Supervisor of record denied your request for non-
deployment citing the forgoing essential functions required for job performance. In addition, Ms. 
Hunter cited that Max’s “acknowledgment that he cannot leave his house to deploy under any 
circumstances contributes to my decision.  Finally, his branch (Infrastructure Branch, Recovery 
Division) supports disaster deployments on an almost daily basis.  His temporary 
accommodation cannot continue as assignments of duties are totally unrelated to his current 
position of record and cannot be continued.”  

On August 26, 2024, you informed the Office of Civil Rights of your desire to enter the 
reassignment process as an accommodation of last resort to an equivalent, vacant, funded 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
position. On October 30, 2024, the Talent Recruitment & Acquisition Division informed you 
there are no vacant positions which could serve as an accommodation of last resort. 

As is readily apparent from a review of the above-noted essential job functions, your position is 
not suitable for non-deployment and/or telework. That is because there are a substantial number 
of essential job tasks that require your ability to travel and to deploy to disaster events. We 
determined that, based on all the information known to us after conducting an individualized 
assessment of the relevant circumstances, including the essential functions of the specific job and 
the requested accommodation(s), that the accommodation requested would have required the 
agency to lower performance standards, production standards, or otherwise fundamentally 
change the nature of the position. The Rehabilitation Act does not require that FEMA modify or 
eliminate essential functions of a job to provide an accommodation. As such, FEMA has 
exhausted all efforts to accommodate you through the reasonable accommodation process and 
will proceed with a final denial.  

Right to Equal Employment Opportunity 

If you believe that this denial constitutes unlawful discrimination and wish to file an Equal 
Employment Opportunity Complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614, contact an EEO Counselor in 
the Office of Civil Rights by emailing FEMA-OCR-EEO@fema.dhs.gov or calling 202-212-
3535 within 45 days from the date of this denial of reasonable accommodation or 45 days from 
the date you became aware of the action.

Subject: Max Meindl Reasonable Accommodation Request

Good Afternoon –

I have been tasked with verifying accountability for all staff scheduled to be in office on their designated days for the Houston office. I
understand there is a pending Reasonable Accommodation request for Max. Below is an outline of the steps necessary to determine next
action items for Max in the process re: his selected days in office for the Houston campus, as advised through discussion with Mission Support.

When did employee initiate the Reasonable Accommodation request? Determine how long he has been out of the office.

Identify employee’s RA specialist (person tasked with his RA request since beginning process) and reach out to them about the pending
request. If specific person cannot be located then email stated inquiries to the Reasonable Accommodations mailbox.

Inquire where in the process the request is. What items, documents, or other necessary items are necessary to complete the process
for request to be satisfied.  

Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%? If so, was it a 90 day approval? Dates needed to
show when approval was recorded. (Depending on length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable accommodation request
might not be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

I am attempting to answer some of Max’s questions on next steps he needs to take and identify how the request can be settled through the
proper guidelines we were given. If further clarification is needed please reach out to Karina Aguilo from Mission Support to advise.  

Thank you,

Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

Good morning, Max,

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential
functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%),
management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in
the attached 256-02 form.

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position,
consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation. 
Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be
able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to
deploy. 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

Respectfully,
Anna Myers

Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  It is understood that Mr. Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is 
close to his home; however, I cannot consider that in a decision to grant the request.  The option presented by Mr. Meindl is not a viable solution as I cannot

QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY,
PLACE OF WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS
UNLAWFUL
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees
on the basis of their sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an
unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any
individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual’s race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S.
768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as
well as belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections
also extend nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death.
See EEOC, Questions and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title
VII’s protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation
because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that
include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong
which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.’ Although courts generally
resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not
protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns ‘ultimate ideas’
about ‘life, purpose, and death’”).

As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical,
consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd.
of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S.
707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized
religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s sincerely held religious beliefs, it
is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989)
(“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a specific
tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely
held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held
religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.”
(emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. Supp.
2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,”
“not just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law provides protection for sincerely held
religious beliefs even when some members of the same religious organization, sect, or denomination
disagree with the beliefs espoused by the individual. That some individuals may have sincerely held
religious beliefs which differ from those sincerely held by the employees requesting accommodation
is irrelevant to whether the employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to protection
under Title VII.

 
Department of Health, in its handout literature for those considering one of the COVID-19 vaccines,
notes the following: “The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson did
require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the
vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 2021), 
https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana
Department of Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the
PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.”
La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21,
2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-
19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna
and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of Health’s publications again
confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of the development
of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology,
fetal cells were used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and
produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D.
Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are
developed and produced from, tested with, researched on, or otherwise connected with the aborted
fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs compel them to
abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their bodies, regardless of the
perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and other adherents
whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the three
currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any
employee is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many
indisputably do. Many employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the
womb and knows them prior to their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment
of conception to natural death. See Psalm 139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you
knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”);
Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one
of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.”); Isaiah 44:2
(“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus says the
Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah
49:5 (“And now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5
(“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I
appointed you a prophet to the nations”).

As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical,
consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd.
of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.
City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence
to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t

protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a
particular religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v.
Voices in theWilderness, 329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides
protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” “not just tenets of organized religion”).
The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the Currently Available COVID-19
Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this section, the Secretary
(of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into interstate
commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec
t2i6o nofa 6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA
Statute]. As an essential part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates
that all individuals to whom the EUA product may be administered be given the option to accept or
refuse administration of the product. See 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that
“individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . of the option to accept or refuse
administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available COVID-19 vaccines
(Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use under the
EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact
Sheets for each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to
accept or receive the vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24,
2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive
the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard
medical care.” (emphasis added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June
25, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to
receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change
your standard medical care.” (emphasis added)); Janssen, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers
(July 8, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to
receive the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your
standard medical care.” (emphasis added)).

I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the
currently available alleged
COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His
Commandments, for which I would be held
morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a religious
accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s),
that will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse
employment action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs.

HEART CONDITION

Home /  Disabilities

A to Z: Heart Condition

About Heart Condition

The term “heart condition” includes conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, congestive heart

failure, and congenital cardiovascular impairments. Each type of heart condition has its own symptoms, which may include

angina (chest pain sometimes radiating down the left arm or into the jaw); sensations of  uttering, thumping, pounding, or

racing of the heart (palpitations); edema (swelling and  uid retention in the legs, ankles, abdomen, lungs, or heart);

lightheadedness, weakness, dizziness, or fainting spells; breathlessness; chronic fatigue; and gastric upset (or nausea).

Heart Condition and the Americans with Disabilities Act

The ADA does not contain a de nitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA de nes a

person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more

"major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more

information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a

Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

Accommodating Employees with Heart Condition

People with heart conditions may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the

degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with heart conditions will need

accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a

sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.

Questions to Consider:

1.  What limitations is the employee experiencing?

2.  How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?

3.  What speci c job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?

4.  What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used

to determine possible accommodations?

5.  Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of

the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?

6.  Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

Key Accommodations

Decreased Stamina/Fatigue: Individuals with heart conditions can become fatigued to the extent they can’t work a full shift

or perform the physical aspects of their jobs.

Allow work from home
Allow  exible scheduling and  exible leave
Implement ergonomic considerations

Eliminate physical exertion
Permit a service animal for mobility assistance

Dizziness: Individuals with heart conditions may experience dizziness or lightheadedness when standing up quickly,

standing in place for prolonged periods, or from prolonged walking.

Provide chairs with armrests and locking casters so that individuals can steady themselves when standing up without
worry that the chair will move
Provide stools or chairs to allow for alternating between standing and sitting

Allow additional rest breaks or modify when tasks are done to break up periods of prolonged walking

Gross Motor: Individuals with heart conditions may experience short- or long-term gross motor limitations.

Implement ergonomic considerations

Provide equipment, e.g., lifting devices, carts, stand/lean stools

Permit the use of mobility aids and/or service animal

Fine Motor: Individuals with heart conditions may have  ne motor limitations stemming from conditions such as a stroke.

Provide speech recognition software and/or alternative mice

Provide ergonomic tools and/or tool balancers

Provide grip aids and/or reachers

Effect of/ Receive Medical Treatment: Individuals with heart conditions may need time to attend medical appointments or

recover from medical treatment or procedures.

Allow the employee to work from home

Allow  exible scheduling and  exible leave

be granted competitive eligibility to apply for permanent full-time positions at FEMA. 

FEMA is committed to ensuring that its workforce reflects the diversity of the nation.  At FEMA, our workforce includes the 
many identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, ages, cultures, and beliefs of the people we serve. To learn about FEMA's

This authorization is issued by FEMA’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) pursuant to 29 CFR  
§ 1614.108. It authorizes the aforementioned EEO Investigator to investigate the complaint of 
discrimination identified above. In accordance with 29 CFR § 1614.108, the EEO Investigator is 
authorized to: 

• 

• 

investigate all aspects of the complaint of discrimination, as defined in and limited to 
those issues identified in the Letter of Acceptance, to include a request to produce all 
records deemed by the EEO Investigator to be pertinent to the investigation. 
Documents should be produced within 5 calendar days from the date of the 
request; 

require all agency personnel having relevant knowledge of the allegations to 
cooperate with the investigation and to furnish testimony. Cooperation includes 
timely response to request for interviews; timely production of documents; and timely 
return of signed affidavits. EEO Investigators will promptly notify the agency of 
any instances of non-compliance; 

•  administer oaths and require that the statements of witnesses be executed under oath 

or affirmation, without a pledge of confidentiality; 

•  ensure that third-party information, not relevant to the accepted claims, is sanitized 

prior to its inclusion into the Report of Investigation; and 

• 

recommend to the Agency that an adverse inference may be drawn when the 
Complainant or Agency employees fail, without a showing of good cause, to respond

separate document and encrypt or password-protect it before transmitting via email. Send the 
password-protected document as an email attachment and provide the password to the EEO 
Investigator via separate transmission (e.g., via separate email). 

If an EEO Investigator sends you documents containing PII or sensitive information via email 
without password protection, you must immediately report it to the assigned Case Manager or 
OCR’s EEO Internal Civil Rights Director, Andrew Peck, as appropriate, who in turn will report it 
to the FEMA Privacy Office.

allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest  witnesses to  be interviewed by the investigator.   However, the investigator will decide

a.  The policy cited for my termination does not align with the legal requirement under 

the Rehabilitation Act to provide accommodations on an individual basis, not through 
blanket policies.

seems retaliatory. 

c.  In the informal communication with FEMA before this filing, I was told by their 
legal counsel that they had a policy that would not allow for remote work.  

d.  This did not address the need for remote work to be an accommodation, as it should 
be made on an individual basis and not a blanket policy. This also did not address 
my clear ability to complete my job while working fully remote for the previous 
four years.  

43. Who notified you of your termination? 

a.  Anthony In 

44. Was this notification done verbally or in writing?

I HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING: 

I have an obligation to cooperate fully with the investigator, who has been assigned to conduct a 
thorough and impartial investigation of my complaint of discrimination.  Therefore, I must provide 
a statement for the investigative record which is true and complete to the best of my knowledge 
and belief and which fully addresses the issues accepted for investigation.  My statement must be 
specific with regard to names, dates, places, circumstances, and related events, and disclose my 
firsthand knowledge of any information which is directly related to the issue(s).  My statement, 
along with my Informal Complaint, Counselor's Summary Report, my Formal Complaint and the 
description of the issues for investigation shall serve as the basis for the investigation.   While I 
may  voluntarily  submit  any  additional  documents  or  information  to  the  investigator  for 
consideration, it will be the investigator's responsibility to determine what evidence shall actually 
become part of the investigative report.  If there are any documents or facts which substantiate my 
allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest  witnesses to  be interviewed by the investigator.   However, the investigator will decide 
which witnesses to interview based on relevant information he or she feels will be furnished. 

I am aware of and my understanding of the protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
which are pertinent to my claims. 

My  statement  is  made  under  oath  (or  affirmation)  without  a  pledge  of  confidentiality;  in 
accordance  with  the  rules,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  This means that any employee(s) 
whom I accuse of discrimination or other acts of impropriety may be shown relevant portions of 
this statement and be given an opportunity to respond.  Agency officials responsible for processing 
complaints of discrimination will have access to the entire investigative report.  If discrimination 
is found, any employee accused of discrimination will have an opportunity to review the report in

protected  by  law  and  the  EEO  regulations  from  any  acts  of  reprisal,  discrimination,  coercion, 
harassment, restraint, or interference for their participation in the investigation and other phases of 
complaint processing.  

I have the right to be represented by a person of my choice during presentation of complaint and 
preparation of my statement (so long as my choice does not result in a conflict of interest).  I have 
chosen a personal representative at this stage of my complaint.  In the event I have not chosen a 
representative  but  obtain  a  representative  at  a  later  date,  I  will  advise  the  investigator  and  the 
Director of Civil Rights in writing. 

I have the right to review my statement prior to signing it and may make initialed corrections if it 
is  incomplete  or  inaccurate.  I  have  a  right  to  receive  a  copy  of  the  signed  statement.    Having 
reviewed the preceding information with the investigator, I solemnly swear [ ] affirm [ ] that the

a)  My reasonable accommodation requests was/were ignored, this specific RA for more 

than 190 days. When I finally pressed the issue to be resolved with higher authorities I 
was terminated., Age: I was bypassed for promotions and training opportunities that were

accommodations were consistently delayed or denied, unlike those of non-disabled peers. 

b)  RA (Reasonable Accommodation) requests were ignored for years (see image), and this 

directly relates to my disability under the Rehabilitation Act. My request(s) for 

accommodation was ignored for over 190 days and more, violating Section 501 of the 

Rehabilitation Act which mandates timely reasonable accommodations for qualified 

individuals with disabilities.

Act."

Whether Complainant, Emergency Management Specialist, (Applicant), of Bellville, TX 
was discriminated against based on disability (physical) and age (1951) by management 
when the following incidents occurred:   

II.  1. On August 16, 2024, Complainant’s Reasonable Accommodation request was denied. 
29. Specifically, who denied your RA request? What reason was given for the denial? What did 
you request? Please explain. Did you inform anyone in management that you were offended 
by this? If so, what response did you receive. 

a.  Anthony In 

b.  The first denial was 08/05/24 and stipulated “Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable 

accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  It is understood that Mr. 
Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is close to his home; however, I cannot 
consider that in a decision to grant the request.  The option presented by Mr. Meindl 
is not a viable solution as I cannot grant him the ability to limit his deployment 
location.  Given that Mr. Meindl would need to be sent wherever the disaster is 
located and his inabilities to do would limit my ability, therefore, I must deny his 
request. 

c.  The second denial, Jodie Hunter, dated 08/15/2024, stipulated; “After careful 

consideration, Mr. Max Meindl’s request to telework 100% of the time is denied.  
The approval to allow Mr. Meindl to telework 100% of the time would require that 
the Agency remove the essential function of deployment from his duties and 
responsibilities.  Mr. Meindl signed his onboarding, acknowledging that his position 
required that he deploy.  While I understand that Mr. Meindl has a disability; 
however, his acknowledgment that he cannot leave his house to deploy under any 
circumstances contributes to my decision.  Finally, his branch (Infrastructure Branch, 
Recovery Division) supports disaster deployments on an almost daily basis.  His 
temporary accommodation cannot continue as assignments of duties are totally 
unrelated to his current position of record and cannot be continued.” 

30. How were you harmed? 

a.  Physically, I experienced increased discomfort; professionally, I was sidelined, which 

affected my career progression and self-esteem. 

b.  Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.  
c.  “The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, 

where applicable:” 

d.  Why the requested accommodation would not be effective; 
e.   Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the Agency; 
f.  Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that the 

individual has a disability and/or needs a reasonable accommodation.

my physical disability, protected under the Rehabilitation Act.  

d.  The isolation and lack of work assignments indicate discrimination based on these

34. Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of physical disability? 

a.  The denial of accommodations and the dismissive attitude towards my needs indicate 

discrimination based on disability.

seems retaliatory. 

c.  In the informal communication with FEMA before this filing, I was told by their

d.  This did not address the need for remote work to be an accommodation, as it should

I HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING: 

I have an obligation to cooperate fully with the investigator, who has been assigned to conduct a 
thorough and impartial investigation of my complaint of discrimination.  Therefore, I must provide 
a statement for the investigative record which is true and complete to the best of my knowledge 
and belief and which fully addresses the issues accepted for investigation.  My statement must be 
specific with regard to names, dates, places, circumstances, and related events, and disclose my 
firsthand knowledge of any information which is directly related to the issue(s).  My statement, 
along with my Informal Complaint, Counselor's Summary Report, my Formal Complaint and the 
description of the issues for investigation shall serve as the basis for the investigation.   While I 
may  voluntarily  submit  any  additional  documents  or  information  to  the  investigator  for 
consideration, it will be the investigator's responsibility to determine what evidence shall actually 
become part of the investigative report.  If there are any documents or facts which substantiate my 
allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest  witnesses to  be interviewed by the investigator.   However, the investigator will decide 
which witnesses to interview based on relevant information he or she feels will be furnished. 

I am aware of and my understanding of the protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
which are pertinent to my claims. 

My  statement  is  made  under  oath  (or  affirmation)  without  a  pledge  of  confidentiality;  in 
accordance  with  the  rules,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  This means that any employee(s) 
whom I accuse of discrimination or other acts of impropriety may be shown relevant portions of 
this statement and be given an opportunity to respond.  Agency officials responsible for processing 
complaints of discrimination will have access to the entire investigative report.  If discrimination 
is found, any employee accused of discrimination will have an opportunity to review the report in

protected  by  law  and  the  EEO  regulations  from  any  acts  of  reprisal,  discrimination,  coercion, 
harassment, restraint, or interference for their participation in the investigation and other phases of 
complaint processing.  

I have the right to be represented by a person of my choice during presentation of complaint and 
preparation of my statement (so long as my choice does not result in a conflict of interest).  I have 
chosen a personal representative at this stage of my complaint.  In the event I have not chosen a 
representative  but  obtain  a  representative  at  a  later  date,  I  will  advise  the  investigator  and  the 
Director of Civil Rights in writing. 

I have the right to review my statement prior to signing it and may make initialed corrections if it

a)  My reasonable accommodation requests was/were ignored, this specific RA for more 

than 190 days. When I finally pressed the issue to be resolved with higher authorities I 
was terminated., Age: I was bypassed for promotions and training opportunities that were

b)  RA (Reasonable Accommodation) requests were ignored for years (see image), and this 

directly relates to my disability under the Rehabilitation Act. My request(s) for

II.  1. On August 16, 2024, Complainant’s Reasonable Accommodation request was denied. 
29. Specifically, who denied your RA request? What reason was given for the denial? What did 
you request? Please explain. Did you inform anyone in management that you were offended 
by this? If so, what response did you receive. 

a.  Anthony In 

b.  The first denial was 08/05/24 and stipulated “Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable 

accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  It is understood that Mr. 
Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is close to his home; however, I cannot 
consider that in a decision to grant the request.  The option presented by Mr. Meindl 
is not a viable solution as I cannot grant him the ability to limit his deployment 
location.  Given that Mr. Meindl would need to be sent wherever the disaster is 
located and his inabilities to do would limit my ability, therefore, I must deny his 
request. 

c.  The second denial, Jodie Hunter, dated 08/15/2024, stipulated; “After careful 

consideration, Mr. Max Meindl’s request to telework 100% of the time is denied.  
The approval to allow Mr. Meindl to telework 100% of the time would require that 
the Agency remove the essential function of deployment from his duties and 
responsibilities.  Mr. Meindl signed his onboarding, acknowledging that his position 
required that he deploy.  While I understand that Mr. Meindl has a disability; 
however, his acknowledgment that he cannot leave his house to deploy under any 
circumstances contributes to my decision.  Finally, his branch (Infrastructure Branch, 
Recovery Division) supports disaster deployments on an almost daily basis.  His 
temporary accommodation cannot continue as assignments of duties are totally 
unrelated to his current position of record and cannot be continued.” 

d.  Sent to EEO Specialist, Reasonable Accommodation (RA), Disability Support Branch 
| Office of Civil Rights (OCR) on 08/22/24; I do not believe that I am no longer able 
to perform the essential functions of the specified position. I am limited in my ability 
to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues. *This may impact the 
preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense 
of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process. I was blissfully unaware 
that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that 
information being provided during the interview. If you can access the job interview 
transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement. When told that 
information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind 
the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.  The only “interactive process” I 
had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel. This specific RAR 
was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to 
expedited.  This happened after being in the queue for 190 days.  The note to “reply 
no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years 

Initials _____mjm______ 

Page 6 of 17 

 
 
was unacceptable and extremely frustrating.  This RAR sat for months and then gets 
turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, at least from my 
perspective. Ignored, abused, dismissed.  My understanding, at this time, is that the 
“essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.  I can and do provide the 
essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and 
responsibilities. The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 
Primarily due to declining health. For the past few years, a proactive SOR and 
assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that 
enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment. I have been virtually 
deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with 
limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to 
assist practically anywhere). I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 
05/2023-11/2023.  15 months. In office approximation (06/2018-03/2020), 21 
months.  I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the 
appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy. It does not 
impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020. There was a 
short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, with was problematic with a 
medical event being tossed into the mix.  I was under the assumption we were 
exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and 
I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to 
Houston was had on 05/29/24.  When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could 
deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was 
overruled. In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-
utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the 
response was that he was told to stand down on this issue. From my perspective, my 
SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, 
both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was 
overruled. It is unclear to me why it was overruled. I would like to assume it was 
because of a concern over my health. If so, why not a virtual deployment option? I 
have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and 
how I could do more for the mission. I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-
05/2023) as a PDTFL. 

30. How were you harmed? 

a.  Physically, I experienced increased mental discomfort; professionally, I was 

sidelined, which affected my career progression and self-esteem. 

b.  Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.  
c.  “The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, 

where applicable:”

retirement suggest age discrimination. 

c.  I was treated differently because of my age, which is protected under the ADEA, and 

my physical disability, protected under the Rehabilitation Act.  

d.  The isolation and lack of work assignments indicate discrimination based on these

34. Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of physical disability? 

a.  The denial of accommodations and the dismissive attitude towards my needs indicate 

discrimination based on disability.

a.  Documents stated they could not provide reasonable accommodation anywhere 

within the agency that would allow me to continue working with FEMA. 

42.  Do you agree with the reasons given for terminating your employment? Please explain 

a.  The policy cited for my termination does not align with the legal requirement under 

the Rehabilitation Act to provide accommodations on an individual basis, not through 
blanket policies. 

b.  No, my performance evaluations met or exceeded expectations; the sudden change 

seems retaliatory. 

c.  In the informal communication with FEMA before this filing, I was told by their 
legal counsel that they had a policy that would not allow for remote work.  

d.  This did not address the need for remote work to be an accommodation, as it should 

be made on an individual basis and not a blanket policy.  

e.  This also did not address my clear ability to complete my job while working fully 

remote for the previous four years.

discrimination based on my age (73), physical disability, and retaliation.

•  Placement: Denton County – Remote 
•  Agency: DHS/FEMA – Recovery/Public Assistance 
•  Home Address: 5 E. Austin St., Bellville, TX 77418 
•  Supervisors:  

o  First-Line Supervisor: Anthony In (Email: Anthony.in@fema.dhs.gov) 
o  Second-Line Supervisor: Jodi Hunter 
o  Period Under Supervision: Approximately 1 year 

Job Responsibilities 

As a Program Delivery Task Force Leader (PDTFL), my responsibilities included: 

•  Serving as an intermediary between the Public Assistance Group Supervisor (PAGS) and 

Program Delivery Managers (PDMGs). 

•  Communicating Joint Field Office (JFO) operational priorities to PDMGs. 
•  Ensuring workload balance for PDMGs to facilitate efficient customer service to applicants. 
•  Managing and mentoring PDMGs throughout the Public Assistance grant delivery process. 
•  Overseeing workflow and performance within the Infrastructure Branch, Recovery Division. 

During my tenure, I successfully performed these duties remotely for over four years without any 
complaints about my work performance. 

Statement of Understanding 

I acknowledge my obligation to cooperate fully with the investigator assigned to conduct a thorough and 
impartial investigation of my complaint. My statement is made under oath in accordance with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and DHS Civil Rights regulations. I am aware that: 

•  My statement may be shown to the accused individuals, who will have the right to respond. 
•  The agency’s officials responsible for processing complaints will have full access to the 

investigative report. 

•  Any retaliation for participation in the EEO process is strictly prohibited under Title VII of the 

Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 

Claims of Discrimination & Retaliation 

1. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation (August 16, 2024) 

•  Denied Accommodation Request: My request for 100% telework due to my disability was denied. 
•  Denial Rationale Provided by FEMA:  

o  August 5, 2024: Anthony In stated my request was not viable due to my position’s 

deployment requirement. 

Initials _____mjm______ 

Page 14 of 17 

 
 
 
 
o  August 15, 2024: Jodi Hunter reaffirmed the denial, arguing that approving my request 

would require removing an essential function of deployment from my role. 

•  Legal Violations & Discrepancies:  

o  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 501: Requires agencies to provide reasonable 

accommodations unless it creates undue hardship. 

o  My 190+ day wait for adjudication violates EEOC standards for timely accommodation. 
o  My four years of successful remote work proves that physical deployment was not an 

essential function. 

•  Failure to Properly Justify Denial: 
FEMA failed to clearly state:  

o  Why the requested accommodation would not be effective. 
o  Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the agency. 
o  Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that I have a 

disability and need a reasonable accommodation. 

o  Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential 

function. 

o  Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of performance or 

production standards. 

2. Wrongful Termination (January 6, 2025) 

•  Decision Maker: Anthony In 
•  Other Involved Individuals: Jodi Hunter, Don Simko, and FEMA legal counsel 
•  Termination Reason Given:  

o  FEMA stated it could not provide reasonable accommodation anywhere within the 

agency. 

o  No alternative placements were considered despite my experience and qualifications. 

•  Legal Violations & Retaliation Evidence:  

o  Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228 (2005): Established that employment policies can 
be discriminatory under the ADEA based on disparate impact, even without intent. 

o  Retaliation: My termination followed my formal requests for accommodations, 

demonstrating a direct link between my protected activity and adverse action. 

Comparative Disparities 

•  Younger, Non-Disabled Employees:  

o  Received professional development opportunities and promotions. 
o  Were provided flexible work accommodations that I was denied. 

•  Disabled Employees with Different Supervisors:  

o  Were granted telework without excessive scrutiny. 

•  Employees of Other Races:  

o  Had greater access to leadership roles and assignments.

GENERAL:   This form should be used only if you, as an applicant for employment with the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS), or as a present or former Department of Homeland Security employee: 

1.  

believe you have been discriminated against because of your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, 
gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 years or older at the time of the event giving rise 
to your claim), physical or mental disability, genetic information or in reprisal for opposition to activities 
protected by civil rights statutes, or participation in proceedings to enforce those statutes; or

2.  

believe you have been discriminated against because of your parental status. Your claim is not covered under 
statutory basis, but will be processed under a parallel procedure, and

3.  

have presented the matter for informal resolution to an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor giving rise 
to your claim, or when first becoming aware of the alleged discrimination. If you are amending or providing 
additional evidence to an existing open complaint, the form should be used, but EEO counseling is not required.

lieu of an affidavit in the investigation of your complaint. Accordingly, the information you provide in this part should be brief, 
clear, and complete.

date you received the "Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint" from your EEO Counselor. You must sign and date 
your complaint. If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney may sign the complaint on your behalf.  

These time limits may be extended:

if you show that you were not notified of the time limits and were not otherwise aware of them, or

if you were prevented by circumstances beyond your control from submitting the matter within the time limits, or

for other reasons considered sufficient by the Department.

REPRESENTATION:  You may have a representative of your own choosing at all stages of the processing of your 
complaint. However, your representative will be disqualified if such representation would conflict with the official or collateral 
duties of the representative. No EEO Counselor, EEO Investigator or EEO Officer may serve as a representative. (Your 
representative need not be an attorney, but only an attorney representative may sign the complaint on your behalf.)      

WHERE TO FILE:  In accordance with 29 CFR 1614.106(c), your written complaint must be signed by you or your attorney. 
The complaint should be filed with the EEO Director of the Department of Homeland Security component where the alleged

to your claim), physical or mental disability, genetic information or in reprisal for opposition to activities 
protected by civil rights statutes, or participation in proceedings to enforce those statutes; or

2.  

believe you have been discriminated against because of your parental status. Your claim is not covered under 
statutory basis, but will be processed under a parallel procedure, and

3.  

have presented the matter for informal resolution to an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor giving rise 
to your claim, or when first becoming aware of the alleged discrimination. If you are amending or providing 
additional evidence to an existing open complaint, the form should be used, but EEO counseling is not required.      

IMPORTANT NOTE:  In certain situations, the information provided in Part III of the attached complaint form may be used in 
lieu of an affidavit in the investigation of your complaint. Accordingly, the information you provide in this part should be brief, 
clear, and complete.    

WHEN TO FILE:  In accordance with 29 CFR 1614.106, your formal complaint must be filed within 15 calendar days of the 
date you received the "Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint" from your EEO Counselor. You must sign and date 
your complaint. If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney may sign the complaint on your behalf.  

These time limits may be extended: 

1)

2)

3)

if you show that you were not notified of the time limits and were not otherwise aware of them, or

if you were prevented by circumstances beyond your control from submitting the matter within the time limits, or

for other reasons considered sufficient by the Department.

REPRESENTATION:  You may have a representative of your own choosing at all stages of the processing of your 
complaint. However, your representative will be disqualified if such representation would conflict with the official or collateral 
duties of the representative. No EEO Counselor, EEO Investigator or EEO Officer may serve as a representative. (Your 
representative need not be an attorney, but only an attorney representative may sign the complaint on your behalf.)      

WHERE TO FILE:  In accordance with 29 CFR 1614.106(c), your written complaint must be signed by you or your attorney. 
The complaint should be filed with the EEO Director of the Department of Homeland Security component where the alleged 
discrimination occurred. (Filing instructions are contained in the "Right to File" form, which was provided by your Counselor.) 
Keep a copy of the completed complaint form for your records.

Good morning Max,

We recently received some guidance regarding reasonable accommodations for the COVID-19 vaccination
Executive Order.   Please see below for instructions.

Requests for reasonable accommodation due to a disability should be submitted to the FEMA Office of Equal
Rights through the Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS). The employee should
upload FEMA form 256-01, Request for Reasonable Accommodation, and any supporting documentation with
the request. Questions can be directed to FEMA-Reasonable-Accommodation@fema.dhs.gov.

More information will be forthcoming on religious accommodations and medical exemption process..

Kind Regards,

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation Request# RAR0017691

1.  I respectfully request exemption form the VACCINE MANDATE, and hereby stipulate that I meet the definition

of a person having a “disability” under Sec. 12111(A)(8) of the Act.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 

3.  I respectfully request exemption form the VACCINE MANDATE due a strong moral and religious Objection to

vaccines that were derived from aborted fetal cells.

a.  It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently available

alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His
Commandments, for which I would be held morally accountable by God.

b.  For that reason, I am also requesting a religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas
and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19
vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment action be taken against me on account of my
religious beliefs. (1)

4.  Furthermore, recent case law arising from the Appeals in Darby v. Childvine Inc. et al; (No. 1:18-cv-0669)

concludes that no mandate of a party [an employer in this case] can interfere with a person’s “normal cell
growth” (pg. 6) for people or a class of people protected by the Act.

5.  The Emergency Use experimental gene therapy shots, colloquially and collectively called “Covid Vaccines,”
various parties are requiring you to receive are, in fact, designed to alter, impair and abrogate “normal cell
growth” by virtue of the genetic modifications made to your body that cause the production of Spike proteins
(sometimes “S-cells”); and as such may not be administered without express consent, whether the injectables
or drugs are approved by the FDA or not.

6.  “The FDA noted that Pfizer, “identified vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated

enhanced respiratory disease, as an important potential risk”.

7.  The EMA similarly acknowledged that “vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease” was “an important

potential risk… that may be specific to vaccination for COVID- 19”.

8.  Under current US Federal law and by international convention (Nuremberg Codex), no place of business or
otherwise, can seek your inoculation compliance with any drug or injectable, much less any of the four
available experimental gene therapy shots that are colloquially and collectively referred to as “Covid
Vaccines.”

9.  Such injectables are experimental, not fully approved by the FDA or any other authoritative body and may not
be compulsory as a matter of Federal law in the Emergency Use Authorization statute as more fully described
in 10 U.S. Code § 1107a.

10.  This subject is also covered by the Nuremberg Codex, which requires all signatory States to adopt the tenants

in their own Statutes, as is the case with US Federal law.

11.  In other words, there is no basis for me to submit to or provide evidence of compliance with any Covid

vaccination mandate whatsoever.

1.  Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was protein tested using the abortion-derived cell line HEK-293.
a.  This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute [2]. This information is recorded by the Cold

Spring Harbor Laboratory.

2.  Moderna – The Moderna Vaccine was protein tested using the abortion-derived cell line HEK-293.

a.  This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute.
b.  This information is cited by the vaccine researchers Kizzmekia S. Corbett, Darin K. Edwards, and Sarah R.

Leist.

 
 
3.  C. Johnson & Johnson – The J&J Vaccine has publicly admitted to using a cell line called PER.C6.

a.  This is published on the Janssen website [5]. This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute.

Good morning,

Thank you for submitting your request for reasonable accommodation (RA) and documents via the DHS Accessibility
Compliance Management System (ACMS). I understand from your FEMA Form 256 that you are requesting an
exemption from the executive order on mandatory COVID vaccination. However, there is no mention in any of the
documents submitted via ACMS of a disability or medical condition that prevents you from receiving the vaccine.
Please confirm if your request for exemption is due to a medical condition that prohibits you from getting vaccinated
or if you wish to proceed with requesting a vaccination exemption based on personal freedoms and/or religious
beliefs.

Respectfully,

Max, this afternoon, I had a pleasant and productive MS Teams visit with Tim Wick and Andrew
O’Donovan.

We recommend you contact Ms. Karina Aguilo, Mission Support Deputy Division Director,
karina.aguilo.fema.dhs.gov, 940.232.8781.

As I understand, Ms. Aguilo has offered to assist you with your Reasonable Accommodation Request.

Subject: Max Meindl Reasonable Accommodation Request

Good Afternoon –

I have been tasked with verifying accountability for all staff scheduled to be in office on their
designated days for the Houston office. I understand there is a pending Reasonable Accommodation
request for Max. Below is an outline of the steps necessary to determine next action items for Max
in the process re: his selected days in office for the Houston campus, as advised through discussion
with Mission Support.

When did employee initiate the Reasonable Accommodation request? Determine how long he
has been out of the office.

Identify employee’s RA specialist (person tasked with his RA request since beginning process)
and reach out to them about the pending request. If specific person cannot be located then
email stated inquiries to the Reasonable Accommodations mailbox.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inquire where in the process the request is. What items, documents, or other necessary items
are necessary to complete the process for request to be satisfied.  

Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%? If so,
was it a 90 day approval? Dates needed to show when approval was recorded. (Depending on
length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable accommodation request might not
be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

I am attempting to answer some of Max’s questions on next steps he needs to take and identify how
the request can be settled through the proper guidelines we were given. If further clarification is
needed please reach out to Karina Aguilo from Mission Support to advise.  

Thank you,

Yes, I received the same.
Appreciate the heads up.
I did go to the portal but the option to “prefer not to answer” was gone.
What next… Have you have VD? Are you vaccinated against the clap?
Do you have herpes? Do you have head lice?
Anyway, when you have time, let’s talk for a few minutes on teams.
Going to make some coffee and rise above this nightmare….

Notice  to  Supervisors  of  Employees  with  a  Non-Attestation  Status  for
the COVID-19 Vaccination

Subject: Non-Responsive Employees in Vaccine Status System

Dear BERGIN, JOHN W,

Our records indicate that the following individuals on your staff have not submitted any
information into the Vaccine Status System (VSS) as of October 20, 202. These individuals
are also receiving a separate reminder message from this mailbox about their non-responsive
status in VSS. If any of these individuals do not directly report to you, please work with your
timekeeper to make necessary corrections in WebTA. If you are a Temporary Duty
Supervisor, do not change employees’ WebTA certifier back to their Supervisor of Record.   

MEINDL, MAX

All FEMA employees, including those seeking an exemption from the vaccination
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must submit their vaccination status via the
Vaccination Status System (VSS) by November 9, 2021.

As a supervisor, you must remind your employees of the requirement to submit proof of their
vaccination status in the VSS. You may use language from the sample message below and the
attached upload instructions to contact your employees individually.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
accommodation. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

If you have any questions, please reach out to FEMA-COVID-Vaccine@fema.dhs.gov.

Sample Message to Non-Responsive Employees in VSS:

Dear MEINDL, MAX,

Upon review of Vaccine Status System data, it appears that you have not yet attested to your
vaccination status as of October 20, 2021.

All FEMA employees, including those who seek an exemption from the vaccination

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must complete and submit their vaccination
status via the VSS by November 9, 2021.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
exemption. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

The VSS now includes the functionality necessary to collect proof of vaccination as required
by the Executive Order and implementing guidance. You are required to upload proof of your
vaccination status in VSS.  

If you do not have proof of vaccination, you must contact your place of vaccination or
healthcare provider to obtain documentation that can be electronically uploaded into the
system by November 9.

If you intend to seek a religious or medical accommodation, select the option “I have not been
vaccinated” in VSS and submit an accommodation request once available. More information
on submitting a request is forthcoming.

Employees  who  fail  to  comply  with  the  Executive  Order  14043  requirement  to  be  fully
vaccinated  and  provide  proof  of  vaccination,  except  employees  who  have  a  pending  or
approved  vaccination  accommodation  request,  may  be  subject  to  discipline,  up  to  and
including termination. 

Additional  resources  and  frequently  asked  questions  (FAQ)  are  available  on  the  DHS  VSS
Connect  page  and  the  COVID-19  Employee  Hub.  Visit  the  Employee  Resources  page  for

Half transparency:
No RA process has been adequately or appropriately identified to date.
RE:
10/13/2021 email received:
We want to ensure this requirement and the consequences of not meeting it are fully understood:
If you are vaccinated, you must provide proof of vaccination by November 9, 2021 via the Vaccine
Status System. This week, you will receive an email with instructions for how to submit your proof of
vaccination.
If you wish to file a request for a reasonable accommodation exempting you from this requirement,
you must do so by November 9, 2021.
Information about how to request a reasonable accommodation on medical or religious grounds will
be provided within the next two weeks.
You will be given ample time to submit your request.
If your request is not approved, you will have two weeks (14 days) to receive a single dose
vaccination or the first dose of a two-dose vaccination should you choose to comply with the EO.
If you choose to remain unvaccinated and have not received approval for a reasonable
accommodation, you will be subject to discipline, up to and including removal from federal service.

Accommodation Requests
Employees cannot use the VSS to submit an exemption request from the COVID-19 vaccination
requirement for medical, disability, or religious reasons at this time.
Future updates to VSS will include this functionality.
Once VSS is updated to include this functionality, FEMA will communicate requirements.
Any accommodation request that has already been submitted will not be adjudicated until further
guidance is provided.
Employees may be required to provide additional documentation once the official process is
finalized.
Accommodation requests will be considered and adjudicated consistent with applicable guidance
and law.
If a request for an accommodation is denied, employees will be provided a reasonable amount of
time following the denial to become fully vaccinated.

Notice  to  Supervisors  of  Employees  with  a  Non-Attestation  Status  for
the COVID-19 Vaccination

Subject: Non-Responsive Employees in Vaccine Status System

Dear BERGIN, JOHN W,

Our records indicate that the following individuals on your staff have not submitted any
information into the Vaccine Status System (VSS) as of October 20, 202. These individuals
are also receiving a separate reminder message from this mailbox about their non-responsive
status in VSS. If any of these individuals do not directly report to you, please work with your
timekeeper to make necessary corrections in WebTA. If you are a Temporary Duty
Supervisor, do not change employees’ WebTA certifier back to their Supervisor of Record.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MEINDL, MAX

All FEMA employees, including those seeking an exemption from the vaccination
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must submit their vaccination status via the
Vaccination Status System (VSS) by November 9, 2021.

As a supervisor, you must remind your employees of the requirement to submit proof of their
vaccination status in the VSS. You may use language from the sample message below and the
attached upload instructions to contact your employees individually.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
accommodation. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

If you have any questions, please reach out to FEMA-COVID-Vaccine@fema.dhs.gov.

Sample Message to Non-Responsive Employees in VSS:

Dear MEINDL, MAX,

Upon review of Vaccine Status System data, it appears that you have not yet attested to your
vaccination status as of October 20, 2021.

All FEMA employees, including those who seek an exemption from the vaccination
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must complete and submit their vaccination
status via the VSS by November 9, 2021.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
exemption. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

The VSS now includes the functionality necessary to collect proof of vaccination as required
by the Executive Order and implementing guidance. You are required to upload proof of your
vaccination status in VSS.  

If you do not have proof of vaccination, you must contact your place of vaccination or
healthcare provider to obtain documentation that can be electronically uploaded into the
system by November 9.

If you intend to seek a religious or medical accommodation, select the option “I have not been
vaccinated” in VSS and submit an accommodation request once available. More information
on submitting a request is forthcoming.

Employees  who  fail  to  comply  with  the  Executive  Order  14043  requirement  to  be  fully
vaccinated  and  provide  proof  of  vaccination,  except  employees  who  have  a  pending  or
approved  vaccination  accommodation  request,  may  be  subject  to  discipline,  up  to  and

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including termination. 

Additional  resources  and  frequently  asked  questions  (FAQ)  are  available  on  the  DHS  VSS
Connect  page  and  the  COVID-19  Employee  Hub.  Visit  the  Employee  Resources  page  for
more information on DHS’s COVID-19 guidance.

7.  Briefly describe the specific accommodation requested: Continued Remote/telework, permanent 

exemption from vaccine mandate. 

8.  Employee due to "return to office" this week and every week after and respectfully requests timely 

consideration. 

B.  The reason for denying the temporary work request was stipulated as the following: 

1.  This position does not meet the Remote Work Policy. This position is a Program Delivery Manager 

Task Force Lead and requires regular in-person meetings with field staff (PDMGs), field leadership, 

and external stakeholders. 

C.  Appellant response to the reason stipulated by the ruling authority: 

1.  Appellant has been “teleworking” successfully since March of 2020.  For nearly 2.5 years I have been 

successfully performing my duties without ever once attending a meeting in person because my 

deployment is “virtual”. 

2.  My DTS stipulates I’m available only for “virtual” deployment. 

3.  My performance has been consistent and is verified by reviewing my latest evaluation: 

a. 

 Max Meindl 2nd Quarter Review: Max is in the role of Task Force Leader. He has done an 

amazing task of working with complex Applicants obligating approx..10 projects well into the 

Millions of Dollars. Due to COVID and several disasters hitting Louisiana back-to-back, 

applicants have been slower providing documentation. Despite these hurdles Max’s Team has 

sent 21 projects this quarter to the CRC for several million dollars. Max has done a fantastic 

job of managing his PDMG’s Project Delivery Plans and making sure the projections are 

accurate which is extremely important to the disaster. Max is one of my go-to Task Force 

Leader with his positive attitude he helps others on his team keep their motivation high. Max 

always steps up and takes on the most difficult of tasks without even being asked. I can’t say 

enough how much I enjoy working with Max. He is a true asset to this agency and in my 

opinion a candidate to take on other leadership roles within the agency.

D.  Appellant has underlying conditions that preclude the wearing of a mask due to COPD (Chronic obstructive 

pulmonary disease) and as such has breathing issues. 

E.  Appellant is considered an at-risk individual and does not want to expose himself to an office in a “high 

community level” area and be required to mask all day. 

F.  The current determination does not make any sense when considering the Appellant has worked “remotely” 

or “teleworked” for nearly two and one-half years. 

G.  A consideration for a temporary “remote work” does not seem unreasonable. 

H.  In previous conversation with Traci Brasher, I came away with the understanding that a first line supervisor 

could approve a temporary remote work option, not to exceed 60 days, if I recall correctly.  Maybe I 

misheard. 

APPELLANT HEREBY MOVES AND RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS RECONSIDERATION OF 

THE DENIAL OF A TEMPORARY REMOTE WORK REQUEST. 

APPELLANT MOVES AND HEREBY REQUESTS THAT THE ORGANIZATION PROCESS THE 

SPECIFIC PAPERWORK AS SUBMITTED BY THE APPELLANT AND NOT CREATE NEW FORM

Update on your vaccine mandate exemption request
Friday, February 4, 2022 3:16:38 PM

Office of the Chief Information Officer
OAST ACMS Notification

You are receiving this message because our records show that you requested an exemption from (or a
temporary delay in) complying with the vaccination requirement established in Executive Order 14043.  On
January 21, 2022, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a nationwide
preliminary injunction enjoining federal agencies from implementing or enforcing President Biden’s
September 9, 2021 Executive Order 14043, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal
Employees.  To comply with this injunction, DHS is halting the review process for those who have
requested a religious or medical exemption to the vaccine mandate.  So long as the nationwide injunction is
in place, an exemption to the mandate is not necessary. 

While the litigation of this matter is pending, please be advised that the court’s injunction does not affect
workplace safety protocols related to vaccination status, such as masking, physical distancing, testing, travel,
and quarantine requirements or accommodation requests regarding such protocols.  Employees should
continue to comply with such workplace safety protocols as directed.  While we await a final disposition
from the courts, we will continue to keep your exemption request on file, and we will continue to keep you
updated as new guidance is received.
