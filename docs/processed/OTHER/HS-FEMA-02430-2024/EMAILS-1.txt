Good morning Max,  

I believe a little while back you requested to work reduced hours due to medical restrictions. I have reached out to ERO to 
get more guidance on what employees can do in situations where a supervisor/leadership initially denies an alternative 
work schedule that was due to medical reason. If you still need or wish to pursue an alternate work schedule through the 
reasonable accommodation route you can reach out to ERO for more guidance.

Good morning,  

FMLA does not carry any leave. FMLA allows an employee to take up to 480 hours of unpaid for a personal or family 
medical situation.  

Excerpt from OPM: 
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), most Federal employees are entitled to a total of up to 12 
workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period. 

An employee may elect to substitute annual leave and/or sick leave, consistent with current laws and OPM's 
regulations for using annual and sick leave, for any unpaid leave under the FMLA.  

The employee can request FMLA LWOP, but will not receive any compensation. If the employee wishes to be paid while 
out on leave they will need to use their annual or sick leave with the FMLA code.  

If you have additional questions or need me to go into further detail please let me know.

§825.202   Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule. 

(a) Definition. FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. 
Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave 
schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per 
workday. A reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule for a period of time, normally from full-time 
to part-time. 

(b) Medical necessity. For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule taken because of one's own serious 
health condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered 
servicemember with a serious injury or illness, there must be a medical need for leave and it must be that such medical 
need can be best accommodated through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The treatment regimen and other 
information described in the certification of a serious health condition and in the certification of a serious injury or 
illness, if required by the employer, addresses the medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave 
schedule. See §§825.306, 825.310. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically 
necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical treatment of a serious health condition or of a covered 
servicemember's serious injury or illness, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a serious health condition or 
a covered servicemember's serious injury or illness. It may also be taken to provide care or psychological comfort to a 
covered family member with a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. 

(1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health condition of a spouse, parent, son, or daughter, for the 
employee's own serious health condition, or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember which requires 
treatment by a health care provider periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include leave 
of periods from an hour or more to several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave would include leave taken on an 
occasional basis for medical appointments, or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of six months, 
such as for chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own 
condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced leave 

7

 
 
schedule is an employee who is recovering from a serious health condition and is not strong enough to work a full-time 
schedule. 

(2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for absences where the employee or family member is 
incapacitated or unable to perform the essential functions of the position because of a chronic serious health condition 
or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, even if he or she does not receive treatment by a health care 
provider. See §§825.113 and 825.127. 

(c) Birth or placement. When leave is taken after the birth of a healthy child or placement of a healthy child for adoption 
or foster care, an employee may take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the employer agrees. 
Such a schedule reduction might occur, for example, where an employee, with the employer's agreement, works part-
time after the birth of a child, or takes leave in several segments. The employer's agreement is not required, however, 
for leave during which the expectant mother has a serious health condition in connection with the birth of her child or if 
the newborn child has a serious health condition. See §825.204 for rules governing transfer to an alternative position 
that better accommodates intermittent leave. See also §825.120 (pregnancy) and §825.121 (adoption and foster care). 

(d) Qualifying exigency. Leave due to a qualifying exigency may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule 
basis.

Good morning,  

FMLA does not carry any leave. FMLA allows an employee to take up to 480 hours of unpaid for a personal or family 
medical situation.  

Excerpt from OPM: 
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), most Federal employees are entitled to a total of up to 12 
workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period. 

An employee may elect to substitute annual leave and/or sick leave, consistent with current laws and OPM's 
regulations for using annual and sick leave, for any unpaid leave under the FMLA.  

The employee can request FMLA LWOP, but will not receive any compensation. If the employee wishes to be paid while 
out on leave they will need to use their annual or sick leave with the FMLA code.  

If you have additional questions or need me to go into further detail please let me know.  

Regards,

Randy, 
My understanding is that with approved MFLA I am not required to use up my sick days or annual leave. 
I requested MFLA leave without pay which I have been doing for several weeks now. 
Please advise soonest. 

“Cannot take TWOP until all your leave has been used. Also please put the hours in the day block of the calendar. Thank You Randy Atchison”

Good afternoon Max,  

Prior to becoming a CORE for the TRO were you employed with FEMA? Currently, you have been with the TRO since 
June 2018 thus, you do not meet the 1 yr requirement for FMLA. If you have prior time with FEMA as a CORE, reservist, 
or local hire please let me know so that I can verify the time.

Good afternoon Max, 

I am performing timekeeping duties while your regular timekeeper is out of the office.  In reviewing your timesheet, I 
see that you are claiming LWOP – FMLA.   

Have you been approved for FMLA?   

If you have, I apologize as the paperwork was not provided to the Austin office.  If not, the leave category should be 
changed to LWOP until you receive approval. 

Please let us know the status of your FMLA application as soon as possible so that we can move forward with your 
timesheet certification. 

Respectfully,

Good morning Mr. Meindl, 

You need to communicate to your supervisor of record the need take FMLA leave at least 30 calendar days before the 
start of the planned absence. I have attached the Absence and Leave Manual for your review. Chapter 5 addresses 
FMLA.  

27

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I have also received the medical certification in connection with your request for FMLA leave.; however, the following 
required information is missing from the medical certification or is vague and needs clarification:  

1. 

It is not clear whether you need FMLA leave intermittently or for a continuous period of time or both.  

a. 

b. 

If your FMLA leave is for a continuous period of time, your doctor needs to state so. In the medical 
documentation you provided it only states “a few days after heart surgery”.  In addition, the your doctor 
will need to include the date of your surgery. 
If your request is for intermittent leave for a planned medical treatment, the dates (actual or estimates) 
on which such treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treatment, and the period of 
recovery, if any, before you would be able to return to work; 

2.  Your medical provider stated that your condition will cause episodic flare ups; however, the certification is 

missing the frequency of the flare ups. The medical certification needs to include an estimate of the frequency 
of the flare ups and the duration of related incapacity that you may have over the next 6 months (Part B, 
question #7). 

Please be advised that the complete medical documentation is due 15 calendar days from this email.  

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,
