ment of a workday. 

Day means a calendar day. 
Similar  positions  means  positions  in 
which the duties performed are similar 
in  nature  and  character  and  require

sitions  without  significant  training  or 
undue interruption to the work.

employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a 
temporary  status  without  duties  and

sion  against  an  employee  on  the  basis

tice  must  state  the  specific  reason(s)

port the reasons for action given in the

ered  by  this  subpart  is  entitled  to  be 

represented  by  an  attorney  or  other 
representative.  An  agency  may  dis-
allow  as  an  employee’s  representative 
an  individual  whose  activities  as  rep-
resentative  would  cause  a  conflict  of 
interest  or  position,  or  an  employee  of 
the  agency  whose  release  from  his  or 
her  official  position  would  give  rise  to 
unreasonable  costs  or  whose  priority 
work  assignments  preclude  his  or  her 
release. 

(e)  Agency  decision.  (1)  In  arriving  at 
its  decision,  the  agency  will  consider

cial. 

(2)  The  agency  must  specify  in  writ-
ing  the  reason(s)  for  the  decision  and

tice  of  decision  to  the  employee  on  or 
before  the  effective  date  of  the  action. 
(f) Grievances. The employee may file 
a  grievance  through  an  agency  admin-
istrative  grievance  system  (if  applica-
ble)  or,  if  the  suspension  falls  within 
the  coverage  of  an  applicable  nego-
tiated  grievance  procedure,  an  em-
ployee  in  an  exclusive  bargaining  unit 
may  file  a  grievance  only  under  that 
procedure.  Sections 
7114(a)(5)  and 
7121(b)(1)(C)  of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  and 
the  terms  of  any  collective  bargaining 
agreement,  govern  representation  for 
employees  in  an  exclusive  bargaining 
unit who grieve a suspension under this 
subpart  through  the  negotiated  griev-
ance procedure.

§ 752.403 

5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–12 Edition) 

Pay means the rate of basic pay fixed 
by law or administrative action for the 
position  held  by  the  employee,  that  is, 
the  rate  of  pay  before  any  deductions 
and  exclusive  of  additional  pay  of  any 
kind. 

Similar  positions  means  positions  in 
which the duties performed are similar 
in  nature  and  character  and  require 
substantially  the  same  or  similar 
qualifications,  so  that  the  incumbent 
could  be  interchanged  between  the  po-
sitions  without  significant  training  or 
undue interruption to the work. 

Suspension  means  the  placing  of  an 
employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a 
temporary  status  without  duties  and 
pay for more than 14 days. 

§ 752.403 Standard for action. 

(a)  An  agency  may  take  an  adverse 
action,  including  a  performance-based 
adverse  action  or  an  indefinite  suspen-
sion,  under  this  subpart  only  for  such 
cause  as  will  promote  the  efficiency  of 
the service. 

(b)  An  agency  may  not  take  an  ad-
verse  action  against  an  employee  on 
the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 
U.S.C. 2302. 

§ 752.404 Procedures. 

(a)  Statutory  entitlements.  An  em-
ployee against whom action is proposed 
under  this  subpart  is  entitled  to  the 
procedures  provided  in  5  U.S.C.  7513(b). 
(b)  Notice  of  proposed  action.  (1)  An 
employee  against  whom  an  action  is 
proposed is entitled to at least 30 days’ 
advance  written  notice  unless  there  is 
an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of  this  section.  The  notice  must  state 
the  specific  reason(s)  for  the  proposed 
action, and inform the employee of his 
or  her  right  to  review  the  material 
which  is  relied  on  to  support  the  rea-
sons for action given in the notice. 

(2)  When  some  but  not  all  employees 
in  a  given  competitive  level  are  being 
furloughed,  the  notice  of  proposed  ac-
tion  must  state  the  basis  for  selecting 
a  particular  employee  for  furlough,  as 
well as the reasons for the furlough. 

(3) Under ordinary circumstances,  an 
employee whose removal or suspension, 
including  indefinite  suspension,  has 
been  proposed  will  remain  in  a  duty 
status  in  his  or  her  regular  position 
during  the  advance  notice  period.  In 

those  rare  circumstances  where  the 
agency determines that the employee’s 
continued  presence  in  the  workplace 
during  the  notice  period  may  pose  a 
threat  to  the  employee  or  others,  re-
sult  in  loss  of  or  damage  to  Govern-
ment property, or otherwise jeopardize 
legitimate  Government  interests,  the 
agency may elect one or a combination 
of the following alternatives: 

(i)  Assigning  the  employee  to  duties 
where he or she is no longer a threat to 
safety,  the  agency  mission,  or  to  Gov-
ernment property; 

(ii)  Allowing  the  employee  to  take 
leave, or carrying him or her in an ap-
propriate  leave  status  (annual,  sick, 
leave  without  pay,  or  absence  without 
leave)  if  the  employee  has  absented 
himself  or  herself  from  the  worksite 
without requesting leave; 

(iii)  Curtailing  the  notice  period 
when the agency can invoke the provi-
sions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; 
or 

(iv)  Placing  the  employee  in  a  paid, 
nonduty status for such time as is nec-
essary to effect the action. 

(c)  Employee’s  answer.  (1)  An  em-
ployee  may  answer  orally  and  in  writ-
ing  except  as  provided  in  paragraph 
(c)(2)  of  this  section.  The  agency  must 
give the employee a reasonable amount 
of  official  time  to  review  the  material 
relied  on  to  support  its  proposed  ac-
tion,  to  prepare  an  answer  orally  and 
in  writing,  and  to  secure  affidavits,  if 
the  employee  is  in  an  active  duty  sta-
tus.  The  agency  may  require  the  em-
ployee  to  furnish  any  answer  to  the 
proposed  action,  and  affidavits  and 
other documentary evidence in support 
of  the  answer,  within  such  time  as 
would  be  reasonable,  but  not  less  than 
7 days. 

(2) The agency will designate an offi-
cial to hear the employee’s oral answer

§ 752.406 

(3) If the employee wishes the agency 
to  consider  any  medical  condition 
which  may  contribute  to  a  conduct, 
performance, or leave problem, the em-
ployee must be given a reasonable time 
to  furnish  medical  documentation  (as 
defined  in  § 339.104  of  this  chapter)  of 
the  condition.  Whenever  possible,  the 
employee  will  supply  such  documenta-
tion within the time limits allowed for 
an answer. 

(d)  Exceptions.  (1)  Section  7513(b)  of 
title  5,  U.S.  Code,  authorizes  an  excep-
tion to the 30 days’ advance written no-
tice  when  the  agency  has  reasonable 
cause to believe that the employee has 
committed  a  crime  for  which  a  sen-
tence of imprisonment may be imposed 
and  is  proposing  a  removal  or  suspen-
sion,  including  indefinite  suspension. 
This  notice  exception  is  commonly  re-
ferred  to  as  the  ‘‘crime  provision.’’ 
This provision may be invoked even in 
the absence of judicial action. 

(2)  The  advance  written  notice  and 
opportunity to answer are not required 
for furlough without pay due to unfore-
seeable  circumstances,  such  as  sudden 
breakdowns  in  equipment,  acts  of  God, 
or sudden emergencies requiring imme-
diate curtailment of activities. 

(e)  Representation.  Section  7513(b)(3) 
of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  provides  that  an 
employee  covered  by  this  part  is  enti-
tled  to  be  represented  by  an  attorney 
or  other  representative.  An  agency 
may  disallow  as  an  employee’s  rep-
resentative an individual whose activi-
ties  as  representative  would  cause  a 
conflict  of  interest  or  position,  or  an 
employee  of  the  agency  whose  release 
from  his  or  her  official  position  would 
give  rise  to  unreasonable  costs  or 
whose  priority  work  assignments  pre-
clude his or her release. 

(f)  Agency  review  of  medical  informa-
tion.  When  medical  information  is  sup-
plied  by  the  employee  pursuant  to 
paragraph  (c)(3)  of  this  section,  the 
agency  may,  if  authorized,  require  a 
medical examination under the criteria 
of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, 
at  its  option,  offer  a  medical  examina-
tion  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of 
§ 339.302 of this chapter. If the employee 
has the requisite years of service under 
the  Civil  Service  Retirement  System 
or  the  Federal  Employees’  Retirement 
System, the agency must provide infor-

mation  concerning  disability  retire-
ment. The agency must be aware of the 
affirmative  obligations  of  the  provi-
sions  of  29  CFR  1614.203,  which  require 
reasonable  accommodation  of  a  quali-
fied individual with a disability. 

(g)  Agency  decision.  (1)  In  arriving  at 
its  decision,  the  agency  will  consider 
only the reasons specified in the notice 
of  proposed  action  and  any  answer  of 
the  employee  or  his  or  her  representa-
tive, or both, made to a designated offi-
cial  and  any  medical  documentation 
reviewed  under  paragraph  (f)  of  this 
section. 

(2) The notice must specify in writing 
the reasons for the decision and advise 
the  employee  of  any  appeal  or  griev-
ance  rights  under  § 752.405  of  this  part. 
The  agency  must  deliver  the  notice  of 
decision  to  the  employee  on  or  before 
the effective date of the action. 

(h)  Applications  for  disability  retire-
ment. Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter 
provides  that  an  employee’s  applica-
tion  for  disability  retirement  need  not 
delay  any  other  appropriate  personnel 
action.  Section  831.1205  and  § 844.202  of 
this  chapter  set  forth  the  basis  under 
which  an  agency  must  file  an  applica-
tion for disability retirement on behalf 
of an employee. 

§ 752.405 Appeal and grievance rights. 
(a)  Appeal  rights.  Under  the  provi-
sions  of  5  U.S.C.  7513(d),  an  employee 
against whom an action is taken under 
this subpart is entitled to appeal to the 
Merit Systems Protection Board. 

(b)  Grievance  rights.  As  provided  at  5 
U.S.C. 7121(e)(1), if a matter covered by 
this  subpart  falls  within  the  coverage 
of  an  applicable  negotiated  grievance 
procedure,  an  employee  may  elect  to 
file  a  grievance  under  that  procedure 
or appeal to the Merit Systems Protec-
tion Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701, but not 
both. 
and 
7121(b)(1)(C)  of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  and 
the  terms  of  an  applicable  collective 
bargaining  agreement,  govern  rep-
resentation  for  employees  in  an  exclu-
sive bargaining unit who grieve a mat-
ter  under  this  subpart  through  the  ne-
gotiated grievance procedure.

(b)  An  agency  may  not  take  an  ad-

tence of imprisonment may be imposed 
and  is  proposing  a  removal  or  suspen-
sion.  This  notice  exception  is  com-
monly  referred  to  as  the  ‘‘crime  provi-
sion.’’  This  provision  may  be  invoked
