Thank you for the information.  I have attached a copy of the Reasonable
Accommodation Fact Sheet and I have highlighted in yellow the questions
that need to be addressed in your doctor's note. I would recommend taking
this with you to your appointment.

I have reattached your 256.  You and your SOR (Supervisor of Record)  will
need to have an interactive conversation  to discuss the need of your
request.  Page 1 has already been completed.  Your SOR will need to review
your doctors note and complete page 2 of the 256 to include box 16, with a
detailed explanation.  Once all is completed, please get page 1 and 2 back
to me.  If should have any questions, please let me know.

Warm Regards,

Subject: RE: FMLA/Reasonable accommodation

JG,
I am concerned about exposure to sneezing and coughing here at work and
was considering requesting a short term (2-6 weeks) reasonable
accommodation to medical-telework while this virus makes its way through
the population.
With a weakened immune system, heart issues and respiratory issues (COPD)
and using inhalers, needless to say, I am way beyond concerned.
I don't want to seem like a scare monger or get on leaderships bad boy
list for requesting an RA, so I don't know what to do at this time.
I am very concerned.
Please advise soonest.

When considering the escalating issue with the Corona Virus, I found this
information from a CDC presentation yesterday:

Transcript for the CDC Telebriefing Update on COVID-19
Press Briefing Transcript
Tuesday, March 3, 2020

While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a
report out of China suggest serious illness occurs in 16% of cases.
Older people and people with underlying health conditions, like heart
disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, were about twice as
likely to develop serious outcomes versus otherwise younger, healthier
people.
We are particularly concerned about these people given the growing number
of cases in the United States as well as those with suspected community
spread.
There are a spectrum of actions that can reduce spread and impact.
These are science-based and come from our play book on mitigating disease
impact.
I want to stress the personal action that individuals can take.
Each year we recommend people wash their hands, cover their cough and
sneezes and stay away from people who are sick.
This is the other side of not spreading the disease, which is not catching
it.  Think twice before you expose yourself to someone who is showing
symptoms.
This is especially important for people who are older and have underlying
health conditions.  For seniors, preparedness may also mean making sure
you have adequate supplies of routine medications, like medication for
blood pressure and diabetes.  This is always part of what CDC recommends
for preparedness.
If you're 65 and older and particularly if you live in areas where there's
on going community spread, you need to think about what actions you can
take to reduce your exposure.

From CDC Alert:
What May Happen

More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days,
including more cases in the United States.
It's also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur,
including in communities in the United States.
It's likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the
United States will occur.
Widespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of
people needing medical care at the same time.
Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass
gatherings may experience more absenteeism.

Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated
rates of hospitalizations and deaths.
Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical
services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care
providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed.

Subject: FMLA/Reasonable accommodation

Good morning,

Thank you for providing the FMLA update information. Your FMLA file has
been updated accordingly. Within your documentation your physician states
you have a disabling medical condition which needs to be accommodated. As
you know on prior occasions I have recommended you request a Reasonable
Accommodations for your condition.  I have attached the FEMA Form 256 for
your review and consideration again. Your physician indicates you need
scheduling flexibility therefore I have prepared the form for you in draft
to consider. Your physician also indicated that your absences may become
more excessive. If this occurs then at that time we will work with you
accordingly to see if other arrangements need to be made.

The ERO Lead for the TRO is Keya Jackson (202-856-1961). You can reach out
to her with any questions you may have about the reasonable accommodations
process.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
