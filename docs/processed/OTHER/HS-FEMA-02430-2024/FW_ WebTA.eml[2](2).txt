Good morning,

FMLA does not carry any leave. FMLA allows an employee to take up to 480
hours of unpaid for a personal or family medical situation.

Excerpt from OPM:
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), most Federal
employees are entitled to a total of up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave
during any 12-month period.

An employee may elect to substitute annual leave and/or sick leave,
consistent with current laws and OPM's regulations for using annual and
sick leave, for any unpaid leave under the FMLA.

The employee can request FMLA LWOP, but will not receive any compensation.
If the employee wishes to be paid while out on leave they will need to use
their annual or sick leave with the FMLA code.

If you have additional questions or need me to go into further detail
please let me know.

Regards,

Randy,
My understanding is that with approved MFLA I am not required to use up my
sick days or annual leave.
I requested MFLA leave without pay which I have been doing for several
weeks now.
Please advise soonest.

"Cannot take TWOP until all your leave has been used. Also please put the
hours in the day block of the calendar. Thank You Randy Atchison"
