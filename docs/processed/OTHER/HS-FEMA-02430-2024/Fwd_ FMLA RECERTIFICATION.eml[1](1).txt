Subject: FMLA RECERTIFICATION

"CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL RECORDS"

As part of the certification process, the employer will almost certainly
obtain sensitive medical information regarding the employee.  The FMLA
right to privacy places strict limits on how the employer must treat this
information.  Federal
regulations<https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/825.500> require that
information related to an FMLA leave request must be treated as
"confidential medical records" and kept in "separate files/records from
the usual personnel files."  This point is important, and bears repeating:
employee medical information should never be kept in the employee's basic
personnel file. Instead, the employer must keep a second, parallel
personnel file which includes any information related to the FMLA request
or other employee medical issues.  If a  supervisor - or anyone else -
asks for a worker's personnel file, the company should provide the file
without the medical information.
