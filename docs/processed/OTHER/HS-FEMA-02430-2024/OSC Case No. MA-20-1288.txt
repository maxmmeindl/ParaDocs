Hello Mr. Meindl:



As you are aware, I have been investigating the above referenced OSC complaint in which you allege that you were retaliated against for filing an EEO complaint to FEMA’s Director of Civil Rights and the Department of Homeland Security’s EEOC Office, and for e-mailing FEMA’s Chief of Staff Sandra Cooley regarding issues you had with management’s processing of your FMLA request. Specifically, you were retaliated against by not being selected for a position of Task Force Lead and were written up for copying and pasting a co-worker’s written response and sending it to another co-worker.


While discrimination based on handicapping conditions, as well as reprisal for filing an EEO complaint, are prohibited personnel practices, OSC’s regulation 5 C.F.R. § 1810.1 notes that it was not intended for OSC to duplicate or bypass the procedures established by the agencies and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for resolving such allegations. Therefore, it is the general policy of the Special Counsel not to take action on such allegations as they are more appropriately resolved through the EEO process. Because of these constraints, we have made a determination to close your case. Please understand that we are not saying your circumstances have been easy, ideal or completely fair.



Best,

Marko Cvijanovic
Attorney
U.S. Office of Special Counsel
Dallas Field Office
