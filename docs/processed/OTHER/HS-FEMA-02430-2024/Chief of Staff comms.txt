Ms. Cooley,

Thank you so very much for the clarification.

I hope to have the recertification done this week or early next week, based
upon current medical issues/assessments although, I have been scheduled for
additional CAT scans and associated testing.

The scope of the medical issues is evolving but I very much appreciate
having a workload that keeps me busy and distracted from my physical issues,
although my morning startup is a bit challenging.

I try to be here by 8:30 - 09:00 and work until 4:30 or 5:30 to ensure I get
my full 8 hours in.

This year, with all of the unpaid leave, has put a definite stress on the
family and the finances.

I appreciate you kind and detailed response to my concerns.

Max,



Thank you for reaching out. I want you to know that your Supervisor, Tim
Wick is working hard to ensure he takes care of and supports all of his
employees. At this Tim is only attempting to ensure that you have a updated
FMLA in place nothing more. Next he will reassess the workload of all staff
performing the same work and each person is contributing  to the workload in
a manner consistent with the requirements of their assigned position. He
will make the necessary adjustments to ensure the workload is properly
distributed in a manner which provides equity to his employees and
efficiency of support to customers. Any employee carrying too much will have
the work reduced and any employee not carrying enough will have the work
increased. Employees who need FMLA or Reasonable Accommodations will be
supported without exception. However this does not mean that we will reduce
the quantity or quality of the work to be performed. Employees who need to
take leave will be required to manage their workload and not allow their
absences to impact their customers or put a burden on their co-workers to
cover for them. Tim's approach of each employee being held accountable to
perform the work assigned is a little different than his previously
approach. In the past Tim when employees called in at the last minute he
assigned others to cover for them in the new approach he will assign others
to cover and then have the absent employee cover for the other employee to
keep the workload distributed equally. This approach is not designed to make
anyone feel singled out but rather to create a work environment where the
expectation is that each employee contributes toward the mission consistent
in regards to quality and quantity of work performed.



Please be patient as we go through this process of supporting Tim and other
TRO Supervisors who have been so driven from a JFO perspective to just get
the work done that as we shift to more of a fix cite operational posture we
have to also foster a work environment which supports high performing teams
where everyone contributes with or without an accommodation or FMLA.



I hope this email helps to clarify your understanding.

Ms. Cooley,

I am forwarding this email to you for information purposes.

I have no problem doing the FMLA recertification, subject to the time issues
and making appointments.

What concerns me is that I feel as if I have been singled out for special
attention.

The who of that issue is subject to a bit of detective work but I know who
has questioned me in the past.

If I wasn't doing my job, that would be one thing but I am doing it and I do
it well.

If you have any insight or words of encouragement.. send them on.



Be well.

JG,

My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose,
throat) group at the DeBakey VA hospital to attempt to ascertain the source
for my recurring dizzy spells.

My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020.

My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is also next year.

I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient
clinic, but I'm not sure if that can happen within 15 days, it is the VA, so
nothing is for certain.

I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private
physician in Bellville.

I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has
identified, in the onboarding process, as an individual with a disability
and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent
associated health issues, I am concerned about the way the institution
and/or individuals within the institution, treat those identified as
disabled, more specifically, myself.

If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn't and I don't
understand.

It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my
opinion.

I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my
recovery but, I must admit that it has been an extremely distasteful
experience with other FEMA personnel.



I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am
concerned about the 15 day window.



Please advise.

Subject: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl



Good afternoon Max,

On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a serious/chronic
health condition.  Given that it has now been more than thirty (30) calendar
days since your last medical update for your current FMLA condition, I am
requesting that you provide me with an FMLA recertification as it relates to
your current FMLA condition of record.  The recertification is now necessary
to ensure that the workload on your team can be planned and managed
effectively while assisting you during your time of recovery.  Therefore, I
am requesting that you work with your physician to respond to all questions
where appropriate especially those related to the questions identified
below. These questions are not separate and apart from the recertification
form but can be responded to within the context of the questions already
provided on the form.  (29 CFR 825.308(a), permits recertification every 30
days for chronic or permanent/long-term conditions.)

Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update:

  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the specific
condition listed on your FMLA application dated and signed by your
physician, on 4/11/2019.

  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your condition
& if you will be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time.  (See
questions #1 & #4).

  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned
appointments within the next 30 days. (See Question #5)

  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on
an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, including any time for recovery.
(See Question #6)

  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will have
flare-ups during your recovery period (if known) that will prevent you from
performing your job functions. (See question #7).

Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My
goal remains to work cooperatively with you and your physician in a manner
which affords you the best opportunity to recover and return to full time
employment status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA
Recertification information within fifteen (15) working days of receipt will
result in the denial of any FMLA related leave until the information is
provided.

If you experience difficulty providing this information within the specified
period, please see me, or in my absence Patricia David, and provide a brief
written statement documenting your hardship and your request for extension
will be responded to within three (3) working days.

Regards,

Subject: RE: FMLA/Reasonable accommodation

JG,
I am concerned about exposure to sneezing and coughing here at work and was
considering requesting a short term (2-6 weeks) reasonable accommodation to
medical-telework while this virus makes its way through the population.
With a weakened immune system, heart issues and respiratory issues (COPD)
and using inhalers, needless to say, I am way beyond concerned.
I don't want to seem like a scare monger or get on leaderships bad boy list
for requesting an RA, so I don't know what to do at this time.
I am very concerned.
Please advise soonest.

When considering the escalating issue with the Corona Virus, I found this
information from a CDC presentation yesterday:

Transcript for the CDC Telebriefing Update on COVID-19
Press Briefing Transcript
Tuesday, March 3, 2020

While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a
report out of China suggest serious illness occurs in 16% of cases.
Older people and people with underlying health conditions, like heart
disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, were about twice as likely
to develop serious outcomes versus otherwise younger, healthier people.
We are particularly concerned about these people given the growing number of
cases in the United States as well as those with suspected community spread.
There are a spectrum of actions that can reduce spread and impact.
These are science-based and come from our play book on mitigating disease
impact.
I want to stress the personal action that individuals can take.
Each year we recommend people wash their hands, cover their cough and
sneezes and stay away from people who are sick.
This is the other side of not spreading the disease, which is not catching
it.  Think twice before you expose yourself to someone who is showing
symptoms.
This is especially important for people who are older and have underlying
health conditions.  For seniors, preparedness may also mean making sure you
have adequate supplies of routine medications, like medication for blood
pressure and diabetes.  This is always part of what CDC recommends for
preparedness.
If you're 65 and older and particularly if you live in areas where there's
on going community spread, you need to think about what actions you can take
to reduce your exposure.

From CDC Alert:
What May Happen

More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the coming days,
including more cases in the United States.
It's also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur,
including in communities in the United States.
It's likely that at some point, widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the
United States will occur.
Widespread transmission of COVID-19 would translate into large numbers of
people needing medical care at the same time.
Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings
may experience more absenteeism.

Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated
rates of hospitalizations and deaths.
Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical
services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care
providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed.

Subject: FMLA/Reasonable accommodation

Good morning,

Thank you for providing the FMLA update information. Your FMLA file has been
updated accordingly. Within your documentation your physician states you
have a disabling medical condition which needs to be accommodated. As you
know on prior occasions I have recommended you request a Reasonable
Accommodations for your condition.  I have attached the FEMA Form 256 for
your review and consideration again. Your physician indicates you need
scheduling flexibility therefore I have prepared the form for you in draft
to consider. Your physician also indicated that your absences may become
more excessive. If this occurs then at that time we will work with you
accordingly to see if other arrangements need to be made.

The ERO Lead for the TRO is Keya Jackson (202-856-1961). You can reach out
to her with any questions you may have about the reasonable accommodations
process.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Regards,
