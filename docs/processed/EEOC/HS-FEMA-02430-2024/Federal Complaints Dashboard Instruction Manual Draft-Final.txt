Overview of the Federal Complaints Dashboard 

The Federal Complaints Dashboard (FCD) reports agency-level federal sector 
complaint data starting from fiscal year (FY) 2013.  The FCD complements the 
complaint tables, also known as B-Tables found on the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission’s Federal Sector Reports webpage. The EEOC collects this 
data from the Annual Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Statistical Report of 
Discrimination Complaints (Form 462), which are submitted and certified by Federal 
agencies.    

The Federal Complaints Dashboard allows the user to view key complaint statistics for 
all Form 462 agencies. Currently, the dashboard consists of the following topics: 

•  Federal Sector EEO: At a Glance 

• 

Investigations 

•  Counselings and Complaints 

•  Closures 

•  Closures with Benefits 

•  ADR (Informal and Formal) 

•  Bases 

• 

Issues 

Additional functionality and content will be added as we continue to develop this 
platform.
