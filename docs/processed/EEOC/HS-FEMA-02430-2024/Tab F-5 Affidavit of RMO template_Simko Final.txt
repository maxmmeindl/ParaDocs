I HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING: 

I have an obligation to cooperate fully with the investigator, who has been assigned to conduct a

a statement for the investigative record which is true and complete to the best of my knowledge 
and belief and which fully addresses the issues accepted for investigation.  My statement must be

firsthand knowledge of any information which is directly related to the issue(s).  My statement,

description of the issues for investigation shall serve as the basis for the investigation.  While I 
may  voluntarily  submit  any  additional  documents  or  information  to  the  investigator  for 
consideration, it will be the investigator's responsibility to determine what evidence shall actually 
become part of the investigative report.  If there are any documents or facts which substantiate my 
allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest witnesses to be interviewed by the investigator.  However, the investigator will decide 
which witnesses to interview based on relevant information he or she feels will be furnished.

accordance  with  the  rules,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  This means that any employee(s) 
whom I accuse of discrimination or other acts of impropriety may be shown relevant portions of 
this statement and be given an opportunity to respond.  Agency officials responsible for processing 
complaints of discrimination will have access to the entire investigative report.  If discrimination 
is found, any employee accused of discrimination will have an opportunity to review the report in

complaint processing.

preparation of my statement (so long as my choice does not result in a conflict of interest).  I have

have  not  chosen  a  representative  but  obtain  a  representative  at  a  later  date,  I  will  advise  the
