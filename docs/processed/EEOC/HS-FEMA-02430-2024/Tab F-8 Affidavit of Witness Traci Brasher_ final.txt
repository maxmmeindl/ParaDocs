I HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING: 

I have an obligation to cooperate fully with the investigator, who has been assigned to conduct a 
thorough and impartial investigation of my complaint of discrimination.  Therefore, I must provide 
a statement for the investigative record which is true and complete to the best of my knowledge 
and belief and which fully addresses the issues accepted for investigation.  My statement must be 
specific with regard to names, dates, places, circumstances, and related events, and disclose my 
firsthand knowledge of any information which is directly related to the issue(s).  My statement, 
along with my Informal Complaint, Counselor's Summary Report, my Formal Complaint and the 
description of the issues for investigation shall serve as the basis for the investigation.  While I 
may  voluntarily  submit  any  additional  documents  or  information  to  the  investigator  for 
consideration, it will be the investigator's responsibility to determine what evidence shall actually 
become part of the investigative report.  If there are any documents or facts which substantiate my 
allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest witnesses to be interviewed by  the  investigator.   However, the investigator will decide 
which witnesses to interview based on relevant information he or she feels will be furnished. 

My  statement  is  made  under  oath  (or  affirmation)  without  a  pledge  of  confidentiality;  in 
accordance  with  the  rules,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  This means that any employee(s) 
whom I accuse of discrimination or other acts of impropriety may be shown relevant portions of 
this statement and be given an opportunity to respond.  Agency officials responsible for processing 
complaints of discrimination will have access to the entire investigative report.  If discrimination 
is found, any employee accused of discrimination will have an opportunity to review the report in 
its entirety without deletions.  Participants in the discrimination complaint process are specifically

harassment, restraint, or interference for their participation in the investigation and other phases of 
complaint processing.  

I have the right to be represented by a person of my choice during presentation of complaint and 
preparation of my statement (so long as my choice does not result in a conflict of interest).  I have 
[  ] have not [ x ] chosen a personal representative at this stage of my complaint.  In the event I 
have  not  chosen  a  representative  but  obtain  a  representative  at  a  later  date,  I  will  advise  the 
investigator and the Director of Civil Rights in writing. 

I have the right to review my statement prior to signing it and may make initialed corrections if it 
is  incomplete  or  inaccurate.  I  have  a  right  to  receive  a  copy  of  the  signed  statement.    Having 
reviewed the preceding information with the investigator, I solemnly swear [ ] affirm [ ] that the
