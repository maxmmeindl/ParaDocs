PURPOSE. The purpose of this Directive is to provide federal agencies with 
Commission policies, procedures, and guidance relating to the processing of 
employment discrimination complaints governed by the Commission’s regulations 
in 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  Federal agencies covered by 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 are 
responsible for developing and implementing their own equal employment 
programs, including alternative dispute resolution programs, and complaint 
processing procedures consistent with the Commission’s regulations.  It is the 
Commission’s responsibility to direct and further the implementation of the policy 
of the government of the United States to provide equal opportunity in federal 
employment and to prohibit discrimination in employment because of race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or retaliation.  
Pursuant to its obligations and statutory authority, the Commission issues such 
rules, regulations, orders, and instructions including management directives, as it 
deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities to communicate 
federal equal employment opportunity management policy, requirements, 
guidance and information to federal agencies.  The Commission’s instructions are 
directive in nature, and heads of federal agencies are responsible for prompt and 
effective compliance with Commission Management Directives and Bulletins.  
This complaint processing  manual will ensure that agency personnel responsible 
for complaints processing are in possession of all current Commission guidance 
materials so that the Commission’s policies, procedures, and regulations are 
consistently and uniformly applied government-wide.  The manual consists of 
several chapters with subject headings identified in the table of contents.  Some 
chapters are issued in connection with specific sections of the regulations.  Other 
chapters include guidance and direction on topics, which we know from our 
experience processing complaints under previous regulations, are needed and are 
applicable to Part 1614.  This manual will be supplemented by new and revised 
materials, as they are issued.  The Commission’s objective is for this manual to

2008, 42 U.S.C. § 2000ff10; Reorganization Plan No. 1, 3 C.F.R. § 321(1078) and

U.S.C. § 2000e note, issued in 1969 and 12106, 44 Fed. Reg. 1053 (1979). 

POLICY INTENT. The policy objective of this Directive is to ensure that federal 
personnel responsible for processing employment discrimination complaints do so

HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL SECTOR  
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMPLAINT PROCESS 

This  section  examines  the  history  of  the  federal  sector  equal  employment  opportunity  (EEO) 
complaint  process.    It  provides  an  overview  of  the  historical  authority  that  transferred  the 
responsibility for the  federal  sector  EEO process  from the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or the Commission).   

I. 

HISTORICAL AUTHORITY 

The Government first recognized a policy of nondiscrimination in federal employment during the 
1940s.  Specifically, in July 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued the first Executive Order to 
declare a policy of nondiscrimination in federal employment.1  Executive Order 9980 prohibited 
discrimination  in  federal  employment  on  the  bases  of  race,  color,  religion,  or  national  origin.2
Executive Order No. 9980, 13 Fed. Reg. 4,311 (July 28, 1948).  The Order designated the head 
of  each  department  to  be  personally  responsible  for  insuring  that  employment  decisions  were 
based “solely on merit and fitness,” and it required the head of  each department to designate a 
Fair  Employment  Officer  to  appraise  department  personnel  actions,  receive  discrimination 
complaints,  and  take  necessary  corrective  or  disciplinary  action.    Id.    The  Fair  Employment 
Officer’s  decisions  were  appealable  to  the  head  of  the  department.    Id.    Executive  Order  9980 
also  established  a  Fair  Employment  Board  (FEB)  in  the  CSC  to  advise  department  heads  on 
issues  related  to  fair  employment,  disseminate  information  relevant  to  fair  employment 
programs,  and  coordinate  department  programs.    Id.    The  FEB  was  authorized  “to  review 
decisions made by the head of any department which are appealed . . . or referred to the Board by 
the head of the department for advice, and to make recommendations to such head.”  Id.   

President  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  carried  forward  the  Government’s  nondiscrimination  policy 
when  he  issued  Executive  Order  10590,  which  superseded  Executive  Order  9980.    Executive 
Order  No.  10590,  20  Fed.  Reg.  409  (Jan.  19,  1955).    The  Order  required  each  department  or 
agency  head  to  establish  procedures  to  provide  a  complainant  with  a  fair  hearing  and  the 
opportunity to appeal their case.  Id.  Executive Order 10590 re-designated the Fair Employment 
Officer  as  an  Employment  Policy  Officer  and  abolished  the  FEB,  replacing  it  with  the 

1  In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, which prohibited government 
contractors from engaging in employment discrimination based on race, creed, color, or national origin.  
Executive Order No. 8802, 6 Fed. Reg. 3,109 (June 27, 1941).   

2 President Truman concurrently issued Executive Order 9981, which ordered desegregation of the U.S. 
Armed Forces.  Executive Order No. 9981, 13 Fed. Reg. 4,313 (July 26, 1948).

President’s Committee on Government Employment Policy.  Id.  The Committee’s authority was 
limited,  however,  to  reviewing  cases  and  rendering  advisory  opinions  to  the  agency  or 
department heads before issuance of a final agency action.  Id.    

In  March  1961,  President  John  F.  Kennedy  issued  Executive  Order  10925,  which  amended 
Executive  Order  10590.    Executive  Order  10925  replaced  the  President’s  Committee  on 
Government  Employment  Policy  with  the  President’s  Committee  on  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity.3
    Executive  Order  No.  10925,  26  Fed.  Reg.  1,977  (Mar.  8,  1961).    The  Order 
charged  this  new  committee  with  studying  federal  employment  practices  and  recommending 
additional  steps  to  fully  achieve  the  policy  of  nondiscrimination.    Id.    The  Committee  was 
empowered with the authority to impose sanctions for violations of the Executive Order.  Id.  

In  September  1965,  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  issued  Executive  Order  11246,  which 
superseded  Executive  Order  10590  but  retained  the  prohibition  on  discrimination  in  federal 
employment on the bases of race, color, creed, or national origin.  Executive Order No. 11246, 
30 Fed.  Reg.  12,319  (Sept.  28,  1965).    Notably,  Executive  Order  11246  returned  appellate 
review of final agency actions to the CSC and authorized the CSC to issue regulations and orders 
necessary to carry out its responsibilities.4
  Id.  The Order required each department and agency 
head to comply with the CSC’s procedures, and to establish and maintain a positive program of 
equal employment opportunity.  Id. 

In  August  1969,  President  Richard  Nixon  further  amended  Executive  Order  11246  by  issuing 
Executive Order 11478, which required department and agency heads to “establish and maintain 
an  affirmative  program  of  equal  employment  opportunity  for  all  civilian  employees  and 
applicants for employment.”  Executive Order No. 11478, 34 Fed. Reg. 12,985 (Aug. 12, 1969).  
President Nixon tasked the CSC with reviewing and evaluating agency programs.  Id.  Executive 
Order  11478  also  required  agencies  to  “provide  access  to  counseling  for  employees  who  feel 
aggrieved and . . . encourage the resolution of employee problems on an informal basis.”  Id.   

By  1970,  despite  the  issuance  of  numerous  Executive  Orders  addressing  nondiscrimination, 
employment  discrimination  remained  a  significant  problem  in  the  federal  government. 
Legislative  History  of  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Act  of  1972  (U.S.  Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C., H.R. 1746, Pub. L. No.. 92-261, 1972 at p. 1728 [hereinafter: 
Legislative History (1972)].  Congress did not find the administrative procedures established by 

3 Executive Order 10925 also added “creed” as a prohibited basis of discrimination and prohibited federal 
government  contractors  from  discriminating  on  account  of  race.    Executive  Order  No.  10925,  26  Fed. 
Reg. 1977 (Mar. 8, 1961). 

4 Executive Order 11246 also imposed nondiscrimination requirements on contractors and subcontractors 
as a condition of doing business with the federal government.  Executive Order No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 
12,319 (Sept. 28, 1965).

the CSC to be effective.  Id. at 82.  The CSC rarely reversed agency decisions and was criticized 
for failing to address systemic discrimination.  Id. at 82-84.  In addition, testimony presented to 
Congress  suggested  that  federal  employees  had  little  faith  in  the  complaint  process  and  often 
feared retaliation for challenging discriminatory employment practices.  Id. at 83.  Furthermore, 
Congress “found that inadequate remedies existed to make aggrieved persons whole,” including 
the unavailability of back pay as an administrative remedy and procedural obstacles potentially 
limiting the ability of federal employees to bring claims against the federal government, such as 
sovereign immunity.  Id.  As a result, Congress passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act 
of  1972,  which  amended  Title  VII  to  extend  its  coverage  to  include  federal  employees  while 
retaining the CSC’s role in the administrative process.5
   Id.  Additionally, Congress passed the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibited the federal government from discriminating against 
qualified  individuals  with  disabilities  and  required  federal  agencies  to  establish  affirmative 
action  programs  to  provide  greater  employment  opportunities  for  individuals  with  disabilities.   
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (1973). 

Despite the passage of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the Rehabilitation Act, there 
were  still  several  problems  with  the  federal  complaint/appeals  process.    The  CSC’s  procedural 
regulations  were  viewed  as  fundamentally  biased  against  complainants,  and  the  complaint 
process itself was difficult for individual complainants to navigate.  U.S. Department of Labor, 
Civil  Rights  Center,  To  Eliminate  Employment  Discrimination  (1975)).    Furthermore,  by  the 
1970s, seventeen federal agencies and departments were responsible for enforcing forty different 
nondiscrimination statutes and executive orders.  EEOC History: 35th Anniversary: 1965 – 2000: 
The  Law,  http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/index.html.    As  a  result,  in  1978, 
President Jimmy Carter submitted two reorganization plans to Congress to eliminate duplication 
and conflict by placing the responsibility for coordinating all federal EEO programs exclusively 
with the Commission.  Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 19,807 (May 5, 1978); 
Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 36,037 (Aug. 15, 1978). 

President  Carter  issued  Executive  Order  12067  to  implement  Reorganization  Plan  No.  1  and 
transfer the functions of the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council (EEOCC) to 
the EEOC.  Executive Order No. 12067, 43  Fed. Reg. 28,967 (Jan. 3, 1979).  Executive Order 
12067  delineated  the  Commission’s  responsibility  for  “develop[ing]  uniform  standards, 
guidelines,  and  policies”  for  promoting  and  furthering  equal  employment  opportunity  without 
regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.  Id.  Executive Order 12067 
required department and agency heads to comply with the Commission’s final rules, regulations, 
policies, procedures, and orders.  Id.  

5  In  1974,  Congress  amended  the  Equal  Pay  Act  (EPA)  and  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act 
(ADEA) to extend coverage to the federal sector.  P. Law No. 93-259, 88 Stat. 58 & 88 Stat. 74 (Apr. 8, 
1974).  Initially, the CSC was responsible for the enforcement of the EPA and the ADEA with respect to 
the federal sector.  Id.

After President Carter submitted his Reorganization Plans to Congress in 1978, Congress passed 
the  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  of  1978,  which  abolished  the  CSC  and  distributed  its  functions 
primarily  among  three  agencies:  the  EEOC;  a  newly  established  Office  of  Personnel 
Management (OPM); and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which replaced the CSC. 
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat 1111 (1978).  The Reorganization 
Plan  gave  the  Commission  responsibility  over  the  hearings  and  appeals  functions  for  certain 
cases  involving  employment  discrimination.    Id.    In  December  1978,  President  Carter  issued 
Executive  Order  12106,  which  transferred  additional  CSC  functions  to  the  Commission  and 
amended  Executive  Order  11478  by  adding  disability  and  age  as  protected  bases.    Executive 
Order  No.  12106,  44  Fed.  Reg.  1,053  (Jan.  3,  1979).    President  Carter  also  issued  Executive 
Orders 12107 implementing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and Reorganization Plan No. 
2. Executive Order No. 12107, 44 Fed. Reg. 1,055 (Jan. 3, 1979).  In June 1979, President Carter 
signed  Executive  Order  12144,  which  transferred  certain  equal  pay  and  age  discrimination 
enforcement  functions  to  the  Commission.    Executive  Order  No.  12144,  44  Fed.  Reg.  37,193 
(June 26, 1979). 

II. 

The Late 1970s-1980 

Prior to the Commission obtaining authority over the federal sector EEO process, the CSC had 
authority  to  issue  regulations  and  orders  with  respect  to  the  processing  of  federal  sector  EEO 
complaints.    As  a  result  of  Executive  Order  11246,  the  CSC  issued  its  initial  regulations 
pertaining to complaint processing at 5 C.F.R. Part 1613, effective April 3, 1966.  5 C.F.R. Part 
713  et  seq..    These  regulations  provided  time  frames  for  filing  complaints,  required  agency 
investigations,  a  hearing  by  an  agency  panel  or  an  agency  appointed  hearing  officer,  a  final 
decision by the agency head or a designee, and a process allowing complainants to file appeals 
with  the  CSC’s  Board  of  Appeals  and  Review.    Id.    After  President  Johnson  issued  Executive 
Order  11375,  in  October  1967,  which  prohibited  discrimination  in  federal  employment  on  the 
basis of sex,  the CSC amended its regulations  to  require  that  sex discrimination  complaints be 
processed the same as other EEO complaints.  Fed. Reg. 15,631 (Nov. 10, 1967).  In 1969, the 
CSC revised its regulations.  Significant changes to the regulations included: complainants were 
required to participate in informal counseling prior to filing a formal complaint, and complaints 
examiners  were  prohibited  from  being  employees  of  the  respondent  agency.    Id.    The  CSC 
subsequently amended its regulations several times between 1972 and 1979.   

When  the  Commission  gained  authority  over  the  CSC’s  functions  regarding  federal  sector 
employment  discrimination  in  1979,  it  decided  to  keep  the  existing  process  in  place  until  a 
detailed  study  could  be  completed.    EEOC  Adoption  and  Amendment  of  Civil  Service 
Commission  Federal  Employee  Discrimination  Complaint  Regulations,  43  Fed.  Reg.  60,900 
(Dec. 29, 1978).  Thus, the Commission adopted the CSC regulations with only minor technical 
changes.  43 Fed. Reg. 60,900 (Dec. 29, 1978).  The regulations were moved from 5 C.F.R. Part 
713 and re-designated at 29 C.F.R. Part 1613, effective Jan. 1, 1979.  Id. at 60,901.

In the early 1980s, the Commission amended its regulations with respect to the issue of remedies 
for complainants alleging discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.  Specifically, in 
October 1981, the Commission amended its regulations to authorize back pay to  applicants for 
federal employment  who successfully  proved disability discrimination in  order  to comply with 
the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Complaints of Handicap Discrimination 
in  the  Federal  Government,  46  Fed.  Reg.  51,384  (Oct.  20,  1981).    The  1978  amendments 
provided  that  prevailing  complainants  of  disability  discrimination  were  entitled  to  the  same 
remedies  as  those  provided  under  Title  VII.    Id.    The  Commission’s  amendments  deleted  the 
provision  in  the  regulations  prohibiting  back  pay  awards  to  applicants  aggrieved  by  disability 
discrimination.  Id.   

During  the  mid-1980s,  the  Commission  significantly  revised  its  regulations  governing  the 
processing  of  federal  sector  complaints.    Initially,  the  regulations  were  amended  in  1985,  to 
provide for a special panel to resolve conflicts between the MSPB and the Commission.  EEOC 
and  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  Regulations  for  Special  Panel  Proceedings,  50  Fed.  Reg. 
53,897  (Dec.  27,  1985).    Subpart  D,  “Processing  Mixed  Case  Complaints,”  was  amended  to 
provide for a means to refer cases to a special panel, the organization of the special panel, and 
the procedures of the panel.  Id.  Subsequently, the Commission revised its regulations, effective 
November  30,  1987.    1987  Revisions  to  Federal  Employee  Discrimination  Complaint 
Procedures,  52  Fed.  Reg.  41,920  (Oct.  30,  1987).    The  revised  regulations  encompassed 
numerous changes including providing additional grounds for dismissing complaints, as well as 
providing a right of appeal for complainants alleging breach of a settlement agreement.  Id.  In 
addition,  the  Commission  in  1987  renamed  complaints  examiners  “Administrative  Judges” 
(effective  March  30,  1987)  in  order  to  “reflect  more  accurately  the  nature  of  the  position.”  
Nomenclature Change to Federal Employee Discrimination Complaint Procedures, 52 Fed. Reg. 
10,085 (Mar. 30, 1987). 

III.  THE 1990s TO THE PRESENT 

The  1990s  also  represented  a  time  of  significant  change  to  the  Commission’s  regulations 
governing  the  processing  of  federal  sector  complaints.    The  Commission  issued  revised 
regulations  effective  October  1,  1992.    57  Fed.  Reg.  12,634  (Apr.  10,  1992).    These  revisions 
moved  the  regulations  from  29  C.F.R.  Part  1613  to  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614.    Id.    Part  1614  was 
organized  differently  than  the  prior  version  of  the  regulations.    Id.    Specifically,  Part  1613 
contained  separate  subparts  for  each  type  of  complaint  (Title  VII  complaints,  age  complaints, 
mixed case complaints, etc.).  Part 1614 consolidated the procedures as much as possible in an 
effort to avoid repetition.  Id.  One noteworthy change encompassed in the 1992 revisions was 
extending the time limit to contact an EEO Counselor from 30 days to 45 days.  Id. at 12,635. 

Pursuant to the recommendations of a Federal Sector Workgroup, comprised of representatives 
from  various  offices  throughout  the  EEOC,  the  Commission  revised  its  regulations  again  in 
1999, effective November 9, 1999.  1999 Revisions to EEOC Federal Employee Discrimination 

Management Directive

Complaint  Procedures,  64  Fed.  Reg.  37,644  (July  12,  1999)(codified  at  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614).  
Some of the significant changes to the regulations included: a requirement that agencies establish 
an alternative dispute resolution program, providing additional grounds for dismissal, providing 
Commission  Administrative  Judges  with  the  authority  to  dismiss  complaints,  and  making 
Administrative  Judge  decisions  final  decisions  without  potential  agency  modification.    Id.  at 
37,644-37,645;  37,650.    In  addition,  the  revised  regulations  implemented  changes  to  the 
provisions  governing  class  complaints  to  ensure  that  complaints  “raising  class  claims  are  not 
unjustifiably  denied  class  certification  and  are  resolved  under  the  appropriate  legal  standards 
consistent” with the federal courts.  Id. at 37,651.  Moreover, the Commission issued guidance 
regarding its new regulations in EEO Management Directive-110 (MD-110) (Nov. 9, 1999).   

In  1992,  Congress  amended  Section  501  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  to  adopt  the  employment 
nondiscrimination standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  67 Fed. Reg. 35,732 
(May 21, 2002).  Effective June 20, 2002, the Commission deleted from its regulations the text 
of  its  old  Section  501  regulation,  at  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.203.    Id.    The  new  text  of  §  1614.203 
provides,  in  pertinent  part,  that  the  standards  used  to  determine  whether  Section  501  of  the 
Rehabilitation Act has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination shall be 
the standards applied under the ADA.  67 Fed. Reg. 35,735 (May 21, 2002). 

In  an  effort  to  clarify  its  procedures  on  mixed  case  complaints,  the  Commission  issued  EEO 
Management  Bulletin  100-1  (EEO  MB  100-1)  on  October  24,  2003.    This  bulletin  advises 
agencies to  delete  from their copies of EEO MD-110 Section  II.B.4.d in  Chapter 4.    EEO-MB 
100-1  (Oct.  24,  2003).    This  section  advised  agency  representatives  to  file  a  motion  with  an 
MSPB  Administrative Judge  to  consolidate  matters  that  were  not  within  their  jurisdiction  with 
matters that were properly before the MSPB Administrative Judge.  Id.  The MSPB notified the 
Commission  that  this  section  was  improper  because  it  constituted  a  request  for  an  MSPB 
Administrative Judge to hear matters that may not be within the jurisdiction of the MSPB.  Id. 

In  2004,  the  process  that  led  to  the  current  regulatory  revisions  began  when  the  Commission 
created  a  workgroup  to  develop  consensus  recommendations  from  the  Commissioners  for 
improvements  to  the  federal  sector  EEO  complaint  process.    The  workgroup  considered  a 
number of items including testimony and submissions from a November 12, 2002, Commission 
meeting  on  federal  sector  reform,  staff  proposals,  and  submissions  from  internal  and  external 
stakeholders  including  the  National  Employment  Lawyers  Association  and  the  Commission’s 
union.  The workgroup determined that while there was no consensus among the Commissioners 
for  large-scale  revision  of  the  federal  sector  EEO  process,  there  was  agreement  on  several 
discrete  changes  to  the  existing  regulations  that  would  clarify  or  build  on  the  1999  Part  1614 
revisions. 

Based  on  the  workgroup’s  recommendations,  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM)  was 
drafted  that amended  certain sections of 29  C.F.R. 1614.   The  Commission  approved  the draft 
NPRM on June 2, 2008, circulated it to federal agencies on June 4, 2008, pursuant to Executive 
Order 12067, and gave agencies two months to submit comments.  Thirty-three (33) agencies or 

Management Directive 
P-vi

EEO MD-110 

agency  components  submitted  comments.    After  coordination  with  the  Office  of  Management 
and Budget (OMB) and the commenting agencies, the Commission formally submitted the draft 
NPRM to OMB for review under Executive Order 12866 on July 27, 2009. 

The  Commission  approved  the  NPRM  on  December  9,  2009,  and  published  it  in  the  Federal 
Register  on  December  21,  2009.    The  Commission  received  35  public  comments:  14  from 
federal agencies; 6 from individuals; 5 from civil rights groups; 5 from members of the bar; and 
5 from unions or other groups.  The Commission issued the Final Rule,  with public comments 
discussed in the preamble, on July 25, 2012. 

The final rule contains a number of key revisions to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614: 

  As part of  the Commission’s authority to review agency  programs for compliance with 
Commission directives and guidelines that promote equal employment opportunity in the 
federal workplace, the Commission can issue notices to agencies when non-compliance is 
found and not corrected.   

  Agencies can seek approval from the Commission to conduct pilot projects in which the 

complaint processing procedures vary from the requirements of Part 1614. 

  A complaint that alleges that a proposal or preliminary step to taking a personnel action is 
discriminatory  can  be  dismissed,  unless  the  complainant  alleges  that  the  proposal  is 
retaliatory. 

  An agency that has  not  completed its investigation in a  timely manner  must inform the 
complainant in writing that the investigation is not complete, provide an estimated date of 
completion, and remind the complainant that s/he has a current right to request a hearing 
or file a lawsuit. 

  An Administrative Judge’s decision on the merits of a class complaint is a final decision, 

rather than a recommended decision, which an agency can implement or appeal. 

  Agencies must submit appeals and complaint files to the Commission in a digital format, 
unless they can establish good cause for not doing so.  Complainants are encouraged to 
submit digital filings. 

The rule also required that the Commission provide guidance regarding the changes made by the 
final rule and continue to assess the federal sector EEO complaint process with a view to further 
improvements. 

The  Commission  is  now  in  the  process  of  considering  more  significant  changes  to  the  federal 
sector  complaint  process  than  those  issued  in  the  Final  Rule  adopted  in  2012.    An  Advanced 
Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (ANPRM)  was  issued  in  Feb.  2015  asking  federal  agencies,

August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

employees  and  the  public  to  consider  how  the  Commission’s  federal  sector  complaint  process 
currently  works  and  whether  wholesale  revisions  to  the  process  are  needed.    The  Commission 
received  approximately  100  comments  in  response.    After  review  of  those  comments,  the 
Commission  intends  to  issue  a  NPRM  to  amend  the  1614  regulations.    A  final  revised  1614 
regulation  may  incorporate  changes  to  the  processing  of  complaints  and  therefore  to  MD-110.  
Nonetheless,  because  the  2012  Final  Rule  is  already  in  effect  and  there  is  a  need  to  provide 
agencies  with  guidance  on  how  to  implement  important  changes  made  in  that  rule,  the 
Commission believes it is necessary to issue this revised MD-110.

CHAPTER 1 
U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND AGENCY 
AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY 

I. 

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION 

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the Commission) enforces five federal 
laws that prohibit employment discrimination against applicants for federal employment, 
current federal employees, or former federal employees: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964, as amended (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, 
or national origin); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (prohibiting agencies from paying different 
wages  to  men  and  women  performing  equal  work  in  the  same  work  place);  the  Age 
Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  of  1967,  as  amended  (prohibiting  discrimination 
against persons age 40 or older); Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
as  amended  (prohibiting  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability);  and  Title  II  of  the 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (prohibiting discrimination based on 
genetic information). 

The Commission provides leadership and guidance to federal agencies on all aspects of 
the  federal  government’s  equal  employment  opportunity  program.    The  Commission 
ensures  federal  agency  and  department  compliance  with  Commission  regulations, 
provides technical assistance to federal agencies concerning EEO complaint adjudication, 
monitors and evaluates federal agencies’ affirmative employment programs, develops and 
distributes  federal  sector  educational  materials  and  conducts  training  for  stakeholders, 
provides guidance and assistance to our Administrative Judges who conduct hearings on 
EEO complaints, and adjudicates appeals from administrative decisions made by federal 
agencies on EEO complaints.   

To carry out these duties, the Commission is authorized to issue rules, regulations, orders, 
and  instructions  governing  the  federal  sector  pursuant  to  Section  717(b) of  Title  VII  of 
the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-16(b);  Section  15(b)  of  the  Age 
Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  of  1967,  29 U.S.C.  §  633a(b);  Section  505(a)(1)  of 
the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29 U.S.C.  §  794a(a)(1);  the  Genetic  Information 
Nondiscrimination  Act  of  2008,  42 U.S.C.  §  2000ff10;  the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act, 
29 U.S.C.  §  201  et  seq.;  Section  303  of  the  Notification  and  Federal  Employee 
Antidiscrimination  and  Retaliation  Act  of  2002  (No  FEAR  Act),  Pub.  L.  No.  107-174; 
Executive  Order  12067,  43  Fed.  Reg.  28,967  (June  30,  1978);  and  Executive  Order 
11478, 34 Fed. Reg. 12,985 (Aug. 8, 1969), as amended by Executive Order 12106 (Dec. 
28, 1978).  It is pursuant to these authorities that the Commission issues this Management 
Directive. 

Management Directive 
1-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  furtherance  of  its  mission,  to  stop  and  remedy  unlawful  employment  discrimination, 
the  Commission  will  from  time  to  time  review  agency  programs  and  provide  guidance 
regarding  whether  they  are  in  compliance  with  the  Commission’s  rules,  regulations, 
orders, management directives, management bulletins, and any other instructions issued 
by the Commission.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(e).  It is the intent of the Commission to 
assist agencies in perfecting their EEO programs and to avoid or rectify any deficiencies 
in their programs that prevent them from reaching the statutory mandate of being model 
workplaces free from unlawful discrimination. 

II. 

FEDERAL AGENCY 

In this Management Directive the term 

“Federal  Agency”  or  “Agency,”  refers  to  military  departments  as  defined  in 
5 U.S.C. § 102, executive agencies as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 105, the U.S. Postal 
Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the 
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  Commissioned  Corps,  the 
Government Printing Office (except for complaints under the Rehabilitation Act), 
and the Smithsonian Institution.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.103(b).  The term also may 
include such other agencies, administrations, or bureaus (sub-components) as may 
be  established  within  the  above-listed  that  are  given  the  authority  to  establish  a 
separate  unit  tasked  with  implementing  an  agency  program  consistent  with  the 
requirements of 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102.   

Federal agencies are required by statute not to engage in discrimination on the bases of 
race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic  information,  or 
retaliation.    They  are  also  responsible  for  providing  any  reasonable  accommodations 
throughout the EEO process for the aggrieved/complainant.  A federal employee, former 
employee, or job applicant who believes s/he was discriminated against has a right to file 
a complaint with the agency’s office responsible for its EEO programs.  Federal agencies 
must offer pre-complaint counseling or EEO alternative dispute resolution (EEO ADR) to 
individuals  who  allege  that  they  were  discriminated  against  by  the  agency.    If  pre-
complaint counseling or EEO ADR does not resolve the dispute(s), the individual can file 
a  formal  discrimination  complaint  with  the  agency’s  EEO  office.    The  agency  may 
dismiss the complaint for certain procedural reasons or conduct an investigation.  At the 
conclusion  of  the  investigation,  the  agency  will  issue  a  notice  that  provides  the 
complainant  with  the  option  of  either  requesting  a  hearing  before  a  Commission 
Administrative  Judge  or  having  the  agency  issue  a  final  agency  decision.    The  final 
agency  action  can  be  appealed  to  the  Commission,  or  the  complainant  may  file  a  civil 
action in a U.S. District Court.  The authority the agency has to investigate and resolve 
complaints  of  discrimination  stems  from  the  statutory  obligation  that  states  that  federal 

Management Directive 
1-2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

agencies  have  the  primary  responsibility  to  ensure  nondiscrimination  in  employment.   
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(e). 

In this Management Directive, the term  

“Final  Agency  Action”  refers  to  an  agency’s  last  and  final  action  on  a 
complaint of employment discrimination.  The final agency action may be 
in the form of a final agency decision, a final agency order implementing 
an Administrative Judge’s decision, or a final determination on a breach of 
settlement agreement claim. 

“Final  Agency  Decision”  refers  to  a  decision  on  a  complaint  of 
discrimination made by the agency, without an Administrative Judge, that 
is appealable to the Commission.  It includes agency decisions to dismiss 
or agency decisions on the merits. 

“Final Agency Order” refers to a decision by an agency to implement or 
not implement an Administrative Judge’s decision, which is appealable to 
the Commission.  Where the agency’s final order does not fully implement 
the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision,  the  agency  must  simultaneously 
appeal to the Commission. 

“Final  Agency  Determination”  refers  to  an  agency  determination  as  to 
whether there was a breach of a settlement agreement that is appealable to 
the Commission. 

In  light  of  the  significant  responsibility  agencies  have  for  ensuring  the  integrity  of  the 
EEO  process,  agency  programs  must  comply  with  the  rules,  regulations,  orders,  and 
instructions  issued  by  the  Commission  to  ensure  that  complaints  of  employment 
discrimination are resolved fairly and quickly.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(e) clearly sets forth 
both the authority of the Commission over the federal sector EEO programs and the duty 
of federal agencies to maintain EEO programs in a manner consistent with the mandatory 
directives of the Commission.

III.  EEO DIRECTOR’S INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY AND REPORTING 

RELATIONSHIPS 

In this Management Directive the term 

“EEO Director” - refers to the Director of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, 
Director  of  Civil  Rights,  EEO  Officer,  or  any  other  title  used  for  the  position  that  is 
responsible for carrying out the responsibilities set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(c). 

Federal Agencies Must Appoint an EEO Director Who Shall Be Responsible for - 

A. 
See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(c): 

1. 

2. 

3. 

implementing  continuing  affirmative  employment  programs  to  promote 
equal  employment  opportunity,  see  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.102(c)(1),  and 
Commission  issued  Directives  and  Guidance  (such  as  MD-715  and  its 
Instructions) for specific information; 

identifying  and  eliminating  discriminatory  employment  practices  and 
policies, including the counseling of individuals and the fair and impartial 
investigations of complaints; and 

advising  the  agency  head  on  matters  related  to  equal  employment 
opportunity. 

B. 

The EEO Director Must Report Directly to the Agency Head 

To ensure that federal agencies achieve their goal of being a model workplace, all 
managers and employees must view/consider equal employment opportunity as an 
integral  part  of  the  agency’s  strategic  mission.    Commission  regulations  require 
that the EEO Director “be under the immediate supervision of the agency head.”  
29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(b)(4).  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the 
EEO  Director  has  the  access  and  authority  to  ensure  that  the  agency  truly 
considers the elimination of workplace discrimination to be a fundamental aspect 
of the agency’s mission. 

Where such sub-components are authorized, the EEO Director shall be under the 
immediate  supervision  of  the  head  of  the  sub-component.    The  sub-component 
EEO  Director  may,  in  the  alternative,  report  to  either  the  EEO  Director  of  the 
parent organization or to the head of the parent organization. 

In  order  to  maintain  and  exercise  the  independent  authority  required  of  the 
position, the EEO Director cannot be placed under the supervision of the agency’s 
Chief  Human  Capital  Officer  or  other  officials  responsible  for  executing  and 

Management Directive 
1-4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

advising  on  personnel  actions  or  providing  the  agency  with  a  legal  defense  to 
claims of discrimination, such as the Office of General Counsel. 

By placing the EEO Director under the immediate supervision of the head of the 
agency, the agency underscores the importance of equal employment opportunity 
to the mission of each federal agency and ensures that the EEO Director is able to 
act with the greatest degree of independence.   

This unfettered relationship allows the agency head to have a clear understanding 
of EEO factors when making organizational decisions.  Placing the EEO Director 
under  the  authority  of  others  within  the  agency  may  undermine  the  EEO 
Director=s independence, especially where the person or entity to which the EEO 
Director reports is involved in, or  would be  affected by, the actions of the EEO 
Director in the performance of his/her implementation of the agency program set 
forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102. 

IV.  AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

Federal  agencies  have  a  unique  role  to  play  in  ensuring  equal  employment  opportunity.    First, 
every  agency  head  has  a  statutory  obligation  to  eradicate  unlawful  employment  discrimination 
that may occur within the agency.  This anti-discrimination responsibility is what requires federal 
agencies  to  administer  a  fair  and  impartial  investigative  process  designed  to  determine  the 
validity  of  complaints,  as  well  as  to  employ  affirmative  efforts  to  root  out  discrimination  and 
ensure  equal  employment  opportunity.    The  agency  head  designates  the  Director  of  the  Office 
responsible for the agency’s EEO programs to carry out this obligation. 

At the same time, the agency head has a fiduciary obligation to defend the agency against legal 
challenges  brought  against  it  (agency  defensive  function),  including  charges  of  discrimination.   
The agency head designates the General Counsel of the agency (or an agency representative) to 
carry out this obligation. 

In this Management Directive, the term  

“Agency  Representative”  refers  to  any  or  all  agency  employees,  (for  example 
Defense  Counsel,  agency  counsel,  or  legal  representative),  whose  job  duties 
include defending the agency’s personnel policies and/or actions.  The term is not 
limited to attorneys employed in an agency’s Office of General Counsel or Office 
of  Legal  Counsel.    The  term  also  includes  attorneys  in  the  Office  of  Human 
Capital  and  non-attorney  employees  whose  job  duties  include  defending  the 
agency’s  personnel  policies  and/or  actions,  for  example, 
labor  relations 
specialists. 

Management Directive 
1-5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some  may  view  the  agency’s  investigative  process  as  inherently  biased  because  the  agency 
accused  of  discrimination  is  the  same  agency  that  is  charged  with  administering  the  EEO 
investigative  process.    Nevertheless,  the  statute  requires  that  an  agency  comply  with  rules, 
regulations,  orders  and  instructions  which  shall  include  the  issuance  of  a  “final  action”  on  a 
complaint  of  discrimination,  and  Commission  regulations  establish  a  comprehensive  system 
through which agencies must issue these final agency actions.  Moreover, as the Commission’s 
regulations  make  clear,  and  as  this  management  directive  reinforces,  a  federal  agency  head  is 
obligated to protect both the integrity of the agency’s EEO process and the legal interests of the 
agency. 

It  is  important  to  reiterate  that  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  final  agency  action,  the  agency  is 
responsible  for  the  fair,  impartial  processing  and  resolution  of  complaints  of  employment 
discrimination.    Because  the  agency  carries  this  responsibility  of  impartially  processing 
discrimination complaints, conflicts of interest can arise when agency representatives in offices, 
programs, or divisions within the agency with a legal defensive role play a part in the impartial 
processing.    This  does  not  mean  that  any  involvement  in  the  EEO  process  by  the  Office  of 
General  Counsel  or  Office  of  Human  Capital  automatically  creates  a  potential  conflict,  but 
instead refers to impermissible involvement in the EEO process by those employees or units of 
employees  designated  to  represent  the  agency  in  adversarial  proceedings.    See  Complainant  v. 
Dep’t.  of  Defense,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120084008  (June  6,  2014)  (finding  that  an  agency 
representative  should  not  interfere  with  the  development  of  the  EEO  investigative  record  by 
“us[ing] the power of its office to intimidate a complainant or her witnesses”); see also Rucker v. 
Dep’t. of the Treasury, EEOC Appeal No. 0120082225 (Feb. 4, 2011) (stating an agency “should 
be careful to avoid even the appearance that it is interfering with the EEO process.”   

While the information in the following sections illustrates the conflicts that may compromise the 
integrity  of  the  impartial  EEO  complaint  process,  it  is  not  intended  to  imply  that  agency 
representatives  are  a  negative  influence  on  the  process.    Many  agency  representatives  provide 
meaningful  contributions  to  the  EEO  in  the  workplace  by  educating  managers  and  employees, 
consulting  senior  leaders  with  lessons  learned  from  workplace  disputes,  and  seeking  to  protect 
the  agency  by  advising  leadership  to  end  a  discriminatory  practice  as  soon  as  it  becomes 
apparent.  This section focuses on the narrow occasions where the intersection of responsibilities 
creates a conflict affecting the impartiality of the complaint process. 

A. 

Separation of EEO Complaint Program from the Agency’s Personnel Function 

to  promote  equal  opportunity  and 

The  EEO  complaint  program  is  an  integral  part  of  the  agency’s  “affirmative 
program 
identify  and  eliminate 
discriminatory  practices  and  policies.”    See  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.102(a).    To  carry 
out this function in an impartial manner, the agency’s personnel function must be 
kept  separate  from  the  EEO  complaint  process.    The  same  agency  official(s) 
responsible  for  executing  and  advising  on  personnel  actions  may  not  also  be 
responsible  for  managing,  advising,  or  overseeing  the  EEO  pre-complaint  or 

to 

Management Directive 
1-6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

complaint  processes.    The  EEO  processes  often  scrutinize  and  challenge  the 
motivations and impacts of personnel actions and decisions.  In order to maintain 
the integrity of the EEO investigative and decision-making processes, those EEO 
functions must be kept separate from the personnel function.  

B. 

Complaints That Present Potential Conflicts of Interest 

1.  When  the  Alleged  Responsible  Management  Official  Is  the  Head  of 

the Agency 

A conflict of interest may exist when the responsible management official 
alleged to have engaged in discriminatory conduct is the agency head or a 
member  of  the  immediate  staff  of  the  agency  head,  or  occupies  a  high-
level position of influence in the agency.  Real or perceived conflict may 
occur  as  a  result  of  the  undue  influence  that  the  high-level  official  may 
have  over  the  EEO  Director  and  other  involved  agency  personnel.  
Whether  this  conflict  is  real  or  presents  the  appearance  of  a  conflict,  the 
matter  must  be  addressed  through  procedures  designed  to  safeguard  the 
integrity  of  the  EEO  complaint  process.    For  example,  when  an  EEO 
complaint alleges that the agency head or a member of his/her immediate 
staff  has  engaged  in  discrimination,  the  agency  head  should  recuse 
himself/herself from the  decision-making process, and engage  an  official 
outside  his/her  chain  of  command  to  issue  a  final  action  on  the  case.  
Agencies with questions regarding unique conflict issues may contact the 
Office of Federal Operations (OFO) for additional guidance. 

2.  When  the  Alleged  Responsible  Management  Official  Is  the  EEO 

Director or Supervisor in the EEO Office 

If  an  employee wishes  to  file  a  complaint  alleging  discrimination  by  the 
EEO Director or another supervisor in the EEO office, a real or perceived 
conflict  may  exist  because  the  interests  of  the  responding  official  would 
challenge the objectivity or perceived objectivity of the EEO office.  This 
matter  must  be  addressed  through  procedures  designed  to  safeguard  the 
integrity  of  the  EEO  complaint  process.    For  example,  when  an  EEO 
complaint alleges that the EEO Director or a member of his/her immediate 
staff  discriminated,  the  EEO  Director  shall  recuse  himself/herself  and 
retain a third party to conduct the counseling, and investigation and draft 
the final agency decision for the agency head to issue. 

Management Directive 
1-7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. 

Agencies Must Avoid Conflicts of Interest in Processing Complaints 

Agencies  are  required to  develop an  impartial factual record in  accordance with 
the  instructions  contained  in  this  Management  Directive.    See  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(b).    Therefore,  agencies  must  develop  procedures  for  investigating 
complaints in which it is perceived that the EEO office would have  an actual or 
perceived conflict of interest.  In developing an impartial record where a conflict 
of  interest  or  the  appearance  of  a  conflict  exists,  agencies  should  consider  the 
following: 

1. 

Formal or Informal Arrangements 

Agencies should consider whether the EEO program would be best served 
by  entering  into  a  formal  contract  with  a  third  party  or  whether  an 
informal arrangement with a third party would suffice.  When establishing 
a  formal  contract,  many  agencies  enter  into  interagency  agreements  with 
other  agencies  to  handle  one  or  more  of  the  stages  in  the  EEO  process.   
See  Appendix  A  for  a  sample  Interagency  Agreement.    Other  agencies 
have  developed  informal  arrangements  with  a  third  party,  whereby  the 
third party provides EEO services on an as-needed basis. 

Agencies  should  consider  the  best  source  from  which  to  obtain  a  third 
party.    Agencies  have  reported  using  private  contractors,  parallel  sub-
components  within  a  department  or  agency,  and  other  federal  agencies.  
The Commission does not endorse any particular type of third party over 
any other.  However, agencies should ensure that the third party adheres to 
the applicable requirements established in this Management Directive. 

2.  Stages of the EEO Process 

third  party 

Agencies should assess the stages of the EEO complaint process at which 
the  assistance  of  a  third  party  would  be  most  effective.    Many  agencies 
the  responsibility  of  providing  counseling, 
assign  a 
administering EEO ADR, conducting the investigation, and/or writing the 
accept/dismiss letter and/or the final agency action.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 
§  1614.110(a),  the  agency  is  responsible  for  issuing  a  final  order  either 
fully  implementing  an  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  or  not  fully 
implementing and appealing the Administrative Judge’s decision; pursuant 
to  29  C.F.R.  §1614.110(b),  the  agency  is  responsible  for  taking  final 
action  by  issuing  a  final  agency  decision  (FAD).    Although  the  agency 
must  issue  the  final  action,  it  may  assign  a  third  party  to  write  the  final 
action and review the final action before issuance.

D. 

Separation of EEO Complaint Program from Agency’s Defensive Function 

Heads  of  agencies  must  manage  the  dual  obligations  of  carrying  out  fair  and 
impartial investigations of complaints that result in final agency determinations as 
to whether  discrimination has  occurred  and  defending  the  agency against claims 
of  employment  discrimination.    Only  through  the  vigilant  separation  of  the 
investigative and defensive functions can this inherent tension be managed.  

Ensuring a clear separation between the agency’s EEO complaint program and the 
agency’s  defensive  function  is  thus  the  essential  underpinning  of  a  fair  and 
impartial  investigation,  enhancing  the  credibility  of  the  EEO  office  and  the 
integrity of the EEO complaints process.   

There  must  be  a  firewall  between  the  EEO  function  and  the  agency’s  defensive 
function.    The  firewall  will  ensure  that  actions  taken  by  the  agency  to  protect 
itself  from  legal  liability  will  not  negatively  influence  or  affect  the  agency’s 
process  for  determining  whether  discrimination  has  occurred  and,  if  such 
discrimination did occur, for remedying it at the earliest stage possible.   

It is important for the EEO Director to be provided with sufficient legal resources 
(either  directly  or  through  contracts)  so  that  the  legal  analyses  necessary  for 
reaching final agency decisions can be made within the autonomous EEO office. 

At  a  minimum,  however,  the  agency  representative  in  EEO  complaints  may  not 
conduct legal sufficiency reviews of EEO matters.  Legal sufficiency reviews in 
the  EEO  process  involve  legal  analysis  made  by  the  EEO  office  during  the 
processing of EEO complaints, such as acceptance/dismissal of complaints, legal 
theories utilized by the EEO office during investigations, and legal determinations 
made in final agency actions.  The optimal situation is for the EEO office to have 
sufficient  internal  legal  resources.    However,  when  necessary  and  requested  by 
the EEO office, legal sufficiency reviews conducted outside the EEO office must 
be handled by individuals that are separate and apart from the agency’s defensive 
function.   

Similarly, impartiality or the appearance of impartiality is not ensured by simply 
rotating  agency  representatives  within  the  same  office  and  is  undermined  where 
the agency representative’s associates are assigned the legal sufficiency function 
in EEO cases from the representative’s caseload.   

Management Directive 
1-9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. 

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES 

The agency must designate an individual to attend settlement discussions convened by a 
Commission Administrative Judge or to participate in EEO alternative dispute resolution 
(ADR) attempts.  Agencies should include an official with settlement authority during all 
settlement discussions and at  all EEO ADR meetings (Note: The agency’s official with 
settlement authority should not be the responsible management official or agency official 
directly  involved  in  the  case.    This  is  not  a  general  prohibition  on  those  officials  from 
being  present  at  appropriate  settlement  discussions  and  participating,  only  that  they  are 
not the officials with the settlement authority.)  The probability of achieving resolution of 
a  dispute  improves  significantly  if  the  designated  agency  official  has  the  authority  to 
agree  immediately  to  a  resolution  reached  between  the  parties.    If  an  official  with 
settlement  authority  is  not  present  at  the  settlement  or  EEO  ADR  negotiations,  such 
official  must  be  immediately  accessible  to  the  agency  representative  during  settlement 
discussions or EEO ADR.   

VI.  EEO OFFICIALS CANNOT SERVE AS REPRESENTATIVES  

EEO  officials  must  have  the  confidence  of  the  agency  and  its  employees.    It  is 
inconsistent  with  their  neutral  roles  for  EEO  Counselors,  EEO  Investigators,  EEO 
Program Managers, or EEO Directors to represent agencies or complainants in the EEO 
complaint process.  Therefore, persons in these positions cannot serve as representatives 
for  complainants  or  for  agencies  in  connection  with  the  processing  of  discrimination 
complaints.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.605(c) (disqualification of representatives for conflict 
of duties).   

VII.  SPECIAL EMPHASIS PROGRAM  

The head of the agency shall designate an  Equal Employment Opportunity Officer(s) and 
such Special Emphasis Program Managers, clerical, and administrative support as may be 
necessary to carry out the functions described in Part 1614 in all organizational units of 
the agency and at all agency installations.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(b)(4). 

Special  Emphasis  Program  Managers  should  include  managers  of  the  Program  for 
Employees  with  Disabilities,  the  Federal  Women's  Program,  the  Hispanic  Employment 
Program  and  such  other  programs  as  may  be  required  by  the  Office  of  Personnel 
Management or the particular agency.   

An  agency  head  may  delegate  authority  under  this  part  to  one  or  more  designees.

IX.  PROGRAM REVIEW PROCEDURES FOR COMPLIANCE 

Agency  programs will be reviewed  for compliance with  Commission rules, regulations, 
orders, Management Directives, Management  Bulletins, or any other instructions issued 
by  the  Commission.    Due  to  the  variation  in  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  above 
issuances the method of review may vary, depending on the requirement(s) at issue.  A 
review  may  result  from  multiple  sources:  1)  monitoring  agency  submissions  including 
complaint  files,  plans,  and  reports;  2)  monitoring  correspondence  and  news  media  for 
reports of agency action or non-action indicative of compliant or noncompliant activity; 
3)  requesting  information  directly  from  the  agency;  and  4)  on-site  visits  or  virtual 
conferences.   

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(e), in cases where any of an agency’s EEO programs or 
activities are found not to be in compliance with a Commission issuance, the agency will 
be  notified  of  such  non-compliance,  and  the  agency  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to 
respond  to  the  Commission.    The  agency’s  response  should  contain  a  statement  of  the 
agency’s  compliance,  a  plan  to  bring  the  program  or  activity  into  compliance,  or  a 
justification as to why the agency will not comply.  Failure to respond or an inadequate 
agency response will result in escalation to the next step in this process. 

A. 

Notice to Agency of Non-Compliance 

In  cases  where  noncompliance  is  discovered,  the  agency  EEO  Director  or 
responsible  Program  Manager  will  be  notified  in  writing  of  the  noncompliance.   
The notice will include:  

1) 

2) 

3) 

the  requirement  with  which  the  Commission  believes  that  the  agency  is 
not in compliance and the source of that requirement;  

a  statement  explaining  how  the  Commission  became  aware  of  the 
noncompliance;  

a  statement  as  to  how  the  agency  is  not  in  compliance  and  the  basis  for 
that conclusion;

5) 

a  stated  reasonable  period  of  time  to  cure  the  noncompliance  with 
recommended actions; and  

a stated reasonable period of time in which the agency may establish that 
it  is,  in  fact,  in  compliance  or  a  stated  reasonable  period  of  time  to 
establish a justification for the noncompliance.   

B.  Written Notice to Head of Federal Agency 

The Chair of the Commission may issue a notice to the head of the agency whose 
program  is  noncompliant  when  an  agency  head  fails  to  be  responsive  and/or 
where  efforts  to  assist  the  agency  in  reaching  compliance  through  the  steps  set 
forth in Section IX.A.  The notice to the agency head will include:  

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

5) 

the  compliance  requirement  with  which  the  Commission  believes  the 
agency is not complying and the source of that compliance requirement; 

a  statement  explaining  how  the  Commission  became  aware  of  the 
noncompliance;  

the efforts undertaken by the Commission’s Office of Federal Operations 
to obtain compliance;   

the agency response to the Commission’s efforts; and 

a stated period of time within which the agency head must respond with a 
plan to bring the program into compliance. 

C. 

Public Notification of Non-Compliance 

Where  the  head  of  the  agency  fails  to  respond  timely  and  in  good  faith  with  a 
plan  that  the  Director  of  Federal  Operations  believes  is  sufficient  to  bring  the 
agency  program  into  compliance,  the  Chair  of  the  Commission  will  publically 
identify  the  noncompliant  agency  and  the  factual  bases  surrounding  the 
noncompliance. 

1. 

The  Chair  will  evaluate  the  repercussions  and  reach  of  the  effect  of  the 
noncompliance  on  equal  employment  opportunity  and  publish  or 
publically identify the fact of noncompliance in a manner reflective of the 
reach and severity of the harm.

PILOT PROJECTS 

Unless  prohibited  by  law  or  executive  order,  the  Commission,  in  its  discretion  and  for 
good  cause  shown,  may  grant  agencies  prospective  variances  from  the  complaint 
processing procedures prescribed in 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  Variances will permit agencies 
to conduct pilot projects of proposed changes to the complaint processing requirements of 
29 C.F.R. Part 1614 that may later be made permanent through regulatory change.  See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(f). 

A. 

Request for Pilot Authority  

Agencies requesting variances must submit in writing a request for pilot authority.  In its 
written request, the agency requesting a variance must:

and how data will be collected for evaluation purposes.   

B. 

Process for Submitting, Reviewing, and Approving Pilot Projects  

The Commission will annually review and evaluate requests for pilot authority.  Agencies 
should  submit  their  request  electronically  at  the  end  of  the  second  quarter  of  the  fiscal 
year, and the Commission will make its determination by the end of the third quarter.  All 
approved pilot projects will begin at the beginning of the next fiscal year and terminate 
not more than 24 months later, unless extended (see below).  The process for approval of 
pilot authority follows:

8. 

The  Commission  announces  the  opening  period  of  the  request  for  pilot 
authority at the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year (March 31). 

Agencies submit requests to the Office of Federal Operations by April 15. 

The  Office  of  Federal  Operations  reviews  requests  and  makes 
recommendations (completed by May 15). 

The Office of Federal Operations submits requests and recommendations 
to the Commission by May 15. 

The  Commission  review,  including  a  briefing  period  regarding  the 
requests  for  variances  and  recommendations  from  the  Office  of  Federal 
Operations, will be completed within 30 days (or by June 15). 

The Commission votes on approval of requests for pilot authorities. 

The  Office  of  Federal  Operations  sends  Commission  determinations  to 
proposing agencies. 

Pilot projects must begin the first day of the next fiscal year (October 1).

11. 

The 24-month maximum time frame for pilot projects will permit agencies 
to accept complaints into the pilot projects for up to 24 months and allow 
agencies a reasonable amount of time to conclude the processing of those 
complaints. 

Agencies administering pilot projects must submit quarterly reports to the 
Office  of  Federal  Operations  with  information  on  the  total  complainants 
opting into the pilot project, the average age of complaints with the pilot 
project, and updated pilot project evaluation data.  See Section X.A.10 of 
this Chapter. 

Agencies administering pilot projects must submit a final evaluation report 
at the conclusion of the pilot project.  The report must provide a detailed 
evaluation  of  the  results  of  the  pilot  project  and  be  submitted  to  the 
Commission within 90 days of the conclusion of the pilot project. 

Variances  will  not  be  granted  for  individual  cases  and  will  usually  not  be  granted  for 
more than 24 months.  The Director of the Office of Federal Operations for good cause 
shown may grant requests for extensions of variances for up to an additional 12 months.  
Additionally, the Director of the Office of Federal Operations may terminate an agency’s 
pilot authority if the agency fails to comply with the requirements of the variance.  Prior 
to termination of the pilot authority, the Director of the Office of Federal Operations will 
send  a  notice  to  the  agency  requesting  information  on  compliance  with  the  variance 
provisions.   

Electronic submission of pilot authority  requests  must be  made using email  transmission of all 
documents  to  federalsectoreeo@eeoc.gov  or  through  the  Commission’s  electronic  document 
submission portal.

CHAPTER 2  
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PRE-COMPLAINT PROCESSING 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

A. 

Counseling Generally1

The  EEO  process  begins  when  a  person  who  believes  s/he  has  been  aggrieved 
meets  with  an  EEO  Counselor.2
    For  further  information  on  coverage  under  the 
statutes,  see 
Section  2.III.A.1  in  “Threshold  Issues”  of  the  Commission’s 
Compliance Manual.

In this Management Directive, the term 

“EEO  Counselor”  refers  to  any  agency  or  contracted  employee 
who,  serving  as  a  neutral,  provides  an  aggrieved  individual  with 
his/her rights and obligations under equal employment opportunity 
laws, gathers limited data and may attempt an informal resolution 
to 
where  ADR 
29 C.F.R.§ 1614. 

is  not  offered  or  accepted,  pursuant 

The  EEO  Counselor  provides  vital  information  regarding  the  EEO  process  and 
other  processes  that  may  be  available  to  the  aggrieved  individual,  gathers  basic 
information regarding the matter(s) from the aggrieved individual, and attempts to 
informally resolve the matter(s) if the matter does not go to the alternative dispute 
resolution program.  The EEO Counselor plays a vital role in ensuring prompt and 
efficient  processing  of  the  formal  complaint.    This  section  of  the  Management 
Directive  provides  Commission  guidance  and  procedures  that  EEO  Counselors 
should follow when presented with individual and class claims of discrimination.   

1 Please note: there is no pre-counseling phase of the 29 C.F.R. § 1614 process. 

2 The Commission consistently has held that a person may satisfy the criterion of EEO Counselor 
contact by initiating contact with any agency official logically connected with the EEO process, even if 
that official is not an EEO Counselor, and by exhibiting an intent to begin the EEO process.  See Hyman 
v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 0120100060 (May 26, 2011); Martell v. Dep’t. of Commerce, 
EEOC Appeal No. 0120110980 (Dec. 21, 2000); Lodge v. Social Security Administration, EEOC Appeal 
No. 0120110847 (May 12, 2011).

All time periods set out in this Management Directive are stated in calendar days 
unless otherwise indicated.  The first day counted is the day after the event from 
which  the  time  period  begins  to  run  and  the  last  day  of  the  period  shall  be 
included unless it falls on a Saturday or Sunday or federal holiday, in which case 
the period shall be extended to include the next business day.  All time periods are 
subject  to  waiver,  estoppel,  and  equitable  tolling.    See  the  Commission’s 
Compliance  Manual,  “Threshold  Issues”  915-003,  Section  2-IV  Timeliness  for 
further information. 

B. 

Full-Time EEO Counselors 

Agencies should use full-time EEO Counselors whenever possible.  If an agency 
must  rely  on  EEO  Counselors  for  whom  EEO  counseling  is  a  collateral-duty, 
agencies  should  consider  the  following  best  practices:    (1)  include  a  timeliness 
component  in  the  performance  plan  of  the  collateral-duty  EEO  Counselors;  (2) 
implement an agency policy to remove collateral duties from EEO Counselors for 
tardiness  or  inferior  work  product;  and  (3)  provide  incentives  for  good 
performance  by  using  on-the-spot  awards,  letters  to  supervisors,  and  awards 
presentations.3
    The  Commission  also  expects  agencies  to  use  the  step-by-step 
guide at Appendix B to develop or refine its own counseling procedures. 

C. 

EEO Counselor Training Requirements 

Continuing education and training for employees working in federal sector EEO 
is  vitally  important  to  promoting  the  goals  and  objectives  of  equal  employment 
opportunity.  This Chapter establishes mandatory training requirements for EEO 
Counselors.  See Section II below for mandatory training requirements. 

D. 

EEO Counseling and Investigations 

An  EEO  Counselor,  whether  agency  or  contracted,  may  not  serve  as  an 
investigator  in  a  dispute  in  which  s/he  provided  counseling  to  the  aggrieved 
person.    The  EEO  Counselor’s  role  is  to  provide  an  environment  for  open 
dialogue leading to an informal resolution prior to the filing of a complaint.  The 
role  is  compromised  if  the  EEO  Counselor  also  serves  as  an  investigator  of  the 
complaint,  as  the  role  of  the  investigator  is  that  of  a  neutral  fact  finder  who

Program: Efficiency” (2004).

EEO MD-110 

collects  and  discovers  factual  information  concerning  the  claim(s)  in  the 
complaint under investigation and prepares an investigative summary. 

The Commission also discourages  agencies from allowing an EEO Counselor to 
act  as  an  investigator  in  a  different  dispute.    Combining  the  roles  of  EEO 
Counselor  and  investigator  (even  with  regard  to  different  disputes)  can  create  a 
perception of bias and potentially confuse individuals with regard to the purpose 
of the counseling process.  Therefore, the Commission recommends against using 
EEO Counselors as investigators, except as a last resort.  

E. 

EEO Counseling and EEO ADR 

Both EEO alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and EEO counseling are essential 
to  the  prompt  resolution  of  claims  of  discrimination.    The  opportunity  for 
informal resolution is important.  EEO ADR is a term used to describe a variety of 
approaches to resolving conflict that differ from traditional adjudicatory methods 
or adversarial methods.  EEO ADR provides a means of improving the efficiency 
of the federal EEO complaint process by attempting early and informal resolution 
of EEO disputes without the filing of a complaint.  

When  an  aggrieved  person  seeks  pre-complaint  counseling,  the  EEO  Counselor 
must fully inform the individual of: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

how the agency EEO ADR program works; 

the  opportunity  to participate in the program  where the  agency  agrees to 
offer EEO ADR in a particular case; and  

the  right  to  file  a  formal  complaint  if  EEO  ADR  does  not  achieve  a 
resolution.   

See Chapter 3 of this Management Directive for more detailed EEO ADR information.   

II.  MANDATORY EEO COUNSELOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 

A.  Minimum Requirements 

To  ensure  quality  counseling  throughout  the  federal  sector,  the  Commission 
requires  that  new  EEO  Counselors,  including  contract  and  collateral-duty  EEO 
Counselors,  receive  a  minimum  of  thirty-two  (32)  hours  of  EEO  Counselor 

Management Directive 
2-3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

training prior to assuming counseling duties.  In addition to the training for new 
EEO  Counselors,  all  EEO  Counselors  are  required  to  receive  at  least  eight  (8) 
hours of continuing EEO Counselor training each fiscal year. 

The  Commission  has  developed  training  courses  to  satisfy  these  minimum 
requirements, and it offers them to agencies through the Commission’s Revolving 
Fund Program on a fee-for-service basis.4
  Agencies may also develop their own 
courses  to  satisfy  this  requirement  as  long  as  the  training  meets  the  minimum 
standards set forth by the Commission.  

B.  Minimum Standards for Thirty-Two-Hour Training Course 

New EEO Counselors must receive at a minimum, training in the following areas 
before an agency assigns them to provide EEO counseling to aggrieved persons: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

an  overview  of  the  entire  EEO  process  set  forth  under  29  C.F.R.  Part 
1614,  emphasizing  important  time  frames  in  the  EEO  process,  providing 
an  overview of counseling class complaints, and analyzing fragmentation 
issues  (see  Chapter  5,  Section  III  of  this  Management  Directive  for  a 
discussion of fragmentation); 

a  review  of  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  an  EEO  Counselor,  as 
described  in  this  Chapter  and  in  the  appendices  to  this  Management 
Directive; 

an overview of the statutes that the Commission enforces, including Title 
the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as  amended  (prohibiting 
VII  of 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin); 
the  Equal  Pay  Act  of  1963  (prohibiting  agencies  from  paying  different 
wages to men and women performing equal work in the same work place); 
the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  of  1967,  as  amended 
(prohibiting discrimination against persons age 40 or older); Sections 501 
and  505  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  as  amended  (prohibiting 
discrimination against people with disabilities); and Title II of the Genetic 
Information  Nondiscrimination  Act  of  2008  (prohibiting  discrimination 
based on genetic information);

identifying claims, writing reports, and attempting resolution; 

a review of other procedures available to aggrieved persons: the right to go 
directly  to  court  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  after 
notice  to  the  Commission;  mixed  case  processing  issues,  including  the 
right  of  election;  class  complaints  processing  issues;  and  the  negotiated 
grievance procedure, including the right of election;

C. 

Standards for Continuing Training Requirements 

Once  new  EEO  Counselors  complete  the  minimum  requirements,  they  must 
receive a minimum of eight hours of continuing EEO counseling training during 
every fiscal year thereafter.  The purpose of this continuing training requirement 
is to keep EEO Counselors informed of developments in EEO practice, law, and 
guidance, as well as to enhance and develop their counseling skills.  Accordingly, 
agencies  should  conduct  a  needs  assessment  to  determine  specific  areas  for 
training.  The Commission anticipates that this training will include segments on 
legal  and  policy  updates,  regulatory  and  statutory  changes,  counseling  skills 
development, and EEO ADR program updates. 

III.  THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN EEO COUNSELOR 

When  an  aggrieved  individual  seeks  EEO  counseling,  the  EEO  Counselor  begins  their 
role of educator and must ensure that the aggrieved individual understands his/her rights 
and responsibilities in the EEO process, including the option to participate in EEO ADR.  
The  EEO Counselor will also  perform  the roles  of  information  gatherer,  and  facilitator, 
and possibly translator,  messenger, and suggestion maker as set forth below.  The EEO 
Counselor  must  perform  several  tasks  in  all  cases,  regardless  of  whether  the  aggrieved 
individual ultimately participates in EEO ADR, including:

4. 

5. 

Advise  the  aggrieved  individual  about  the  EEO  complaint  process  under 
29 C.F.R. Part  1614.   The EEO  Counselor should explain  the reasonable 
accommodations  available  throughout  the  EEO  process.    The  EEO 
Counselor should explain the agency EEO ADR program, stating that the 
program  is  available  to  the  aggrieved  individual  or  advising  whether  the 
program  will  be  made  available.    The  EEO  Counselor  should  further 
explain  that  if  the  EEO  ADR  program  is  available,  the  aggrieved 
individual  will  have  to  decide  whether  to  seek  pre-complaint  resolution 
through the EEO ADR process or through the traditional EEO counseling 
process.    In  this regard,  the EEO Counselor  should  inform  the aggrieved 
individual about the differences between the two processes.  (Educator) 

Determine  the  claim(s)  and  basis(es)  raised  by  the  aggrieved  individual.  
(Information gatherer) 

Conduct  a  limited  inquiry  during  the  initial  interview  with  the  aggrieved 
individual  for  the  purpose  of  determining  jurisdictional  questions.    This 
includes  determining  whether  there  may  be  issues  relating  to  the 
timeliness  of  the  individual’s  EEO  Counselor  contact  and  obtaining 
information  relating  to  this  issue.    It  also  includes  obtaining  enough 
information  concerning  the  claim(s)  and  basis(es)  so  as  to  enable  the 
agency to properly identify the legal claim raised if the individual files a 
complaint at the conclusion of the EEO counseling process.  (Information 
gatherer ) 

Use  of  the  term  “initial  interview”  in  this  context  is  not  intended  to 
suggest  that  during  the  first  meeting  with  the  aggrieved  person  an  EEO 
Counselor must obtain all of the information s/he needs to determine the 
claim(s)  or  basis(es).    Nor  does  it  mean  that  if  the  aggrieved  individual 
decides to participate in EEO ADR, the EEO Counselor is prevented from 
contacting  them  to  obtain  such  additional  information  as  s/he  needs  for 
this specific purpose. 

Seek  a  resolution  of  the  dispute  at  the  lowest  possible  level,  unless  the 
agency offers EEO ADR and the aggrieved individual agrees to participate 
in  the  EEO  ADR  program.    If  the  dispute  is  resolved  in  counseling,  the 
EEO  Counselor  must  document  the  resolution.    (Facilitator,  translator, 
messenger, and suggestion maker) 

Advise  the  aggrieved  individual  of  his/her  right  to  file  a  formal 
discrimination  complaint  if  attempts  to  resolve  the  dispute  through  EEO 
counseling or EEO ADR are unsuccessful.  (Educator)

Advise the aggrieved person that their identity will not be revealed unless 
the  aggrieved  person  authorizes  them  to  reveal  it  or  they  file  a  formal 
complaint with the agency.  (Educator) 

The  Commission  has  developed  a  guide  for  EEO  counseling  that  agencies  may  use  in 
developing  or  refining  their  own  procedures.    (See  Appendix  B  of  this  Management 
Directive).   

IV. 

INITIAL INTERVIEW SESSION 

A. 

Provide Required Written Notice  

At the initial session or  as soon  as possible thereafter,  the  EEO Counselor must 
provide all aggrieved individuals written notice of their rights and responsibilities.  
29  C.F.R.  § 1614.105(b).    The  Commission  has set  forth  this  information  in  the 
“EEO Counselor Checklist,” in Appendix C of this Management Directive. 

B. 

Provide Information on Other Procedures as Required 

Depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, an aggrieved person may 
have  options  other  than  the  Part  1614  procedure  available  in  pursuit  of  a 
discrimination  claim.    The  individual,  in  some  cases,  may  have  to  elect  the 
process  s/he  wishes  to  pursue.    Election  options  apply  in  age  discrimination 
complaints, mixed case complaints, Equal Pay Act complaints, and claims where 
certain  negotiated  grievance  procedures  apply.    In  addition,  procedures  may  be 
available through the Office of Special Counsel.  As such, EEO Counselors must 
be  familiar  with  these  procedures  and  be  able  to  identify  such  cases  when  the 
aggrieved  person  first  seeks  counseling.    See  Appendices  D  and  E  of  this 
Management Directive.5

5 See Chapter 4, Section II, of this Management Directive, for additional guidance on the election 

process applicable to mixed case complaints.

C. 

Explain Statutes and Regulations 

EEO  Counselors  must  have  a  good  working  knowledge  of  the  complaint 
processing regulations in Part 1614 and a sufficient familiarity with federal anti-
discrimination  statutes,  regulations  and  Commission  guidance  that  will  enable 
them to identify bases and claims correctly.  These statutes are: 

1. 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended 

Title VII  prohibits discrimination based on  race,  color,  religion, sex, and 
national origin.  It also prohibits reprisal or retaliation for participating in 
the  discrimination  complaint  process  or  for  opposing  any  employment 
practice that the individual reasonably and in good faith believes violates 
Title VII. 

Title  VII’s  prohibition  against  sex  discrimination  includes  discrimination 
on the basis of pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender identity including 
transgender status.   

A claim of discrimination based on sexual orientation is inherently a claim 
of sex discrimination.  Baldwin v. Dep’t. of Transportation, EEOC Appeal 
No.  0120133080  (July  15,  2015).    A  claim  of  discrimination  based  on 
gender identity or transgender status is also a claim of sex discrimination.  
Macy  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120120821  (Apr.  20, 
2012).    EEO  Offices  should  therefore  process  such  complaints  under  29 
C.F.R.  Part  1614  as  claims  of  sex  discrimination,  unless  complainant 
specifically requests to use a different process.  For additional information, 
see Addressing Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in 
Federal Civilian Employment  

2. 

Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (ADEA) 

The ADEA prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age (40 
years or older).  It also prohibits retaliation against individuals exercising 
their rights under the statute.  Unlike Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, 
the  ADEA  allows  persons  claiming  age  discrimination  to  go  directly  to 
court,  after  giving  the  Commission  30  days’  notice  of  the  intent  to  file 
such  an  action,  without  utilizing  an  agency’s  administrative  complaint 
procedures.    If,  however,  an  individual  chooses  to  file  an  administrative 
complaint, s/he must exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to 
court. 
  As  with  Title  VII  complaints,  a  complainant  exhausts 
administrative  remedies  180  days  after  filing  a  formal  complaint,  if  the

agency has not taken a final action, or 180 days after filing an appeal with 
the Commission if the Commission has not issued a decision. 

3. 

Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 

The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of mental and 
physical  disabilities,  as  well  as  retaliation  for  exercising  rights  under  the 
Act.    The  Rehabilitation  Act  requires  that  agencies  make  reasonable 
accommodations  to  the  known  physical  or  mental  limitations  of  an 
applicant  or  qualified  employee  with  a  disability  unless  the  agency  can 
demonstrate that the accommodations would impose an undue hardship on 
the operation of its program.  (Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973  in  October  1992  to  provide  that  the  standards  used  to  determine 
whether  non-affirmative  action  employment  discrimination  has  occurred 
shall  be  the  standards  applied  under  Title  I  of  the  Americans  with 
Disabilities  Act.   See  § 503(b)  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  Amendments  of 
1992,  Pub.  L.  No.  102-569,  106  Stat  4344  (Oct.  29,  1992);  29  U.S.C. 
§ 791(g).)  (Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act again when it issued 
the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  Amendments  Act  of  2008.)    This 
statute  broadly  interprets  the  definition  of  disability  by  adding  “major 
bodily  functions”  as  a  major  life  activity  and  by  directing  that  the 
determination  of  whether  an  impairment  substantially  limits  a  major  life 
activity  should  be  determined  based  on  the  impairment’s  effect  in  its 
active state (for impairments that are episodic or in remission) and should 
be  determined  without  taking  into  account  the  ameliorative  effects  of 
mitigating measures, such as medication. 

4. 

Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) 

The  EPA  prohibits  sex-based  wage  discrimination.    It  prohibits  federal 
agencies from paying employees of one sex lower wages than those of the 
opposite sex for performing substantially equal work.  Substantially equal 
work  means  that  the  jobs  require  equal  skills,  effort,  and  responsibility, 
and  that  the  jobs  are  performed  under  similar  working  conditions.6
    The 
EPA also prohibits retaliation for exercising rights under the Act.   

5. 

Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 

6Sex-based  claims  of  wage  discrimination  may  also  be  raised  under  Title  VII;  individuals  so 
aggrieved  may  thus  claim  violations  of  both  statutes  simultaneously.    EPA  complaints  are  processed 
under  Part  1614.    In  the  alternative,  an  EPA  complainant  may  go  directly  to  a  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction on the EPA claim.

to 
Rights  Act  of  1964 
compensation  discrimination  under  Title  VII,  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment Act of 1967, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
may file a complaint within forty-five (45) days of any of the following:

When the individual’s compensation is affected by the application 
of a discriminatory compensation decision or other discriminatory 
practice, including each time the individual receives compensation 
that is based in whole or in part on such compensation decision or 
other practice. 

The Act also has a retroactive effective date of May 28, 2007, and applies 
to all claims of discriminatory compensation pending on or after that date. 

6. 

Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) 

GINA  prohibits  discrimination  by  federal  agencies  based  on  an 
individual’s genetic information, which includes the results of genetic tests 
to  determine  whether  the  individual  is  at  increased  risk  of  acquiring  a 
condition in the future, as well as an individual’s family medical history.  
Specifically,  the  law  prohibits  the  use  of  genetic  information  in  making 
employment  decisions, restricts  the acquisition of  genetic information by 
federal agencies, imposes strict confidentiality requirements, and prohibits 
retaliation  against  individuals  who  oppose  actions  made  unlawful  by 
GINA.    The  remedies  available  under  GINA  are  the  same  as  those

Commission Regulations, Guidelines, and Policy Directives 

The  Commission  has  issued  regulations  that  address  the  application  of 
federal nondiscrimination law to the federal government.  The regulations 
governing  the  processing  of  federal  sector  discrimination  complaints  are 
contained  in  Title  29  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (C.F.R.),  Part 
1614. 
  The  regulations  set  out  the  EEO  Counselor’s  obligations 
enumerated in Section II of this Chapter. 

Other  Commission  regulations  and  guidelines  address  the  substantive 
provisions of federal nondiscrimination law.  For example, 29 C.F.R. Part 
1630  sets  forth  Commission  regulations  applicable  to  the  Rehabilitation 
Act.    EEO  Counselors  should  be  familiar  with  Part  1630  in  order  to 
counsel individuals who present claims of disability discrimination.7
  The 
Commission  also  has  disseminated  enforcement  guidance  on  discrete 
Enforcement 
issues  and  areas  of  nondiscrimination  law,  such  as  “
Guidance:  Vicarious  Employer  Liability  for  Unlawful  Harassment  by 
Supervisors
,” issued June 18, 1999, and “Revised Enforcement Guidance 
on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans 
with  Disabilities  Act,”  issued  October  17,  2002.    These  documents  and 
other Enforcement Guidance are available on the Commission’s website at 
http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement_guidance.cfm 
the 
Enforcement Guidance and Related Documents section.  

in 

7  The  Commission  has  issued  guidelines  covering  all  of  the  substantive  bases  of  prohibited 
discrimination.    EEO  Counselors  should  be  familiar  with  29  C.F.R.  Part  1604  (Guidelines  on  Sex 
Discrimination)  and  Appendix  to  Part  1604  (Questions  and  Answers  on  the  Pregnancy  Discrimination 
Act);  Part  1605  (Guidelines  on  Religious  Discrimination);  Part  1606  (Guidelines  on  National  Origin 
Discrimination); Part 1620 (The Equal Pay Act); Part 1625 (the Age Discrimination in Employment Act); 
and Part 1635 (Guidelines on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act).

V. 

THE LIMITED INQUIRY 

Once  the  EEO  Counselor  has  determined  the  basis(es)  and  claim(s)  adhering  to  the 
guidance set forth below, s/he should conduct a limited inquiry.  Prior to any resolution 
attempts,  a  limited  inquiry  should  be  conducted  in  all  counseling.    The  purpose  of  the 
limited inquiry is to obtain information to determine jurisdictional questions if a formal 
complaint  is  filed  and  is  performed  regardless  of  whether  the  aggrieved  person 
subsequently chooses EEO ADR.  The limited inquiry also is used to obtain information 
for settlement purposes if the person chooses EEO counseling over EEO  ADR, or does 
not have the right to choose between EEO counseling and EEO ADR, for example where 
the  agency  has  specified  in  its  written  EEO  ADR  procedures  that  the  matter  is 
inappropriate for EEO ADR.  For further information, see Chapter 3 Section III.C of this 
Management Directive.  

While  the  scope  of  the  inquiry  will  vary  based  on  the  complexity  of  the  claims,  the 
inquiry  is  intended  to  be  limited  and  is  not  intended  to  substitute  for  the  in-depth  fact-
finding  required  in  the  investigative  stage  of  formal  complaint  process.    The  EEO 
Counselor  must  at  all  times  control  the  inquiry.    If  the  aggrieved  person  or  agency 
personnel raise objections to the scope or nature of the inquiry, the EEO Counselor shall 
seek  guidance  and  assistance  from  the  EEO  Director.    If  the  EEO  Counselor  has 
problems with the inquiry, s/he should immediately notify the EEO Director. 

Appendix B includes suggested methods for conducting the inquiry.  This guidance may 
be used to supplement established procedures. 

A. 

Determining the Claim(s) 

1. 

Fragmentation 

The  EEO  Counselor  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  complaint  process.    As 
discussed  in  more  detail  in  Chapter  5,  Section  III  of  this  Management 
Directive,  EEO  Counselors  must  assist  the  aggrieved  individual  in 
articulating  the  claim  so  as  to  avoid  fragmenting  the  claim.    EEO 
Counselors must review the materials set forth in Section III of Chapter 5 
and become familiar with the concept of fragmentation. 

2. 

Identifying the claim(s) 

At the initial interview, the EEO Counselor must determine what action(s) 
the  agency  has  taken  or  is  taking  that  causes  the  aggrieved  person  to 
believe  s/he  is  the  victim  of  discrimination.    Before  the  EEO  Counselor 
begins  the  inquiry,  s/he  must  be  certain  that  the  claim(s)  are  clearly 

Management Directive 
2-12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

defined and the aggrieved person agrees with how the agency defines the 
claim(s).    The  EEO  Counselor  must  also  determine,  based  on  his/her 
understanding  of  the  claims,  whether  special  procedures  apply.    For 
further  information  about  special  procedures,  see  Chapter  4  of  this 
Management Directive. 

If  a  claim  is  like  or  related  to  a  previously  filed  complaint,  then  the 
complaint should be amended to include that claim when the agency can 
complete  the  development  of  an  impartial  and  appropriate  factual  record 
within 360 days of when the original complaint was filed.  If the claim is 
not  like  or  related  to  a  previously  filed  complaint,  or  where  an  impartial 
and appropriate record cannot be developed within 360 days of when the 
original complaint was filed, the claim should be processed as a separate 
complaint.    Commission  regulations  require  agencies  to  consolidate 
complaints for processing unless it is impossible to do so.  See 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.606.    In  a  process  set  forth  in  Chapter  5,  Section  III.B  of  this 
Management Directive, a complainant shall be instructed to submit a letter 
to the agency’s EEO Director or designee, describing the new incident(s) 
and stating that s/he wishes to amend his/her complaint to include the new 
incident(s).    The  EEO  Director  or  designee  shall  review  the  request  and 
determine  the  correct  handling  of  the  amendment  in  an  expeditious 
manner. 

B. 

Determining the Basis(es)  

The  aggrieved  person  must  believe  s/he  has  been  discriminated  against  on  the 
basis  of  race,  color,  sex  (includes  pregnancy,  equal  pay,  gender  identity,  and 
sexual  orientation)  when  discrimination  based  on,  religion,  national  origin,  age 
(40  and  over),  disability,  genetic  information,  or  in  retaliation  for  having 
participated  in  activity  protected  by  the  various  civil  rights  statutes.    The  EEO 
Counselor should determine if the aggrieved person believes that his/her problem 
is the result of discrimination on one or more of the bases.   

C.  When the Basis(es) Is Not Covered by the EEO Laws 

If it is clear that the aggrieved person’s problem does not involve a basis(es) set 
forth  in  the  Commission’s  laws  and  regulations,  the  EEO  Counselor  should 
inform the aggrieved person and, if possible, provide him/her with the appropriate 
process for addressing the matter.  If the aggrieved person insists that s/he wants 
to  file  a  discrimination  complaint,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  conduct  a  final 
interview  and  issue  the  Notice  of  Right  to  File  a  Discrimination  Complaint.  

Management Directive 
2-13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

Under  no  circumstance  should  the  EEO  Counselor  attempt  to  dissuade  a  person 
from filing a complaint. 

VI.  RESOLUTION 

In almost all instances, informal resolution with an EEO Counselor, freely arrived at by 
all parties involved in the dispute, is the best outcome of a counseling action.  In seeking 
resolution, the EEO Counselor must listen to and understand the viewpoint of both parties 
so that s/he is able to assist the parties in achieving resolution.  The EEO Counselor’s role 
is to facilitate resolution, not develop, or advocate specific terms of an agreement.  The 
EEO Counselor must be careful not to inject his/her views on settlement negotiations.8

Appendix C includes suggested  methods for seeking resolution.   This  guidance may be 
used to supplement established agency procedures. 

A. 

Extension of Counseling for Resolution Efforts 

When  the  aggrieved  individual  and  an  EEO  Counselor  engage  in  resolution 
efforts, they may decide that they need additional time to reach an agreement.  If 
the aggrieved person consents, the EEO office may extend the counseling period 
an  additional  period  up  to  but  not  exceeding  60  days.    See  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105(e). 

B. 

Resolution of the Dispute 

If, during the course of the limited inquiry, the agency and the aggrieved person 
agree to an informal resolution of the dispute, the terms of the resolution must be 
reduced  to  writing,  clearly  identify  the  claims  resolved,  and  be  signed  by  both 
parties9
  to  help  ensure  they  have  the  same  understanding  of  the  terms  of  the 
resolution.    See  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.603.    The  Commission  recommends  that  the 
EEO Counselor, with the knowledge and guidance of the EEO Director, set forth 
the terms as agreed to by the parties (agency and the aggrieved individual) of the 
informal  resolution  in  a  settlement  transmitted  to  the  parties.    The  letter  should 

8 As noted in Appendix C, at point “B,” the EEO Counselor acts as a neutral and not as an advocate 
for  the  aggrieved  person  or  the  agency.    When  the  aggrieved  person  seeks  advice  from  the  EEO 
Counselor, the Counselor should remind him/her of the right to representation.  

9 Please note that in the federal EEO process, the parties are the complainant and the agency.  See 
Bates  v.  Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  851  F.2d  1366,  1368  (11th  Cir.  1988).    The  supervisor/manager 
who has been accused of discrimination is not a party to the EEO complaint, although he may be subject 
to other legal liability.  Id.

EEO MD-110 

state clearly the terms of the informal resolution and should notify the aggrieved 
person of the procedures available under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.504, in the event that 
the  agency  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  resolution.    Other  laws  may 
provide  requirements  in  settlement  agreements,  as  for  example,  the  Older 
Worker’s  Benefit  Protection  Act  of  1990.    Appendix  F  in  this  Management 
Directive is a recommended format for the resolution settlement.   

The  EEO  Counselor  shall  transmit  a  signed  and  dated  copy  of  the  settlement  to 
the EEO Director.  The EEO Director shall retain the copy for four years or until 
s/he is certain that, the agreement has been fully implemented. 

C. 

Failure to Resolve the Dispute 

The aggrieved person may not be satisfied with the agency’s proposed resolution 
of  the  dispute,  or  the  agency  officials  may  not  agree  to  the  aggrieved  person’s 
suggestions.  If informal resolution is not possible, the EEO Counselor must hold 
a final interview with the aggrieved person and issue the Notice of Right to File a 
Discrimination Complaint.  No further counseling should occur. 

VII.  THE EEO ADR PROGRAM 

A. 

The Choice of EEO Counseling or EEO ADR 

At  the  initial  counseling  session  the  EEO  Counselor  will  inquire  whether  the 
aggrieved is interested in trying to resolve the  matter through the  agency’s EEO 
ADR program.  If the aggrieved is interested, then within a reasonable time, the 
agency must decide whether to offer EEO ADR to the aggrieved person.  When 
the agency offers EEO ADR in accordance with its EEO ADR policy/procedures, 
and the aggrieved agrees to participate, then the agency must provide an official 
with  settlement  authority  for  the  EEO  ADR  process.    See  Chapter  3  of  this 
Management Directive for more information about the EEO ADR process.  If the 
agency offers  EEO ADR, then  the aggrieved  person must be given a reasonable 
time to choose whether to pursue counseling or participate in EEO ADR.  If the 
aggrieved person chooses to participate in EEO ADR, counseling activities must 
end.  The EEO Counselor should resume the EEO process as specified in Section 
VII.B of this Chapter.   

To participate in EEO ADR, the aggrieved person must sign the agency’s Election 
Form,  Agreement  to  Mediate,  or  other  similar  form.    The  EEO  Counselor’s 
Report should include the signed form.

B. 

Role of the EEO Counselor during EEO ADR Process 

When  an  aggrieved  person  chooses  to  participate  in  the  EEO  ADR  process,  the 
EEO Counselor cannot attempt to resolve the matter.  Once the aggrieved person 
selects  EEO  ADR,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  complete  the  intake  functions  of 
counseling  (that  is,  obtaining  the  information  needed  to  determine  the  basis(es), 
claim(s),  timeliness,  and  desired  redress)  and  refer  the  dispute  for  EEO  ADR 
processing.  Once those tasks are completed, the EEO Counselor should have no 
further  involvement  in  resolving  the  matter  until  s/he  learns  the  outcome  of  the 
EEO  ADR  process.    The  role  of  the  EEO  Counselor  will  vary  depending  on 
whether the parties successfully resolve the dispute during EEO ADR. 

1. 

Successful EEO ADR Outcome 

The EEO Counselor shall advise the aggrieved person that if the dispute is 
resolved during the  EEO ADR process, the  terms of  the agreement must 
be in writing, clearly identify the claims resolved, and be signed by both 
parties.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.603. 

2. 

Unsuccessful EEO ADR/Aggrieved Withdraws from ADR 

The  EEO  Counselor  shall  advise  the  aggrieved  person  that  if  EEO  ADR 
does not resolve the dispute, or if the matter is not resolved within ninety 
(90) days from the initial contact with the EEO Counselor, the aggrieved 
person will receive a final interview and Notice of Right to File a Formal 
Complaint explaining how to file a formal complaint. 

In addition, the EEO Counselor must prepare the EEO Counselor’s Report 
and  conduct  the  final  interview.    The  report  should  state  whether  the 
parties  attempted  EEO  ADR,  but  cannot  reveal  any  other  information 
about the EEO ADR attempt.   

C. 

Completing the EEO ADR Process 

If  the  agency  offers  EEO  ADR  in  a  particular  case  and  the  aggrieved  person 
agrees  to  participate,  the  pre-complaint  processing  period  shall  be  up  to  ninety 
(90) days.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(f).  Should the parties successfully resolve 
the  dispute  during  the  EEO  ADR  process,  they  must  sign  a  written  settlement 
agreement.    See  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.603.    In  addition,  the  EEO  ADR  program 
should  notify  the  EEO  Counselor  of  the  settlement,  and  provide  a  copy  of  the 
document.

August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

If  the  dispute  is  not  resolved  within  the  90-day  period,  the  EEO  ADR  program 
will  notify  the  EEO  Counselor,  who  will  issue  the  Notice  of  Right  to  File  a 
Discrimination  Complaint,  required  by  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.105(d),  as  soon  as 
possible,  but  not  later  than  the  90th  day  after  the  individual  initiates  the  EEO 
process or contacts the EEO office.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(f). 

VIII.  FINAL INTERVIEW 

During the final interview with the aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor should discuss 
what occurred during the EEO counseling process in terms of attempts at resolution.  The 
EEO  Counselor  should  provide  the  aggrieved  with  information  to  move  the  matter 
forward  and  answer  any  questions  the  aggrieved  may  have.    The  EEO  Counselor  must 
not  indicate  whether  s/he  believes  the  discrimination  complaint  has  merit.    Since  EEO 
counseling  inquiries  are  conducted  informally  and  do  not  involve  sworn  testimony  or 
extensive documentation,  the EEO Counselor (1)  cannot  make  findings  on  the claim of 
discrimination,  and  (2)  should  not  imply  to  the  aggrieved  person  that  his/her 
interpretation of the claims of the case constitutes an official finding of the agency on the 
claim  of  discrimination.    See  Appendix  G  for  a  sample  Notice  of  Right  to  File  a 
Discrimination Complaint. 

In  addition,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  provide  the  aggrieved  person  with  the  following 
information: 

A. 

Right to Pursue the Claim through the Formal Process 

If the dispute has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the aggrieved person, the 
EEO Counselor must tell the aggrieved person that s/he has the right to pursue the 
claim further through the formal complaint procedure.  It is the aggrieved person, 
and not the EEO Counselor, who must decide whether to file a formal complaint 
of discrimination. 

B. 

Requirements of the Formal Complaint 

The EEO Counselor must inform the aggrieved person that the complaint:  

1. 

2. 

Must be in writing; 

Must be specific with regard to the claim(s) that the aggrieved person 
raised in EEO counseling and that the person wishes to pursue;

EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

3. 

4. 

Must be signed by the complainant or complainant’s attorney; and  

Must  be  filed  within  fifteen  (15)  calendar  days  from  the  date  s/he 
receives the Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint.  Written 
complaints  filed  by  facsimile,  electronic  communication,  hand  delivery 
during business hours, U.S. mail (confirmation services recommended), or 
other third-party commercial carrier must meet the regulatory time frames.  
The  date  of  the  postmark,  facsimile,  electronic  communication,  hand 
delivery, delivery to a third-party commercial carrier or in person filing at 
the  agency’s  EEO  office  is  considered  the  date  filed  and  must  be  within 
the requisite 15 days. 

C. 

Time Frames to Complete the Final Interview  

The  EEO  Counselor  must  conduct  the  final  interview  and  issue  the  Notice  of 
Right to File a Discrimination Complaint within 30 days of the date the aggrieved 
person  brought  the  dispute  to  the  EEO  Counselor’s  attention.    If,  however,  the 
aggrieved  person  consented  to  a  written  extension  of  time,  the  extension  cannot 
exceed  60  days  for  counseling.    If  the  aggrieved  agreed  to  participate  in  EEO 
ADR,  the  counseling  period  may  not  exceed  90  days.    If  the  dispute  is  not 
resolved at the end of the extended time period, the EEO Counselor must advise 
the aggrieved party in writing of his/her right to file a complaint. 

The 30-day EEO counseling period (or as extended by agreement of the aggrieved 
party) commences  when the aggrieved  person (1) first initiates contact with any 
agency  official  logically  connected  with  the  EEO  process  and  (2)  exhibits  an 
intent to begin the EEO process.  The unavailability of an EEO Counselor to meet 
with the aggrieved person for a period of time after such initial contact does not 
toll the 30-day counseling period.  Absent agreement from the aggrieved person 
to  extend  the  time  period,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  conduct  the  final  interview 
and issue the Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint at the end of the 
30-day period. 

D. 

Name(s) of Person(s) Authorized to Receive Complaints 

The EEO Counselor shall provide the aggrieved person with the names of persons 
authorized  to  receive  complaints  of  discrimination.    The  EEO  Counselor  shall 
inform the aggrieved person (or his/her representative) that the complaint must be 
delivered to one of the authorized persons.

E. 

Loss of Confidentiality during Formal Process  

In  accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.105(b)(2)(g),  the  EEO  Counselor  should 
explain that unless the aggrieved authorizes or files a formal EEO complaint, the 
EEO  Counselor  will  not  reveal  their  identity.    Once  the  complaint  is  filed,  the 
complaint file, or part of it, may be shared only with those who are involved and 
need  access  to  it.    This  includes  the  EEO  Director,  agency  EEO  officials,  and 
possibly persons whom the  aggrieved person  has  identified as being  responsible 
for the actions that gave rise to the complaint.  The complaint file is not a public 
document to be released outside the EEO complaint process.  The identity of the 
aggrieved person does not remain confidential in the formal complaint process.   

F.  Written Notice of Right to File a Discrimination Complaint 

After the final interview and not more than 30 days after the aggrieved contacted 
the  EEO  office,  the  written  Notice  of  Right  to  File  a  Discrimination  Complaint 
must  be  issued.    The  Notice  must  specify  that  an  aggrieved  person  has  15 
calendar  days  after  receipt  of  the  notice  of  Right  to  File  a  Discrimination 
Complaint to file a formal complaint (including a class complaint).   

The notice must also advise the aggrieved person of the appropriate official with 
whom  to  file  a  complaint  and  of  complainant’s  duty  to  inform  the  agency 
immediately when the complainant retains counsel or a representative. 

The  EEO  Counselor  must  advise  the  aggrieved  individual  of  his/her  duty  to 
inform the agency of a change of address if s/he should move during the pendency 
of the EEO process and the possible consequences for not doing so. 

IX.  THE EEO COUNSELOR’S REPORT  

When advised that an aggrieved person has filed a formal complaint, the EEO Counselor 
will submit a written report pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(c).  The report will contain 
relevant  information  about  the  aggrieved  person,  jurisdiction,  claims,  bases,  requested 
remedy, and the EEO Counselor’s checklist, as specified in the sample EEO Counselor’s 
Report.    See  Appendix  H  of  this  Management  Directive.    If  the  aggrieved  person 
attempted to resolve the dispute via counseling or EEO ADR, the report should state that 
the aggrieved person chose either traditional EEO counseling or the EEO ADR program 
and  that  the  dispute  was  not  resolved  through  either  procedure.    However,  the  report 
should not provide a summary of the resolution attempts, nor any opinion as to whether 
discrimination occurred.

The  EEO  Counselor  must  submit  to  the  office  designated  to  accept  formal 
complaints  and  to  the  aggrieved  individual  a  copy  of  the  EEO  Counselor’s 
Report.  This must be done within fifteen (15) days after notification by the EEO 
Director or other appropriate official that a formal complaint has been filed.  It is 
essential that the EEO Counselor maintain his/her record of counseling so that this 
regulatory time limit is met.

An  explanation  for  why  the  counseling  process  was    untimely,  if 
applicable; and 

5. 

An indication as to whether an attempt was made to resolve the complaint. 

The EEO Counselor should also retain a copy of the EEO Counselor’s Report for 
availability  in  the  event  that  the  original  EEO  Counselor’s  Report,  submitted  to 
the office designated to accept formal complaints, is lost or misplaced.  All notes, 
drafts  and  other  records  of  counseling  efforts  will  be  maintained  by  the  agency 
after counseling is completed for a period up to four years after resolution of the 
case. 

Appendix H is a recommended format for an EEO Counselor's report. 

C. 

Confidentiality of Negotiations for Resolution 

In order to facilitate resolution attempts, all parties involved in resolution must be 
free  to  explore  all  avenues  of  relief.    Offers  and  statements  by  parties  made  in 
response  to  resolution  attempts  by  the  EEO  Counselor  cannot  be  used  against 
either party during the administrative EEO process if resolution attempts fail.  The 
EEO Counselor will not report any discussions that occur during negotiations for 
resolution.    For  confidentiality  of  EEO  ADR  activities  see  Chapter  3,  Section 
II.a.3 of this Management Directive.

Occasionally, an EEO Counselor may need to  provide  EEO  counseling  to  an aggrieved 
person  or  group  of  individuals  who  seek  to  represent  a  class  of  persons.10
    A  class  is 
defined as  a  group of  employees,  former employees, or  applicants  who  allege  that they 
have been or are being adversely affected by an agency personnel policy or practice that 
discriminates  against  the  group  on  the  basis  of  their  common  race,  color,  religion,  sex, 
national  origin,  age,  genetic  information,  disability,  or  retaliation.    See  29  C.F.R. 
§§ 1614.103(a)  and  1614.204;  see  also  Chapter  8  of  this  Management  Directive  for 
further guidance for class actions. 

The  aggrieved  person(s)  comes  to  the  EEO Counselor  as  a  class  agent  representing  the 
group.  A class inquiry must be brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor by a class 
agent  within  forty-five  (45)  calendar  days  of  the  date  when  the  specific  policy  or 
practice adversely affected the class agent or, if a personnel action, within 45 days of the 
effective date of that action. 

The  EEO  counseling  requirements for  class  claims are the same as those for individual 
claims  of  discrimination,  but  the  facts  must  be  framed  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.204. 

It  is  strongly  recommended  that,  if  class  allegations  are  raised  or  an  individual 
approaches  an  EEO  Counselor  as  a  class  agent  for  counseling,  the  EEO  Counselor 
immediately contact the EEO Director, or designated person, for advice and guidance. 

10  This  need  may  arise  in  the  course  of  counseling  an  individual  where  the  EEO  Counselor 

identifies allegations of class discrimination.

CHAPTER 3  
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR EEO MATTERS 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Statutes enforced by the Commission, regulations, and executive orders encourage, with 
very  narrow,  mission  specific,  exceptions,  the  use  of  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution 
(ADR) in resolving employment EEO disputes.1
  EEO ADR is a term used to describe a 
variety  of  approaches  to  resolving  EEO  disputes  rather  than  traditional  adjudicatory 
methods or adversarial  methods.   Examples of traditional adjudicatory  methods  include 
litigation, hearings, and agency administrative processing and appeals. 

The  Commission’s  regulations  at  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.102  (b)(2)  require  agencies  to 
establish  or  make  available  an  EEO  ADR  program.    The  EEO  ADR  program  must  be 
available  during  the  pre-complaint  process  and  the  formal  complaint  process.    The 
Commission  regulations  extend  the  counseling  period  when  EEO  ADR  is  used.    See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(f).  In the federal EEO process, the  

“parties”  are  the  agency  and  the  aggrieved/complainant.    See  Bates  v. 
Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  851  F.2d  1366,  1368  (11th  Cir.  1988).    As 
such, the manager who was accused of discrimination does not qualify as 
a  party  because  that  person  is  not  a  statutorily  proper  defendant  in  the 
federal EEO process. 

Accordingly,  once  the  agency  decides  to  offer  EEO  ADR,  the  accused  manager  has  a 
duty to cooperate, like any witness, in the EEO ADR process, but may not be the agency 
official that has settlement authority. 

Agencies  and  aggrieved  individuals/complainants  have  realized  many  advantages  from 
utilizing EEO ADR.  EEO ADR offers the parties the opportunity for an early, informal 
resolution  of  disputes  in  a  mutually  satisfactory  fashion.    EEO  ADR  usually  costs  less 
and  uses  fewer  resources  than  traditional  administrative  or  adjudicative  processes, 
particularly  processes  that  include  a  hearing  or  litigation.    Early  resolution  of  disputes 
through  EEO  ADR  can  make  agency  resources  available  for  mission-related  programs 
and activities.  The agency can avoid costs such as court reporters and expert witnesses.  
In  addition,  employee  morale  can  be  enhanced  when  agency  management  is  viewed  as 
open-minded and cooperative in seeking to resolve disputes through EEO ADR. 

1 Agencies may have additional responsibilities under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 5 U.S.C. 
§ 574.  The EEOC does not have jurisdiction to enforce the ADRA on federal agencies.

The  Commission  will  review  an  agency’s  program  and  its  EEO  ADR  policies,  upon 
request, for consistency with 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  For more information, please contact 
the Office of Federal Operations at (202) 663-4599 or OFO.EEOC@EEOC.GOV. 

II. 

CORE PRINCIPLES OF EEO ADR 

Agencies may be flexible in designing their EEO ADR programs to fit their environment 
and  workforce,  provided  the  programs  conform  to  the  core  principles  set  forth  below.  
However, the Commission believes that there are certain requirements that are absolutely 
necessary for the successful development of any EEO ADR program.  The core principles 
include the concepts of fairness, flexibility, training, and evaluation.  Discussed below are 
these concepts. 

A. 

Fairness 

Any  program  developed  and  implemented  by  an  agency  must  be  fair  to  the 
participants,  both  in  perception  and  reality.    Fairness  should  be  manifested 
throughout  the  EEO  ADR  proceeding  by  providing,  at  a  minimum:    as  much 
information about the EEO ADR proceeding to the parties as soon as possible; the 
right to be represented throughout the EEO ADR proceeding; and an opportunity 
to obtain legal or technical assistance during the proceeding to any party who is 
not represented.  Fairness also requires the following elements: 

1. 

Voluntariness 

Parties  must  knowingly  and  voluntarily  enter  into  an  EEO  ADR 
proceeding.  An EEO ADR resolution can never be viewed as fair if it is 
involuntary.  Nor can a dispute be actually and permanently resolved if the 
resolution  is  involuntary.    Unless  the  parties  have  reached  a  resolution 
willingly  and  voluntarily,  the  dissatisfaction  of  one  party  could  lead  to 
conflicts within the  workplace or even to charges that the resolution was 
coerced or reached under duress.   

In  addition, aggrieved parties should be assured  that they  are  free  to end 
the EEO ADR process at any time, and that they retain the right to proceed 
with  the  administrative  EEO  process  if  they  prefer  that  process  to  EEO 
ADR  and  resolution  has  not  been  reached.    Both  parties  should  be 
reassured  that  no  one  can  force  a  resolution  on  them,  not  agency 
management, EEO officials, or the third-party neutral.  Finally, parties are 
more likely to approach a resolution voluntarily when they know of their 
right to representation at any time.   

Management Directive 
3-2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

Note:  When the agency determines it to be appropriate to offer EEO ADR 
to  an  individual,  there  is  no  conflict  with  voluntariness  when  the  agency 
requires  the  responsible  management  official  to  participate  since  s/he  is 
not a party and is not the agency official with settlement authority.  When 
the  agency  offers  the  individual  EEO  ADR  and  the  individual  agrees  to 
participate,  the  parties  have  voluntarily  entered  into  the  EEO  ADR 
process. 

2. 

Neutrality 

To  be  effective,  an  EEO  ADR  proceeding  must  be  impartial  and 
independent of any control by either party, in both perception and reality.  
Using  a  neutral  third  party  as  a  facilitator  or  mediator  ensures  this 
impartiality.  In this Management Directive a 

“neutral” refers to a third party who has no stake in the outcome 
of  the  proceeding  whose  function  is  to  assist  the  parties  in 
resolving the matters at hand.   

A neutral shall have no  official, financial, or personal conflict of interest 
with  respect  to  the  issues  in  controversy,  unless  such  interest  is  fully 
disclosed in writing to all parties and all parties agree that the neutral may 
serve.  For example, s/he might be an employee of another federal agency 
who knows none of the parties and whose type of work differs from that of 
the parties.  Or s/he may be an employee within the same agency as long 
as s/he can remain neutral regarding the outcome of the proceeding.  The 
agency must ensure the independence and objectivity of the neutral at all 
times. 

3. 

Confidentiality 

Confidentiality  is  essential  to  the  success  of  all  EEO  ADR  proceedings.  
Congress recognized this fact by enhancing the confidentiality provisions 
contained in the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA), 
specifically exempting qualifying dispute resolution communications from 
disclosure  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act.    See  5  U.S.C.  §  574.  
Parties  who  know  that  their  EEO  ADR  statements  and  information  are 
kept  confidential  will  feel  free  to  be  frank  and  forthcoming  during  the 
proceeding, without fear that such  information  may  later be  used  against 
them.    To  maintain  that  degree  of  confidentiality,  there  must  be  explicit 
limits  placed  on  the  dissemination  of  EEO  ADR  information.    For 
implementation and reporting purposes, the details of a resolution can be 

Management Directive 
3-3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disseminated to specific offices only with a need to have that information.  
Neither  the  ADRA  nor  the  Commission’s  core  principles  require  the 
parties to agree that a settlement must be confidential.   

in

Confidentiality  must  be  maintained  by  the  parties,  by  any  agency 
employees 
the 
implementation of an EEO ADR resolution, and by any neutral third party 
involved  in  the  proceeding.    The  Commission  encourages  agencies  to 
issue  clear,  written  policies  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  what  is  said 
and  done  during  an  EEO  ADR  proceeding  in  accordance  with  5 U.S.C. 
§ 574.  

in 

4. 

Enforceability 

Enforceability  is  a  key  principle  upon  which  a  successful  EEO  ADR 
program  depends.    Section  1614.504  of  29  C.F.R.  provides  that:  “Any 
settlement agreement knowingly and voluntarily agreed to by the parties, 
reached  at  any  stage  of  the  complaint  process,  shall  be  binding  on  both 
parties.”  The regulation sets forth specific procedures for enforcing such a 
settlement  agreement.    Agreements  resolving  claims  of  employment 
discrimination  reached  through  EEO  ADR  are  enforceable  through  this 
procedure. 

B. 

Flexibility 

The  EEO  ADR  program  must  be  flexible  enough  to  respond  to  the  variety  of 
situations individual agencies face.  There is not necessarily one EEO ADR model 
which will work for  all  of an agency’s programs, or  all of its offices within the 
same program.  Because agencies have different missions and cultures, they have 
flexibility  in  designing  their  EEO  ADR  programs.    Agencies  must  also  exercise 
flexibility  in  implementing  the  EEO  ADR  program.    This  flexibility  will  allow 
agencies to adapt to changing circumstances that could not have been anticipated 
or predicted at the time the program was initially implemented. 

C. 

Training 

An  EEO ADR program,  to be successful,  will require that the agency  at regular 
intervals  provide  appropriate  training  and  education  on  EEO  ADR  to  its 
employees, managers and supervisors, neutrals, and other persons protected under 
the applicable laws.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(b)(3).

August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

In  order  to  encourage  the  successful  operation  of  EEO  ADR  throughout  the 
agency,  all  managers  and  supervisors  must  receive  EEO  ADR  training,  either 
through  an  agency-conducted  program  or  through  an  external  source  such  as 
another  federal  agency  or  a  private  contractor.    The  EEO  ADR  training  must 
include the following, at a minimum:  

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

The  ADRA  and 
the  federal 
government’s interest in encouraging mutual resolution of disputes and the 
benefits associated with utilizing ADR; 

its  amendments,  with  emphasis  on 

The Commission’s regulations and Policy Guidance with respect to EEO 
ADR:  29 C.F.R.  §§  1614.102(b)(2),  1614.105(f),  1614.108(b),  and 
1614.603 (voluntary settlement attempts); 

The  operation  of  the  EEO  ADR  method  or  methods  that  the  agency 
employs; 

Exposure to other EEO ADR methods, including interest-based mediation, 
if this method is not already in use by the agency; and 

Drafting the settlement agreement, including the notice provision pursuant 
to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.504,  where  the  aggrieved  party  believes  the  agency 
failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement and any other 
legally required notices. 

D. 

Evaluation 

An evaluation component is essential to developing and maintaining an effective 
EEO  ADR  program,  and  should  be  in  place  before  an  EEO  ADR  program  is 
implemented.    The  evaluation  will  assist  in  determining  whether  the  EEO  ADR 
program  has  achieved  its  goals  and  will  provide  feedback  on  how  the  program 
might  be made more efficient and  achieve better results.   Evaluations can  range 
from  analyzing  the  EEO  ADR  data  on  an  annual  basis  to  interviewing  the  EEO 
ADR participants about their experience in the process.

III.  DEVELOPING AN EEO ADR PROGRAM 

A.  Written Procedures 

The agency must establish written procedures detailing the operation of its EEO 
ADR  program.    The  written  procedures  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  the 
following information: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

The type or types of EEO ADR resources and techniques that the agency 
offers; 

The stages of the EEO process at which EEO ADR will be offered and the 
appropriate agency official(s) who makes the determination to offer EEO 
ADR  on  behalf  of  the  agency  (note  the  responsible  management  official 
for  the  alleged  discrimination  is  not  the  proper  agency  official  for  this 
decision); 

The time frames involved in the administrative process and the EEO ADR 
process; 

The source or sources of neutrals; 

Those matters where EEO ADR is not available and the criteria the agency 
uses to determine when an issue is appropriate for ADR; 

Assurance to the aggrieved party that EEO ADR is voluntary and that s/he 
may  terminate  the  EEO  ADR  procedure  at  any  time  and  return  to  the 
informal EEO process where they will be issued a Notice of Right to File a 
Formal  Complaint  or  in  the  formal  EEO  process  to  the  place  where 
processing had ceased; 

Assurance  to  the  aggrieved  party  that  its  EEO  ADR  program  is  fair  and 
that s/he has the right to representation; 

An  explanation  to  the  aggrieved  party  with  respect  to  confidentiality, 
neutrality, and enforceability; and 

An  assurance  that  the  agency  will  make  accessible  an  individual  with 
settlement  authority,  and  that  no  responsible  management  official  or 
agency official directly involved in the case will serve as the person with 
settlement authority.

B. 

EEO ADR throughout the EEO Process 

If  a case  is  appropriate,  agencies may offer  EEO  ADR at any stage of the EEO 
process.    With  that  said,  the  Commission  encourages  agencies  to  resolve 
complaints of employment discrimination as early in the process as possible.  See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.603. 

1.  

EEO ADR during the Counseling Stage 

Under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.102(b)(2),  agencies  must  establish  or  make 
available  an  EEO  ADR  program  during  the  pre-complaint  process.  
Chapter  2  of  this  Management  Directive  provides  additional  guidance 
concerning the process of offering EEO ADR during counseling.   

2. 

EEO ADR after the Complaint Is Filed 

Under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.102(b)(2),  agencies  must  establish  or  make 
available  an  EEO  ADR  program  during  the  formal  complaint  process.   
The  regulations  also  state:    “Agencies  are  encouraged  to  incorporate 
alternative dispute resolution techniques into their investigative efforts in 
order  to  promote  early  resolution  of  complaints.”    See  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(b).  As such, agencies must design their EEO ADR program to 
allow  the  parties  to  pursue  EEO  ADR  techniques  after  various  stages  of 
the formal complaint processing period.   

3.  

EEO ADR at the Hearing and Appellate Stages 

The  Commission  encourages  EEO  ADR  attempts  by  the  Commission’s 
Administrative Judges prior to arranging a hearing.  See Chapter 7 in this 
Management Directive.  However, the parties may also pursue EEO ADR 
through  the  agency’s  EEO  ADR  program.    To  do  so,  the  parties  must 
notify  the  hearing  office  prior  to  utilizing  the  agency’s  EEO  ADR 
program.   

Similarly,  EEO  ADR  may  be  beneficial  at  the  appellate  stage  of  the 
administrative process.  At this stage, the parties should notify the Office 
of  Federal  Operations  (OFO)  of  their  interest  in  EEO  ADR.    They  may 
utilize the agency’s EEO ADR program, or request a neutral from OFO. 

Management Directive 
3-7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Matters Inappropriate for EEO ADR 

While the Commission contemplates that the majority of matters are appropriate 
for EEO ADR, the Commission recognizes that there are instances in which EEO 
ADR may not be appropriate or feasible.  See 5 U.S.C. § 572(b).  Agencies may 
decline  to  offer  EEO  ADR  for  particular  issues  related  to  the  agency’s  mission, 
such  as  security  clearances,  but  not  for  broad  issues  such  as  promotions  or 
performance evaluations.  Agencies have discretion to determine whether a given 
dispute is appropriate for EEO ADR.  However, agencies may not decline to offer 
EEO ADR to particular cases because of the bases involved (that is, race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or retaliation). 

D. 

Dealing with Non-EEO Issues 

Although  the  purpose  of  the  EEO  ADR  program  is  to  address  disputes  arising 
under statutes enforced by the Commission, the Commission has found that many 
workplace  disputes  brought  to  the  process  often  include  non-EEO  issues.    In 
designing their EEO ADR programs, agencies may provide sufficient latitude for 
the parties to raise and address both EEO and non-EEO issues (that is, issues that 
do  not  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  EEO  laws,  statutes  and  regulations)  in  the 
resolution of their disputes.  However, agencies are still responsible for any other 
statutory obligations they may have. 

E. 

Choosing among EEO ADR Techniques 

Agencies  should  carefully  consider  the  needs  of  their  workforce  when  selecting 
techniques and choose the technique or techniques that are most likely to result in 
the earliest successful resolution of workplace disputes. 

The Commission does not mandate the use of a particular EEO ADR technique in 
an agency’s EEO ADR program; however, the selected technique(s) must be used 
in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  core  principles.    Additionally,  each 
agency’s  EEO  ADR  program  shall  make  available  to  parties  at  a  minimum  one 
ADR  technique  which  allows  for  the  meaningful  participation  of  all  involved 
parties  (such  as  mediation,  facilitation,  or  settlement  conferences).    The  EEO 
ADR  program  must  not  diminish  an  individual’s  right  to  pursue  his/her  claim 
under the 1614 process should EEO ADR not resolve the dispute.  For example, 
an EEO ADR program may not require an individual to waive, as a prerequisite to 
participation, his/her right to an investigation, to a hearing, or to appeal the final 
decision to the Commission.

F.  

Time Frames of the EEO ADR Process 

An  EEO  ADR  program  must  be  designed  around  the  time  frames  of  the  EEO 
regulations.    For  example,  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.105(f)  provides  that  if  the  parties 
agree to participate in the EEO ADR process, the pre-complaint processing period 
may be extended not to exceed  ninety (90) days.  This time frame must be met to 
be consistent with the regulation.  If the dispute is not resolved in this time frame, 
the agency must advise the aggrieved person not later than the 90th day after the 
EEO  Counselor  contact  of  their  right  to  file  a  formal  complaint.    However, 
resolution efforts may continue so long as the parties and the neutral agree. 

Similarly,  if  an  individual  enters  into  an  EEO  ADR  procedure  after  a  formal 
complaint is filed, the time period for processing the complaint may be extended 
by  agreement  for  not  more  than  90  days.    If  the  dispute  is  not  resolved,  the 
complaint must be processed within the extended time period.  

G. 

Representation of the Parties 

Aggrieved  persons  have  the  right  to  representation  throughout  the  complaint 
process,  including  during  any  EEO  ADR  process.    While  the  purpose  of  EEO 
ADR  is  to  allow  the  parties  to  fashion  their  own  resolution  to  a  dispute,  it  is 
important  that  any  agency  ‘dispute  resolution  procedure’  provide  all  parties  the 
opportunity to bring a representative to the EEO ADR forum if they desire to do 
represent  aggrieved 
so. 
individuals/complainants in the EEO ADR process.  See Chapter 1 Section VI of 
this Management Directive for more information. 

  Note,  EEO  Officials  are  not  eligible 

to 

H. 

Spin-Off Complaints 

Nothing said or done during attempts to resolve the complaint through EEO ADR 
can  be  made  the  subject  of  an  EEO  complaint.    Likewise,  an  agency’s  decision 
not to offer  EEO  ADR for a particular  case, or an agency’s  failure to  provide a 
neutral, cannot be made the subject of an EEO complaint.   

I. 

Collective Bargaining Agreements and the Privacy Act  

Agencies  must  be  mindful  of  obligations  they  may  have  under  collective 
bargaining  agreements  to  discuss  development  of  EEO  ADR  programs  with 
representatives of appropriate bargaining units.  Agencies must also be mindful of 
the  prohibitions  of  disclosing  information  about  individuals  pursuant  to  the 

Management Directive 
3-9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Privacy Act.  All pre- and post-complaint information is contained in a system of 
records  subject  to  the  Act.    Unless  the  complaining  party  elects  union 
representation  or  gives  his/her  written  consent,  such  information,  including  the 
fact that a particular person has sought counseling or filed a complaint, cannot be 
disclosed to the union.   

J. 

Recordkeeping 

Pursuant to the Commission’s   authority set forth  in 29  C.F.R.  § 1614.602(a) to 
collect federal complaints processing data and pursuant to the agency’s obligation 
to report EEO  activity to the Commission, the  Commission requires agencies to 
maintain a record of EEO ADR activity for annual reporting to the  Commission 
no later than October 31 of each  year.  This information will be provided to the 
Commission on the Form 462. 

K. 

Independent ADR Office 

In this Management Directive  

an  “Independent  ADR  Office”  refers  to  an  office  that  functions 
independently  of  the  traditional  EEO  Office.    In  addition  to  EEO 
disputes,  an  Independent  ADR  Office  may  attempt  to  informally 
resolve  a  variety  of  workplace  concerns,  such  as,  grievances,  or 
general employee disagreements.2

The Commission encourages the implementation of an Independent ADR Office 
as a best practice.  A primary advantage of an Independent ADR Office is that the 
agencies can resolve disputes that do not belong in the EEO process, which then 
permits the EEO staff to focus on the traditional EEO complaint process.  While 
employees may go directly to the Independent ADR Office without first meeting 
with  the  EEO  Counselor,  an  independent  ADR  office  is  not  an  office  for  the 
purpose of initiating the EEO process.  As a result, during the first contact with an 
Independent ADR Office, the aggrieved individual must be informed of the need 
to  contact  an  EEO  Counselor  and  regulatory  time  frames,  should  they  wish  to 
protect their rights to take the matter through the traditional EEO process.  

Where an agency permits ADR office  employees to perform any collateral EEO 
duty  (no  matter  how  small  or  infrequent),  the  ADR  office  is  no  longer 
independent and therefore any contact by an aggrieved party with the ADR office 
staff  will  initiate  the  traditional  EEO  process,  including  EEO  counseling  and

Form  462  reporting.    The  agency’s  ADR  staff  member  must  provide  to  the 
aggrieved person the same information EEO Counselors are required to provide to 
the aggrieved persons, meet all training requirements of an EEO Counselor, and 
fully  carry  out  the  EEO  Counselor’s  roles  and  responsibilities.    This  includes 
providing the EEO Counselor’s report to the EEO Office for issuance in a timely 
manner.  The ninety (90) day pre-complaint processing period will begin from the 
first contact with the ADR office staff member.  Furthermore, an EEO Counselor 
may  not  act  as  a  neutral  in  a  case  where  s/he  has  previously  provided  EEO 
counseling.    (See  Chapter  2,  Section  I.E  of  this  Management  Directive  for 
guidance on the qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of an EEO Counselor). 

IV.  PROVIDING INFORMATION 

Aggrieved persons need information about all aspects of EEO ADR in order to make an 
informed  choice  between  EEO  ADR  and  the  traditional  EEO  complaint  process.    The 
information  provided  at  the  counseling  stage  largely  determines  whether  aggrieved 
persons will utilize the EEO ADR process.  As such, EEO ADR programs should ensure 
that  aggrieved  persons  are  informed  of  all  of  the  various  steps  in  the  traditional  EEO 
process  before  beginning  the  actual  EEO  ADR  proceeding.    The  aggrieved  persons 
should  also  learn  about  the  benefits  of  resolving  the  EEO  dispute  through  EEO  ADR.  
Although  an  informed  choice  is  necessary  to  conduct  an  EEO  ADR  proceeding,  an 
additional value is that once aggrieved persons choose EEO ADR over other alternatives, 
they have made a commitment to its success. 

A. 

Agencies Must Fully Inform Employees about the EEO Process 

29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(b)(2), which covers pre-complaint processing, requires that 
the  EEO  Counselor  advise  the  aggrieved  person  that  s/he  may  choose  between 
participation in the EEO ADR program offered by the agency and the traditional 
EEO  counseling  procedures.    Before  the  aggrieved  person  makes  a  choice 
between  counseling  and  EEO  ADR,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  fully  inform  the 
person about the stages of the EEO process.  (See Chapter 2 of this Management 
Directive).  The EEO Counselor also must also advise the aggrieved person about 
other  appropriate  statutory  or  regulatory  forums,  such  as  the  Merit  Systems 
Protection Board or a negotiated grievance process.

Providing Information about the EEO ADR Program 

1. 

The EEO Counselor should provide the aggrieved person with information 
about  the  agency  EEO  ADR  program,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the 
following: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

A  definition  of  the  term  EEO  “alternative  dispute  resolution 
(ADR)” – (the definitions in this Chapter can be used); 

An explanation of the stages in the EEO process where EEO ADR 
is available; 

A  thorough  description  of  the  particular  EEO  ADR  technique(s) 
used in the agency’s program; 

A thorough description of how the program is consistent with the 
EEO ADR core principles in ensuring fairness (including the right 
requires  voluntariness,  neutrality, 
representation),  which 
to 
confidentiality, and enforceability; 

An explanation of procedural and substantive alternatives; and 

Information  regarding  all  of  the  time  frames  involved  in  the 
traditional EEO complaint process and the EEO ADR process. 

2. 

aggrieved  person 

Information  about  the  agency’s  EEO  ADR  program  may  be  provided  to 
the 
through  discussions,  memoranda,  video 
presentations,  booklets,  or  pamphlets.    In  addition,  the  Commission 
recommends  that  agencies  issue  an  EEO  ADR  policy,  which  shows  the 
agency  head’s  support  of  the  EEO  ADR  program  and  encourages  all 
employees to participate in the program. 

C. 

Explaining the Benefits of EEO ADR 

To  encourage  the  aggrieved  persons  to  consider  participating  in  the  EEO  ADR 
program, they will need to understand the benefits of the EEO ADR process.  The 
Commission  recommends  that  the  EEO  ADR  program  prepare  talking  points  to 
promote  the  use  of  EEO  ADR.    In  particular,  agencies  could  identify  the 
following benefits of EEO ADR:   

1. 

2. 

EEO ADR saves time and money, as litigation and adjudication generally 
costs more and can takes years to reach a decision; 
Settlement agreements do not require admissions of liability; 

Management Directive 
3-12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

The parties maintain considerable control over the EEO ADR process and 
will decide their own outcome; 

Settlement agreements are more durable because there is buy-in from the 
parties; 

EEO  ADR  can  improve  office  morale  and  productivity  by  repairing  the 
parties’  relationship and  avoiding  the  tension  caused by  the  investigative 
process; and 

Unlike  decisions  which  are  published,  the  terms  of  the  settlement 
agreement are not routinely disclosed. 

D. 

Informing the Employee about Filing Rights 

Whether or not the aggrieved person chooses to participate in the agency’s EEO 
ADR  program,  the  EEO  Counselor  shall  advise  the  aggrieved  person  of  his/her 
rights and responsibilities in the EEO complaint process, as set forth in 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105(b). 

E. 

Pre-EEO ADR Meeting 

Once  the  matter is  accepted into the EEO ADR program,  either the neutral or a 
member  of  the  EEO  ADR  office  may  hold  a  pre-EEO  ADR  meeting.    The 
purpose of this meeting is to provide information about the EEO ADR proceeding 
and  address  preliminary  matters.    For  example,  the  meeting  could  clarify  the 
issues in dispute, determine the scope of authority among the participants, discuss 
the role of the representatives, and ask the parties to develop a list of the desired 
results that s/he would like to achieve through EEO ADR. 

V. 

NEUTRALS 

ADRA defines a neutral as “an individual who, with respect to an issue in controversy, 
functions specifically to aid the parties in resolving the controversy.”  5 U.S.C. § 571(9).  
The Act further states that a neutral is a:  

permanent or temporary officer or employee of the Federal Government or 
any other individual who is acceptable to the parties to a dispute resolution 
proceeding.  A neutral shall have no official, financial, or personal conflict 

Management Directive 
3-13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of interest with respect to the issues in controversy, unless such interest is 
fully disclosed in writing to all parties and all parties agree that the neutral 
may serve. 

5 U.S.C. § 573 (a). 

A. 

Sources of Neutrals 

EEO  ADR  proceedings  are  most  successful  where  a  neutral  or  impartial  third 
party,  with  no  vested  interest  in  the  outcome  of  a  dispute,  allows  the  parties 
themselves  to  attempt  to  resolve  their  dispute.    An  agency  should  also  consider 
the aggrieved person’s perception of the third party’s impartiality in appointing a 
neutral  for  an  EEO  ADR  proceeding.    For  the  neutral  to  be  effective,  the 
participants  in  an  EEO  ADR  program  must  perceive  the  neutral  as  completely 
impartial.  The selection of neutrals must comply with the core principles of ADR 
articulated in Section II above. 

An  agency  may  use  neutrals  for  its  EEO  ADR  program,  subject  to  their 
qualifications, from the following sources: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Other federal agencies/sub-components (through a federal neutral sharing 
program or other arrangement);  

Private  organizations,  private  contractors,  bar  associations,  or  individual 
volunteers; or 

Within their own agency, provided that they are impartial and independent 
of any control by either party, in both perception and reality. 

The  Commission  recommends  that  agencies  disclose  their  source  of  neutrals  to 
the  parties.    Many  federal  agencies  offer  external  sources  of  neutrals.    Federal 
Executive  Boards  (FEB)  throughout  the  nation  offer  pools  of  neutrals  who  are 
available  for  federal  agency  EEO  dispute  resolution.    Similarly,  the  Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) also provides neutrals throughout the 
country.    Within  the  metropolitan  Washington,  D.C.,  area,  the  Department  of 
Health  and  Human  Services  offers  an  interagency  mediation  program  called  the 
Sharing  Neutrals  Program.    This  program  operates  a  pool  of  trained  and 
experienced collateral-duty mediators who provide mediation services to agencies 
in  exchange  for  like  services  to  the  program  from  the  recipient  agency.    More 
information  about  these  programs  may  be  obtained  online  at  the  Commission’s 
federal sector ADR page.   
In  the  event  that  an  agency  uses  one  of  its  own  employees  as  a  neutral,  it  must 
ensure  the  neutrality  and  impartiality  of  the  neutral.    If  EEO  Counselors  and 

Management Directive 
3-14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

investigators are used as neutrals, the agency must ensure that they do not serve as 
a neutral in the same dispute in which they provided counseling or conducted an 
investigation.  Furthermore, an agency may use EEO Counselors and investigators 
as  neutrals  if,  and  only  if,  they  satisfy  the  minimum  training  requirements.   
Agencies  should  also  be  aware  that  having  EEO  Counselors  and  investigators 
switch roles between performing their traditional EEO duties and providing EEO 
ADR can be confusing to the aggrieved persons and to the EEO staff as to their 
role  in  a  particular  case.    To  avoid  this  confusion,  agencies  must  clearly 
communicate  to  the  aggrieved  persons  the  function  being  performed  by  the 
agency employee, whether EEO counseling, investigating, or EEO ADR.  To the 
extent  possible,  agencies  are  encouraged  to  designate  individuals  as  EEO 
Counselors/Investigators or  EEO  ADR neutrals,  and limit  the  switching  of roles 
between the EEO and EEO ADR programs.  

B. 

Qualifications of Neutrals 

1. 

Training in ADR Theory and Techniques  

training 

in  whatever  dispute 

Any  person  who  serves  as  a  neutral  in  an  agency’s  EEO  ADR  program 
resolution 
must  have  professional 
technique(s)  the  agency  utilizes  in  its  program.    The  Commission  will 
accept as sufficient such training as is generally recognized in the dispute 
resolution profession.  For example, the Interagency Program on Sharing 
Neutrals  administered  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services 
requires  the  following  expertise:  1)  at  least  20  hours  of  basic  mediation 
skills training; 2) at least three co-mediations with a qualified mediator or 
five  independent  mediations  and  positive  evaluations  from  a  qualified 
trainer/evaluator;  and  3)  at  least  two  references  from  two  qualified 
mediators or trainer/evaluators. 

2. 

Knowledge of EEO Law 

Any  person  who  serves  as  a  neutral  in  an  agency’s  EEO  ADR  program 
must be familiar with the following EEO laws and areas: 

a. 

b. 

The entire EEO process pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, including 
time frames;  

The Civil Service Reform Act and the statutes that the Commission 
enforces  (including  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as 
amended,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  as  amended,  the 

Management Directive 
3-15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  Amendments  Act  of  2008,  the 
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the 
Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, and the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008); 

c. 

d. 

The  theories  of  discrimination  (for  example,  disparate  treatment, 
adverse impact, harassment, and reasonable accommodation); and 

Remedies, including compensatory damages, costs, and attorney’s 
fees. 

C. 

Role of the Neutral 

In  any  EEO  ADR  proceeding  conducted  under  this  Directive,  the  neutral  is 
expected to be “neutral, honest, and to act in good faith.”  The neutral must also 
act consistently with the ADRA and strive to ensure: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

That  EEO ADR proceedings  are consistent with EEO law and  Part 1614 
regulations, including time frames; 

That  proceedings  are  fair  and  consistent  with  the  core  principles  in  this 
Chapter,  particularly  providing 
to  be 
represented  by  any  eligible  person  of  his/her  choosing  throughout  the 
proceeding (see Section III.G of this chapter for more information); 

the  opportunity 

the  parties 

That an agency representative participating in EEO ADR has the authority 
and  responsibility  to  negotiate  in  good  faith  and  that  a  person  with 
authority to approve or  enter into  a settlement agreement is accessible to 
the agency’s representative; 

That any agreement between the parties can be enforced, assist the parties 
in  preparation  of  the  written  settlement  agreement  that  includes  the 
signatures of the appropriate agency representative and aggrieved person, 
and inform the parties of the review process the agency uses to ensure the 
terms of the agreement are enforceable; 

Confidentiality,  including  destroying  all  written  notes  taken  during  the 
EEO ADR proceeding or in preparation for the proceeding; and 

Neutrality,  including  having  no  conflict  of  interest  with  respect  to  the 
proceeding  (for  example,  material  or  financial  interest  in  the  outcome, 
personal friend or co-worker of a party, supervisory official over a party), 

Management Directive 
3-16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

unless  such  interest  is  fully  disclosed  in  writing  to  the  parties  and  they 
agree that the neutral may serve. 

D. 

Promoting Trust 

Trust  fosters  the  open  and  frank  communication  between  the  parties  that  is  an 
essential  factor  in  reaching  a  fair  resolution  of  an  EEO  complaint.    Once  the 
individual  has  chosen  EEO  ADR  to  attempt  resolution,  the  neutral  can  develop 
the parties’ trust by: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Providing  full  information  about  the  EEO  ADR  proceeding  as  soon  as 
possible,  including  information  on  its  impartiality,  the  relative  merits  of 
EEO ADR as compared with the traditional form of complaint processing, 
and the confidentiality of the EEO ADR process; 

Giving  the  parties  the  opportunity  to  request  and  obtain  relevant 
information from one another, so that they have  sufficient information to 
make informed decisions; and 

Explaining  the  safeguards  that  are  in  place  to  protect  parties  from 
pressures to resolve the complaint. 

VI.  ADR TECHNIQUES 

Numerous  ADR  techniques  are  available  for  use  by  agencies  in  their  programs.    Each 
agency’s EEO ADR program should strive to use those ADR techniques which are a best 
fit  for  their  culture.    While  the  Commission  does  not  mandate  that  agencies  offer  any 
specific  ADR  techniques,  agencies  must  at  a  minimum  make  available  to  parties  one 
ADR  technique  which allows for the meaningful participation  of all involved parties in 
the  dispute.    Mediation,  facilitation,  and  settlement  conferences  are  common  ADR 
techniques which involve the participation of all parties to the dispute.   

Techniques may be combined to provide advantageous aspects of more than one method.  
For example, an agency may provide coaching to one or more of the parties as a way of 
preparing  parties  for  mediation.    Or,  an  agency  may  provide  coaching  as  one  of  the 
services after mediation.  However, coaching alone would not be sufficient, as it does not 
allow for meaningful participation of all parties to the dispute.  Agencies are not limited 
to using only one method or technique in their EEO ADR programs.  They may find that 
using various methods in combination may also yield fruitful results and be very effective 
in reaching resolution.  See the Federal Workplace Conflict Management Desk Reference 
at ADR.gov for a non-exhaustive list of ADR techniques. 

Management Directive 
3-17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A.  Mediation 

In this Management Directive the term 

“Mediation” refers to the process where a third-party neutral, who 
is  not  a  decision  maker,  facilitates  discussion  between  the  parties 
to help them reach a mutually acceptable resolution. 

In  a mediation the neutral guides the process and determines when to meet with 
both  parties  in  a  joint  session  or  individually,  establishes  a  tone  to  help  parties 
engage in meaningful discussion, and creates a safe environment for discussion. 

B. 

Facilitation 

Facilitation involves the use of techniques to improve the flow of information in a 
meeting  between  parties  to  a  dispute.    The  techniques  may  also  be  applied  to 
decision-making  meetings  where  a  specific  outcome  is  desired  (for  example, 
resolution  of  a  conflict  or  dispute).    The  term  “facilitator”  is  often  used 
interchangeably  with  the  term  “mediator,”  but  a  facilitator  does  not  typically 
become  as  involved  as  the  mediator  in  the  substantive  issues.    The  facilitator 
focuses more on the communication processes involved in resolving a matter. 

C. 

Settlement Conferences 

In a settlement conference, disputing parties, their representatives, and a judge or 
referee  hold  a  meeting  designed  to  bring  formal  adversarial  proceedings  to  a 
satisfactory close.  The role of a settlement judge is similar to that of a mediator in 
that s/he assists the parties procedurally in negotiating an agreement.   

VII.  RESOLUTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING 

If  the  agency  and  the  aggrieved  person  agree  to  a  resolution  of  the  matter,  the 
Commission regulations require that the terms of the resolution be in writing and signed 
by both parties to verify they have the same understanding of the terms of the resolution.  
See  29 C.F.R.  §  1614.603;  Chapter  12  of  this  Directive.    The  written  agreement  must 
state  clearly  the  terms  of  the  resolution  and  contain  the  procedures  available  under 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.504, in the event that the agency fails to comply with the terms of the 
resolution.    Written  agreements  must  comply  with  EEOC’s  Enforcement  Guidance  on 
Non-Waivable Employee Rights under Enforced Statutes, wherein the Commission sets 
forth its position that: 

Management Directive 
3-18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

“an agency may not interfere with the protected right of employees 
to file a complaint or participate in any manner in an investigation,

hearing,  or  proceeding  under 
Commission.”   

laws  enforced  by 

the 

Additionally,  any  written  agreement  settling  a  claim  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment Act (ADEA) must also comply with the requirements of the Older Workers 
Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA) Pub. L. No. 101- 433 (1990), the ADEA, 29 
U.S.C.  §  626(f),  and  the  Commission’s  regulations  regarding  Waiver  of  Rights  and 
Claims  under  the  ADEA  at  29  C.F.R.  Part  1625.    Neither  the  ADRA  nor  the 
Commission’s  core  principles  require  the  parties  to  agree  that  a  settlement  must  be 
confidential.   

The agency representative shall transmit a signed and dated copy of the resolution to the 
EEO  Director.    The  EEO  Director  shall  retain  the  copy  in  accordance  with  the 
appropriate National Archives and Records Administration schedules.

CHAPTER 4  
PROCEDURES FOR RELATED PROCESSES 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

As  noted  in  Chapter  2,  Section  IV.B  and  Appendix  D  of  this  Management  Directive, 
different  procedures  apply  to  certain  related  processes.    The  relationship  between 
29 C.F.R. Part 1614 EEO complaints, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) actions, 
grievances filed  pursuant to negotiated  grievance  procedures, notices of  intent  to sue in 
Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  (ADEA)  complaints,  and  the  alternative 
available in Equal Pay Act (EPA) complaints are set out more specifically here.  All time 
frames in this Chapter are expressed in calendar days. 

II.  MIXED CASE COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.302 

A. 

Definitions 

A “mixed case complaint” is a complaint of employment discrimination filed with 
a federal agency based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, 
genetic information, or reprisal related to or stemming from an action that may be 
appealed to the MSPB.  The complaint may contain only a claim of employment 
discrimination  or  it  may  contain  additional  non-discrimination  claims  that  the 
MSPB  has  jurisdiction  to  address.    A  “mixed  case  appeal”  is  an  appeal  filed 
directly  with  the  MSPB  that  alleges  that  an  appealable  agency  action  was 
effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, 
religion,  sex,  national  origin,  disability,  age,  genetic  information,  or  reprisal.   
There  is  no  right  to  a  hearing  before  a  Commission  Administrative  Judge  on  a 
mixed case complaint.   

B. 

Procedures 

The Commission regulations provide for processing discrimination complaints on 
claims that are otherwise appealable to the MSPB.  Two determinations must be 
made  to  decide  if  the  mixed  case  regulations  apply.    First,  the  employee  must 
have standing to file such an appeal with the MSPB.  Second, the claim that forms 
the basis of the discrimination complaint must be appealable to the MSPB.  For 
information on who can file and the actions that can be appealed to the MSPB see 
5 C.F.R. § 1201.3.  Note that because the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to hear 
non-appealable  matters,  complaints  not  containing  those  matters  should  be 

Management Directive 
4-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
processed by the agency under the 1614 process and not mixed with matters that 
are  appealable  to  the  MSPB  through  amendment,  consolidation  or  held  in 
abeyance.    See  Complainant  v.  Inter-American  Foundation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120132968, (Jan. 8, 2014) (wherein the Commission  essentially  overturned the 
doctrine of  inextricably intertwined).  We note, however,  that a proposed  action 
merges  with  the  decision  on  an  appealable  matter  -  for  example,  a  proposed 
removal  merges  into  the  decision  to  remove.    See  Wilson  v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans 
Affairs, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122103 (September 10, 2012). 

1. 

Election to Proceed Is Required 

a. 

b. 

c. 

The regulations provide that a covered individual may raise claims 
of  discrimination  in  a  mixed  case  either  as  a  direct  appeal  to  the 
MSPB or as a mixed case EEO complaint with the agency, but not 
both.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(b). 

Whatever action the individual files first is considered an election 
to proceed in that forum.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(b).  Filing a formal 
EEO  complaint  constitutes  an  election  to  proceed  in  the  EEO 
  Contacting  an  EEO  Counselor  or  receiving  EEO 
forum. 
counseling does not constitute an election. 

Where an aggrieved person files an MSPB appeal and timely seeks 
counseling,  counseling  may  continue  pursuant  to  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105,  at  the  option  of  the  parties.    In  any  case,  counseling 
must  be  terminated  with  notice  of  rights  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§§ 1614.105(d), (e), or (f).

Procedures for Handling Dual Filing 

a. 

Where the agency does not dispute MSPB jurisdiction   

(1) 

If  an  individual  files  a  mixed  case  appeal  with  the  MSPB 
before filing a mixed case complaint with the agency, and 
the agency does not dispute MSPB jurisdiction, the agency 
must  thereafter  dismiss  any  complaint  on  the  same  claim, 
regardless  of  whether  the  claims  of  discrimination  are 
raised in the appeal to the MSPB.1

1 A Commission Administrative Judge may dismiss the mixed case complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 

§ 1614.109(b).

b. 

Where  the  agency  or  the  MSPB  Administrative  Judge  questions 
MSPB jurisdiction  

The agency shall hold the mixed case complaint in abeyance until 
the  MSPB  Administrative  Judge  rules  on  the  jurisdictional  issue, 
notify  the  complainant  that  it  is  doing  so,  and  instruct  him/her  to 
bring  the  discrimination  claim  to  the  attention  of  the  MSPB.  
During this period, all time limitations for processing or filing the 
complaint will be tolled.  An agency decision to hold a mixed case 
complaint in abeyance is not appealable to the Commission.  If the 
MSPB Administrative Judge finds that MSPB has jurisdiction over 
the claim, the  agency shall  dismiss the mixed case complaint and 
advise the complainant of the right to petition the Commission to 
review  the  MSPB’s  final  decision  on  the  discrimination  issue.    If 
the  MSPB  Administrative  Judge  finds  that  the  MSPB  does  not 
have  jurisdiction  over  the  claim,  the  agency  shall  recommence 
processing of the mixed case complaint as a non-mixed case EEO 
complaint. 

c. 

Where a complainant files with the agency first 

If an employee first files a mixed case complaint at the agency and 
then files a mixed case appeal with the MSPB, the agency should 
advise  the  MSPB  of  the  prior  agency  filing  and  request  that  the 
MSPB dismiss the appeal without prejudice.

Processing  Where  MSPB Dismisses a Mixed  Case Appeal Because  It 
Finds No Jurisdiction (That Is, the Case Is Not Mixed) 

a.  

b. 

If an individual files a mixed case appeal with the MSPB instead of 
a mixed case complaint, and the MSPB subsequently dismisses the 
appeal as non-jurisdictional, the agency must inform the individual 
that  s/he  may  contact  an  EEO  Counselor  within  forty-five  (45) 
days to raise the discrimination claim(s) and that the filing date of 
the mixed case appeal will be deemed to be the date the individual 
initially contacted the EEO Counselor.   

If the individual filed the appeal after the agency issued an agency 
final  decision  on  the  mixed  case  complaint  or  after  the  agency 
failed to issue a final decision on the mixed case complaint within 
120 days, (pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.154(b)(2)), the agency must 
provide the complainant with a thirty (30) day notice of right to a 
hearing and decision from a Commission Administrative Judge or 
an  immediate  final  decision  by  the  agency  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(f) and thereafter proceed as in a non-mixed case. 

4. 

Processing Mixed Case Complaints Filed at the Agency 

If  an  employee  elects  to  file  a  mixed  case  complaint,  the  agency  must 
process  the  complaint  in  the  same  manner  as  it  would  any  other 
discrimination complaint, except: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Upon  completion  of  the investigation,  the  agency  must  notify  the 
complainant  that  a  final  decision  will  be  issued  within  forty-five 
(45)  days  without  a  hearing  before  a  Commission  Administrative 
Judge.   

Upon  the  filing  of  a  complaint,  the  agency  must  advise  the 
complainant that if a final decision is not issued within 120 days of 
the  date of filing the mixed case  complaint, the  complainant may 
appeal the claim to the MSPB at any time thereafter, as specified in 
5 C.F.R.  §§  1201.154(a)  &  (b),  or  may  file  a  civil  action  as 
specified in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.310(g), but not both. 

Also  upon  the  filing  of  a  complaint,  the  agency  must  notify  the 
complainant  that  if  s/he  is  dissatisfied  with  the  agency’s  final 
decision on the mixed case complaint, s/he may appeal the claim to 
the MSPB (not the Commission) within thirty (30) days of receipt 
of the agency’s final decision pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 1201.154(a).

Upon  issuance  of  the  agency’s  final  decision  on  a  mixed  case 
complaint, the agency must advise the complainant of the right to 
appeal  the  claim  to  the  MSPB  (not  the  Commission)  within  30 
days of receipt of the notice and of the right to file a civil action as 
provided in 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.310 and 1614.310(a). 

III.  NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.301 

A.  Where Agency Is Covered by 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d) 

1. 

2. 

When  an  aggrieved  employee  is  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining 
agreement  that  permits  claims  of  discrimination  to  be  raised  in  a 
negotiated  grievance  procedure,  the  employee  must  elect  to  file  an  EEO 
complaint  or  a  grievance.    The  underlying  principle  is  that  an  aggrieved 
employee  who  has  a  choice  of  forums  in  which  to  proceed  cannot  go 
forward in more than one forum (unless the employing agency is exempt 
from  coverage  of  5 U.S.C.  §  7121(d)).    This  is  true  “irrespective  of 
whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to elect or of 
whether  the  grievance  has  raised  an  issue  of  discrimination.”    29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.301(a). 

If  an  employee  first  files  a  grievance  and  thereafter  files  a  complaint  of 
discrimination  on  the  same  claim,  the  complaint  must  be  dismissed 
without  prejudice  to  the  complainant’s  right  to  proceed  through  the 
negotiated  grievance  procedure,  including  the  right  to  appeal  to  the 
Commission from a final decision as provided in subpart D of Part 1614 
(Appeals and Civil Actions).  The dismissal of the complaint must advise 
the  complainant  of  the  obligation  to  raise  discrimination  claims  in  the 
grievance process and of the right to appeal the final grievance decision to 
the Commission.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.301(a). 

Management Directive

B.  Where Agency Is Not Covered by 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d) 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The U.S. Postal Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority are examples 
of two agencies not covered by 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d).  In such agencies, an 
aggrieved individual may file a complaint pursuant to Part 1614 and also a 
grievance  pursuant  to  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  involving  the 
same claim. 

In  such  agencies,  complaints  filed  pursuant  to  Part  1614  may  be  held  in 
abeyance where a grievance is filed on the same claim, if written notice of 
the abeyance is provided. 

Complaints may be held in abeyance until a final decision is issued on the 
grievance. 

C. 

Administrative Grievance Process 

There is nothing that prevents an employee from using an agency’s administrative 
process,  as  opposed  to  a  negotiated  grievance  process,  and  the  EEO  complaint 
process.    See  Diefenderfer  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01980578, (Oct. 7, 1998).   However, the Commission has  consistently  held that 
utilization of agency procedures, union grievances, and other remedial processes 
does not toll the time limit for contacting an EEO Counselor.  See Black v. Dep’t. 
of the Interior, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110122 (Aug. 19, 2011). 

IV.  AGE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS 

It is incumbent upon federal agency personnel responsible for processing discrimination 
complaints to inform complainants or potential complainants of the following procedures 
available to them in pursuing an age discrimination complaint. 

A. 

Election of Administrative Process 

An aggrieved person may file an administrative age discrimination complaint with 
the agency pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  If the aggrieved person elects to file 
an  administrative  complaint,  s/he  must  exhaust  administrative  remedies  before 
s/he  may  file  a civil action in U.S.  District  Court.  Exhaustion  of administrative 
remedies  occurs  when  the  agency  takes  final  action  or  180  days  after  filing  the 
complaint if no final action is taken.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.201; see also Chapter 
9, Sections II and III of this Management Directive.

B. 

Aggrieved May Bypass Administrative Process 

Alternatively,  an  aggrieved  person  may  bypass  the  administrative  complaint 
process,  and  file  a  civil  action  directly  in  U.S.  District  Court  provided  that  the 
aggrieved person first provides the Commission with a written notice of intent to 
sue  under  the  ADEA.    The  notice  to  the  Commission  must  be  filed  within  180 
days  of  the  date  of  the  alleged  discriminatory  action.    Once  a  timely  notice  of 
intent to sue is filed with the Commission, the aggrieved person must wait at least 
thirty (30) days before filing a civil action. 

C. 

Responsibilities Regarding Notices of Intent to Sue 

The  following  is  a  statement  of  the  procedures  and  a  delineation  of  the 
responsibilities  on  the  part  of  the  aggrieved  person,  the  Commission,  and  the 
agency with respect to the filing and processing of notices of intent to sue under 
the ADEA. 

1. 

The Aggrieved Person  

It is the responsibility of the aggrieved person to provide the Commission 
with  a  written  notice  of  intent  to  sue  within  180  days  of  the  date  of  the 
alleged discriminatory action.   

a. 

Notices  of  intent  to  sue  must  be  delivered  to  the  Commission  in 
one of the following ways: 

hand delivered to: 

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
Office of Federal Operations  
Federal Sector Programs  
131 M Street, NE 
Washington, DC  20507 

or mailed to:

or  may  soon  be  submitted  through  the  Commission’s  electronic 
document submission portal or fax at (202) 663-7022. 

b. 

The  notice  of  intent  to  sue  should  be  dated  and  must  contain  the 
following information: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

statement of intent to file a civil action under Section 15(d) 
of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as 
amended; 

name,  address,  and  telephone  number  of  the  employee  or 
applicant; 

name, address, and telephone number of the complainant’s 
designated representative, if any; 

name  and  location  of  the  federal  agency  or  installation 
where the alleged discriminatory action occurred; 

(5) 

date on which the alleged discriminatory action occurred; 

(6) 

(7) 

statement  of  the  nature  of  the  alleged  discriminatory 
action(s); and 

signature  of 
representative. 

the  complainant  or 

the  complainant’s 

2. 

The Commission 

a. 

Upon  receipt  of  a  notice  of  intent  to  sue,  the  Commission  will 
promptly  notify  the  concerned  agency  (and  all  persons  named  in 
the  notice  as  prospective  defendants  in  the  action,  if  any),  in 
writing, of its receipt of the notice of intent to sue and will provide 
the agency with a copy of the notice.  Commission contact with the 
concerned  agency  will  normally  be 
the  agency-
headquarters-level  Office  of  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  or 
similarly  designated  office,  as  the  case  may  be.    A  copy  of  the 
Commission’s  notification  will  be  provided  to  the  aggrieved 
person  and/or  his/her  representative,  if  any.    Additionally,  the 
Commission  will  take  any  appropriate  action  to  ensure  the 
elimination of any unlawful practice.

EEO MD-110 

b. 

Where  an  aggrieved  person  files  a  civil  action  before  the  agency 
has completed its inquiry, or before the Commission has reviewed 
the  agency’s  disposition,  the  Commission  will  terminate  the 
inquiry  and  will  take  no  further  action  on  the  notice  of  intent  to 
sue. 

3. 

The Agency 

Upon  receipt  of  a  notice  of  intent  to  sue,  an  agency  must  review  the 
claim(s)  of  age  discrimination  and  conduct  an  inquiry  sufficient  to 
determine whether there is evidence that unlawful age discrimination has 
occurred.  Agencies may determine their method of review/inquiry and the 
method  may  vary  depending  on  the  scope  and  complexity  of  the  claims.   
Agencies are encouraged to make good faith efforts to resolve disputes. 

V. 

EQUAL PAY ACT COMPLAINTS  

An aggrieved individual does not have to file an administrative complaint before filing a 
lawsuit under the Equal Pay Act (EPA).  If an aggrieved individual nonetheless wants to 
file an administrative complaint, it will be processed like Title VII complaints under Part 
1614.    Complainants  in  EPA  cases  should  be  notified  of  the  statute  of  limitations  (two 
years or, if a willful violation is alleged, three years), which applies even if the individual 
files an administrative complaint, and of the right to file directly in a court of competent 
jurisdiction without first providing notice to the Commission or exhausting administrative 
remedies. 

Management Directive 
4-9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 5  
AGENCY PROCESSING OF FORMAL COMPLAINTS 

I. 

AGENCY SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE FORMAL COMPLAINT 

Immediately  upon  receipt  of  a  formal  complaint  of  discrimination,  the  agency  shall 
acknowledge  receipt  of  the  complaint  in  writing.    The  acknowledgment  letter  shall 
inform the complainant of the date on which the complaint was filed.  If the complaint is 
mailed,  the  date  of  filing  is  the  postmark  date,  not  the  date  the  agency  received  the 
complaint.  Where the matter is appropriate for ADR, the agency may include a notice to 
that effect in its acknowledgment letter. 

Commission regulations  require that an EEO Counselor provide both the agency office 
designated to accept complaints and the complainant with a written report within fifteen 
(15)  days  of  being  advised  that  the  complainant  has  filed  a  formal  EEO  complaint.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(c).  Agencies thus should immediately notify  the EEO Counselor 
that a complainant has filed a complaint so as to expedite the preparation and delivery of 
the written report.   

Within a  reasonable  time  after  receipt of the written EEO Counselor report, the agency 
should  send  the  complainant  a  second  letter  (commonly  referred  to  as  an  "acceptance" 
letter),  stating  the  claim(s)  asserted  and  to  be  investigated.    If  the  second  letter’s 
statement of the claim(s) asserted and claim(s) for investigation differs, the letter further 
shall explain the reasons for the difference, including whether the agency is dismissing a 
portion of the complaint.  The agency shall advise the complainant that s/he may submit a 
statement  to  the  agency  concerning  the  agency’s  articulation  of  the  claim,  which  shall 
become  a  part  of  the  complaint  file.    (Dismissals  are  governed  by  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a).  Additional dismissal guidance is provided in Section IV of this Chapter 
of  the  Management  Directive.)    The  agency  shall  notify  the  complainant  of  a  partial 
dismissal by letter and further inform the complainant that there is no immediate right to 
appeal  the partial dismissal.   The agency should  advise the  complainant that  the partial 
dismissal  shall  be  reviewed  either  by  a  Commission  Administrative  Judge,  if  the 
complainant requests a hearing before an Administrative Judge, or by the Commission, if 
the complainant  files an  appeal of  a final  agency  action  or  final  agency  decision.   (See 
Section IV.C below for further discussion on the requirements of a partial dismissal.)   

Unless  the  complainant  states  otherwise,  copies  of  the  acknowledgment  and  all 
subsequent  actions  on  the  complaint  shall  be  mailed  or  delivered  to  the  complainant’s 
representative with a copy to the complainant.

II. 

THE AGENCY SHALL ALSO PROVIDE OTHER INFORMATION AND 
NOTICE OF RIGHTS 

A. 

Agency Shall Inform the Complainant of the Agency’s Obligations 

1. 

To Investigate in a Timely Manner 

The  agency  is  required  to  investigate  the  complaint  in  a  timely  manner.   
The  investigation  must  be  appropriate,  impartial,  and  completed  within 
180 days of filing the complaint (as described more fully in Section V.D 
and in Chapter 6 of this Directive), or within the time period contained in 
an  order  from  the  Office  of  Federal  Operations  on  an  appeal  from  a 
dismissal  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.107(a).    The  EEO  Director  or 
designee  and  the  complainant  may  agree  in  writing,  consistent  with  29 
C.F.R. § 1614.108(e), to an extension of not more than ninety (90) days; 
or  within  the  period  of  time  set  forth  in  29  C.F.R.  §§  1614.108(e)  or 
1614.606  if  there  are  multiple  complainants  with  similar  allegations  of 
discrimination  or  complainant  has  filed  multiple  complaints  which  the 
agency has consolidated.  If the agency fails to complete the investigation 
in  180  days,  it  shall  issue  written  notice  to  complainant  informing  the 
complainant that it was unable to complete the investigation, the estimated 
date of completion, and complainant’s right to file a civil action or request 
a  hearing.    See  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.108(g).    See  Appendix  K  for  a  sample 
notice letter. 

Agencies are required to complete investigations within the earlier of 180 
days after the filing of the last complaint or 360 days after the filing of the 
original  complaint.    Regardless  of  amendment  or  consolidation  of 
complaints, the investigation shall be complete in not more than 360 days, 
unless there is a written extension of not more than 90 days.   

For  example,  if  a  complainant  amends  a  complaint  or  files  another 
complaint, the  agency will consolidate on day 179 of the originally filed 
complaint, and then the investigation must be complete by the 359th day.   

If the  complainant wants  to add another amendment on the  358th day of 
the  investigation,  the  agency  will  have  only  2  days  to  investigate  that 
amendment unless the complainant agrees in writing to an extension of not 
more  than  90  days.    When  no  written  extension exists  and the  agency  is 
unable  to  conduct  an  impartial  and  appropriate  investigation  in  2  days  it 
should not consolidate or accept the amendment rather; the agency should 
advise  the  complainant  to  seek  counseling  on  the  newest  matter  and 
process it as a new complaint. 

Management Directive 
5-2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An investigation is deemed completed when the report of the investigation 
is served on the complainant in conjunction with the notice of the right to 
elect either a hearing before a Commission Administrative Judge or a final 
decision from the agency pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(f). 

2. 

To Process Mixed Cases Timely 

The Commission deems a mixed case complaint timely investigated in the 
same manner and applying the same time limitations as non-mixed cases.  
However,  if  a  final  decision  is  not  issued  on  the  mixed  case  complaint 
within  120  days  of  filing,  the  complainant  may  appeal  to  the  Merit 
Systems  Protection  Board  (MSPB)  at  any  time  thereafter  pursuant  to 
MSPB  regulation  5  C.F.R.  § 1201.154(a)  or  may  file  a  civil  action  as 
provided  in  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.310(g),  but  not  both.    See  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.302(d)(1).  The complainant is not entitled to a hearing before the 
Commission on a mixed case.  See more instructions for processing these 
cases in Chapter 4 Section II. 

3. 

Unilateral Extension for Sanitizing Classified Information  

After  providing  notice  to  the  complainant,  the  agency  may  unilaterally 
extend the time period or any period of extension for no more than thirty 
(30)  days  where  it  must  sanitize  a  complaint  file  that  may  contain 
information  classified  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  12356  or  successor 
orders  as  secret  in  the  interest  of  national  defense  or  foreign  policy.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(e). 

B. 

Agency Shall Inform Complainant of His/Her Rights 

The  agency  shall  provide  every  complainant  in  writing  notice  of  all  rights  and 
responsibilities enumerated in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of this Management Directive.  
This includes: 

1. 

The Right to Request a Hearing 

Except in mixed cases, the complainant has the right to request a hearing 
before a Commission Administrative Judge after 180 calendar days from 
the  filing  of  a  formal  complaint  or  after  completion  of  the  investigation, 
whichever comes first.   29 C.F.R.  § 1614.106(e)(2).  Complainants must 
request  a  hearing  directly  from  the  Commission’s  field  office  that  has 
jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the complaint arose, as set 
forth  in  Appendix  N  of  this  Management  Directive.    See  29  C.F.R.

request is to be sent as well as the agency office to which the copy of the 
request  should  be  sent.

 AGENCIES MUST AVOID FRAGMENTING EEO COMPLAINTS 

The fragmentation, or breaking up, of a complainant’s legal claim during EEO complaint 
processing  has  been  a  significant  problem  in  the  federal  sector.    For  complainants, 
fragmented processing can compromise their ability to present an integrated and coherent 
claim of an unlawful employment practice for which there is a remedy under the federal 
equal  employment  statutes.    For  agencies  and  the  Commission,  fragmented  processing 
substantially increases case inventories and workloads when it results in the processing of 
related matters as separate complaints.1

The  fragmentation  of  EEO  claims  must  be  prevented  at  all  levels  of  the  complaint 
process, including  pre-complaint EEO counseling.    This section is  designed  to  promote 

1  See  Cobb  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Treasury,  EEOC  Request  No.  05970077  (Mar.  13,  1997);  Toole  v. 

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC Appeal No. 01964702 (May 22, 1997).

understanding  of  the  concept  of  fragmentation  and  to  provide  guidance  on  avoiding 
fragmented complaint processing. 

Note that  because the MSPB does not have  jurisdiction  to  hear non-appealable matters, 
complaints  not  containing  those  matters  should  be  processed  by  the  agency  under  the 
1614  process  and  not  mixed  with  matters  that  are  appealable  to  the  MSPB  through 
amendment,  consolidation  or  held  in  abeyance.    See  Complainant  v.  Inter-American 
Foundation,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120132968,  (Jan.  8,  2014)  (wherein  the  Commission 
essentially overturned the doctrine of inextricably intertwined).  We note, however, that a 
proposed  action  merges  with  the  decision  on  an  appealable  matter  -  for  example,  a 
proposed removal merges into the decision to remove.  See Wilson v. Dep’t. of Veterans 
Affairs, EEOC Appeal No. 0120122103 (September 10, 2012). 

This section is not designed to address claims that include both a mixed and non-mixed 
matters.    Where  the  complainant  has  or  brings  an  amendment  which  contains  a  mixed 
issue  (one  that  can  be  appealed  directly  to  the  MSPB),  fragmentation  does  not  occur 
where  the  agency  assigns  a  second  complaint  number  and  processes  the  non-mixed 
matters under the 29 C.F.R. 1614 process and the mixed matters under the 5 C.F.R. 1201 
process.   

A. 

Identifying and Defining the Claim in an EEO Complaint 

1. 

Fragmentation  often  occurs  at  the  point  where  the  agency  identifies  and 
defines  the  complainant’s  claim,  most  commonly  during  the  counseling 
and  investigative  stages.    A  claim  refers  to  an  assertion  of  an  unlawful 
employment  practice  or  policy  for  which,  if  proven,  there  is  a  remedy 
under the federal equal employment statutes.  Fragmentation often results 
from a failure to distinguish between the claim the complainant is raising 
and  the  evidence  (factual  information)  s/he  is  offering  in  support  of  that 
claim.   

Example 1 

An African-American employee complains to the EEO Counselor 
that  his  supervisor  is  stricter  about  his  time  and  attendance  than 
with the unit’s Caucasian employees.  This is a legal claim of race-
based  disparate  treatment  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
complainant’s employment with regard to time and attendance.  In 
support  of  this  claim,  the  complainant  tells  the  EEO  Counselor 
about a number of different occasions when the supervisor denied 
his  request  for  annual leave or required him to  use leave because 
he  was 
treating  similarly  situated  Caucasian 
employees  more  favorably.    These  specific  incidents  should  be 
considered  the  evidence  supporting  the  complainant’s  claim  that 

tardy,  while 

Management Directive 
5-6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  supervisor  is treating him  differently because  of  his  race with 
regard  to  his  time  and  attendance.    Fragmentation  would  occur  if 
each of these incidents were considered a separate claim and processed 
as a separate complaint. 

Example 2 

A  female  employee  complains  to  the  EEO  Counselor  that  she  is 
being subjected to a hostile work environment due to the ongoing 
sexual harassment by her male co-workers.  This is the complain-
ant’s legal claim.  In support of this claim, the complainant tells the 
EEO Counselor of specific incidents of a sexual advance, a sexual 
joke and a comment of a sexual nature.  These individual incidents 
are evidence in support of the complainant’s claim and should not 
be considered as separate claims in and of themselves.   

2. 

Often,  when  an  agency identifies each  piece of  factual  evidence (usually 
constituting a single incident) offered by the complainant as a separate and 
distinct legal claim, it ignores the complainant’s real underlying issue of a 
pattern  of  ongoing  discrimination.2
    In  contrast,  fragmentation  rarely 
occurs  when  the  complainant  presents  a  legal  claim  based  on  a  single 
incident (such as a particular selection decision or a termination decision) 
rather than a series of events. 

In defining a legal claim, the agency must exercise care where a series of 
incidents  offered  by  a  complainant  initially  seem  different  from  one 
another.  

2 See, for example, Reid  v.  Dep’t. of Commerce, EEOC Request No. 05970705 (Apr. 22, 1999); 
Ferguson  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Request  No.  05970792  (Mar.  30,  1999);  Manalo  v.  Dep’t.  of  the 
Navy, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01960764 and 01963676 (Nov. 5, 1996), request for reconsideration denied, 
EEOC Request No. 05970254 (May 29, 1998).

Example 3 

A  complainant  tells  the EEO  Counselor  that  she  believes  that  the 
agency discriminated  against her when  she was not selected for a 
GS-14 Engineer position, when she was not detailed to serve in a 
similar  position,  and  when  she  was  denied  access  to  a  particular 
training  program.    All  of  these  seemingly  different  incidents  are 
part  of  the  same  claim  of  a  discriminatory  non-selection  as  the 
complainant has alleged that the detail and the training would have 
enhanced  her  qualifications  for  the  GS-14  Engineer  position  and, 
therefore, are relevant to the agency’s failure to select her for that 
position. 

Practice  Tip:    When  defining  a  claim,  two  components  must  be 
identified.    First,  the  claim  must  contain  a  factual  statement  of  the 
employment practice or policy being challenged.  As already discussed, it 
is  critical  that  EEO  Counselors,  investigators,  and  other  EEO  staff 
members ensure that they understand the exact nature of the complainant’s 
concerns  so  that  the  employment  practice  is  defined  broadly  enough  to 
reflect  any  allegation  of  a  pattern  of  ongoing  discrimination.    Particular 
attention  should  be  given  to  claims  involving  terms  and  conditions  of 
employment.    In  Example  1  above,  the  employment  practice  being 
challenged is: disparate treatment in terms and conditions of employment 
with  regard  to  time  and  attendance  polices.    In  Example  2  above,  the 
employment  practice  is:  the  creation  of  a  hostile  work  environment 
because  of  sexual  harassment.    In  Example  3  above,  the  employment 
practice  might  be  defined  as:  management’s  failure  to  advance  the 
complainant’s  career  to  a  GS-14  position.    The  second  component  of  a 
legal  claim  is  the  identification  of  the  basis  (because  of  race,  color, 
national  origin,  sex,  religion,  reprisal,  age,  disability,  or  genetic 
information) for a violation of an equal employment statute. 

3. 

Timeliness  Issues:    One  of  the  reasons  the  distinction  between  legal 
claims  and  supporting  evidence  is  important  is  because  complainants 
frequently  raise  factual  incidents  that  occur  outside  of  the  45-day  time 
period for contacting an EEO Counselor.  In general, for a legal claim to 
be  timely  raised,  at  least  one  of  the  incidents  the  complainant  cites  as 
evidence in support of his/her claim must have occurred within the 45-day 
time  period  for  contacting  an  EEO  Counselor.    (The  usual  exceptions 
should still be made.  See Section IV of this Chapter on dismissals.)  If the 
claim itself is timely raised, the question remains as to how the agency is 
to  treat  those  factual  incidents  that  the  complainant  cited  as  evidence  in 
support of his/her claim that occurred outside the 45-day time limit.   

Management Directive 
5-8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The  answer  is  that  an  agency  must  consider,  at  least  as  background,  all 
relevant evidence offered in support of a timely raised legal claim, even if 
the  evidence  involves  incidents  that  occurred  outside  the  45-day  time 
limit.    This  is  true  of  supporting  evidence  that  the  complainant  offered 
during EEO counseling as well as later in the investigative stage.  During 
the investigation, the degree to which a certain piece of proffered evidence 
is  relevant  to  the  legal  claim  will  determine  what  sort  of  investigation  is 
necessary  of  that  particular  piece  of  evidence.    For  example,  in  a  non-
selection  case,  a  selection  decision  made  long  before  the  one  at  issue, 
involving  different  agency  officials,  may  have  little  relevance  to  the 
current  claim.    On  the  other  hand,  if  the  selecting  official  in  the  most 
recent  non-selection  also  failed  to  select  the  complainant  for  a  similar 
position six months before, that piece of evidence may be very relevant to 
the  complainant’s  claim.    Investigators  should  not  simply  disregard 
relevant information the complainant provided in support of his/her claim 
as  untimely  raised;  nor  should  they  send  the  complainant  back  to 
counseling as if the supporting evidence was a new claim to be processed 
as a separate complaint.   

With  regard  to  the  timeliness  of  a  claim  of  harassment,  because  the 
incidents  that  make  up  a  harassment  claim  collectively  constitute  one 
unlawful employment practice, the claim is actionable, as long as at least 
one  incident  that  is  part  of  the  claim  occurred  within  the  filing  period.   
Such a claim can include incidents that occurred outside the filing period 
that  the  complainant  knew  or  should  have  known  were  actionable  at  the 
time  of  their  occurrence.    See  Bulluck  v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans  Affairs, 
EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120114276  (Mar.  14,  2012);  Richardson  v.  U.S. 
Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111122 (Feb. 1, 2012).  However, 
the Supreme Court has held that no recovery is available for discrete acts 
such  as  hiring,  firing,  and  promotions  that  fall  outside  the  filing  period, 
even  if  they  are  arguably  related  to  other  discriminatory  acts  that  occur 
within  the  filing  period.    National  Railroad  Passenger  Corp.  v.  Morgan, 
536  U.S.  101  (2002).    See  also  EEOC  Compliance  Manual  915.003, 
Section 2: “Threshold Issues,”(rev. July 21, 2005).  However, as the Court 
recognized,  an  employee  may  use  the  prior  discrete  acts  as  background 
evidence in support of a timely harassment claim. 

Practice  Tip:    It  is  critical  that  agencies  document  their  actions  and  the 
reasons  for  those  actions  in  the  record  for  Administrative  Judge  and 
Commission  consideration  later  in  the  process.    For  example,  if  the 
agency’s investigator  decides  that  a  certain  factual incident raised  by the 
complainant  is  of  little  relevance  to  his/her  claim  and,  therefore,  decides 
that  an  investigation  of  that  incident  is  very  minimal,  the  investigator 

Management Directive 
5-9 

 
 
 
 
should  document  that  decision  and  the  reasons  for  it  in  the  investigative 
report. 

B. 

A Complainant May Amend a Pending Complaint 

At  any  time  prior  to  the  agency’s  mailing  of  the  notice  required  by  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(f)  at  the  conclusion  of  the  investigation,  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.106(d) 
permits a complainant to amend a pending EEO complaint to add claims that are 
like  or  related  to  those  claim(s)  raised  in  the  pending  complaint.3
    There  is  no 
requirement  that  the  complainant  seek  counseling  on  these  new  claims.    See 
, EEOC Appeal No. 0120102410 (Oct. 29, 2010).  
Braxton v. U.S. Postal Service
After  the  complainant  has  requested  a  hearing,  s/he  may  file  a  motion  with  the 
Administrative  Judge  to  amend  the  complaint  to  include  claims  that  are  like  or 
related to those raised in the pending complaint. 

This  situation  most  frequently  occurs  when  an  alleged  discriminatory  incident 
occurs after the  filing  of  an EEO  complaint.   In  the past,  agencies usually  made 
these  subsequent  incidents  the  basis  of  a  separate  EEO  complaint.    A  separate 
EEO complaint is not appropriate, however, if the new incident of discrimination 
raises a claim that is like or related to the original complaint.  Rather, the original 
complaint should be amended to include the new incident of discrimination. 

When  a  complainant  raises  a  new  incident  of  alleged  discrimination  during  the 
processing  of  an  EEO  complaint,  it  must  be  determined  whether  this  new 
incident: 

provides additional evidence offered to support the existing claim, 

1. 
but does not raise a new claim in and of itself; 

raises a new claim that is like or related to the claim(s) raised in the 

2. 
pending complaint; or  

3. 

raises a new claim that is not like or related to the claim(s) raised 
in the pending complaint.  

In order to facilitate such a determination, the complainant shall be instructed by 
the investigator (or any other EEO staff person with whom complainant raises the 
new  incident)  to  submit  a  letter  to  the  agency’s  EEO  Director  or  a  designee 
describing  the  new  incident(s)  and  stating  that  s/he  wishes  to  amend  his/her 
complaint  to  include  the  new  incident(s).    The  EEO  Director  or  designee  shall 

3 Note that technical amendments to a complaint, such as changing the name of the agency head, 

should be handled quickly and without adding additional case processing time.

review  this  request,  determine  whether  a  fair  and  impartial  investigation  of  the 
new claims can be accomplished within 360 days of the original filed complaint, 
and determine the correct handling of the amendment in an expeditious manner. 

1. 

New Incident That Is Part of the Existing Claim 

If  the  EEO  Director  or  designee  concludes  that  the  new  incident(s) 
provides additional evidence offered in support of the claim raised in the 
pending complaint, but does not raise a new claim in and of itself, then the 
EEO  Director  or  designee  should  instruct  the  investigator  to  include  the 
new incident in the investigation.  A copy of this letter should be sent to 
the  complainant  unless  they  have  provided  notice  that  they  have  a 
representative.    In  such  a  case,  the  acknowledgment  and  all  subsequent 
actions  on  the  complaint  should  be  mailed  or  delivered  to  complainant’s 
representative with a copy to the complainant, unless the complainant has 
stated otherwise. 

Example 4 

During  EEO  counseling  and  in  her  formal  complaint,  an  agency 
employee  has  alleged  that  her  co-workers  were  harassing  her 
because of her gender, and she cites five examples of harassment.  
During the investigation, she provides an initial affidavit detailing 
these  incidents.    Shortly  thereafter,  the  employee  contacts  the 
investigator and tells him of several new incidents of gender-based 
harassment  by  these  same  co-workers.    In  this  case,  these  new 
incidents are additional evidence offered by complainant in support 
of  her  pending  claim  of  discriminatory  harassment,  and  the 
investigator  should  be  instructed  to  incorporate  these  new  facts 
into  his  investigation  of  the  pending  claim.    In  this  instance,  the 
investigative period is not extended beyond 180 days, except with 
the  consent  of 
to  29  C.F.R. 
the  complainant  pursuant 
§ 1614.108(e).

2. 

New  Incident  That  Raises  a  New  Claim  Like  or  Related  to  the 
Pending Claim 

While a complaint is pending, a complainant may raise a new incident of 
alleged  discrimination  that  is  not  part  of  the  existing  claim,  but  may  be 
part of a new claim that is like or related to the pending claim.  In deciding 
if  a  subsequent  claim  is  “like  or  related”  to  the  original  claim,  a 
determination  must  be  made  as  to  whether  the  later  incident  adds  to  or 
clarifies the original claim, and/or could have reasonably been expected to 
grow  out  of  the  investigation  of  the  original  claim.    See  Complainant  v. 
Dep’t. of the Army, EEOC Appeal No. 0120142480 (Nov. 25, 2014; Scher 
v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No.  05940702  (May  30,  1995); 
Webber  v.  Dep’t.  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01900902 (Feb. 28, 1990). 

In  accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.108(f)  and  guidance  set  forth  in 
Section  II(A)(1)  of  this  Chapter,  if  the  EEO  Director  or  designee 
concludes  that  the  new  incident(s)  raises  a  new  claim,  but  that  this  new 
claim is like or related to the claim(s) raised in the pending complaint, the 
agency  must  amend  the  pending  complaint  to  include  the  new  claim.   
Accordingly,  and  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.106(e),  the  agency  shall 
acknowledge  receipt  of  an  amendment  to  a  complaint  in  writing  and 
inform  the  complainant  of  the  date  on  which  the  amendment  was  filed.  
The EEO Director or designee should also send a copy of the letter to the 
EEO  Investigator  who  is  investigating  the  complainant’s  prior  complaint 
with instructions to include the new incident(s) in the investigation. 

Example 5 

An agency employee files a race discrimination complaint alleging 
he  was  not  selected  for  a  particular  supervisory  position,  despite 
his  belief  that  he  was  the  best  qualified  candidate  for  the  job.   
During  the  investigation  into  his  complaint,  the  same  selecting 
official  does  not  select  the  complainant  for  another  supervisory 
position.  Complainant again asserts he was not selected because of 
his  race.    This  new  claim  of  a  discriminatory  non-selection  is 
sufficiently  like  or related to  the  original non-selection claim that 
the  agency  should  amend  the  original  complaint  to  include  the 
subsequent non-selection. 

Management Directive 
5-12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 6 

During  the  investigation  into  her  claim  that  the  agency  is 
discriminating  against  her  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  her 
employment  because  her  supervisor  denied  her  developmental 
assignments that could lead to upward mobility in the agency, the 
complainant informs the investigator that her supervisor just issued 
her a letter of warning for attendance problems.  The complainant 
asserts  that  the  supervisor  took  this  action  in  retaliation  for  her 
complaint about the denial of development assignments.  This new 
claim of retaliation is related to the pending claim because it grew 
out of the investigation into that claim.  The agency should amend 
the  original  complaint  to  include  this  subsequent,  but  related, 
claim. 

Example 7 

An agency employee files a complaint of discrimination when his 
request for a hardship transfer is denied.  During the investigation 
into his complaint, the complainant sends a letter to the EEO office 
stating that he has decided to resign from the agency because of the 
agency’s failure to transfer him and the resulting stress.  He further 
states  that  he  is  no  longer seeking the transfer  as a remedy to  his 
complaint,  but  asserts  he  is  entitled  to  a  compensatory  damages 
award  instead.    The  EEO  office  should  amend  the  original 
complaint to include the complainant’s new like or related claim of 
constructive discharge. 

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.106(e)(2), the agency is required to complete 
its  investigation  of  an  EEO  complaint  within  180  days  of  the  filing  of  a 
complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the time period.  If 
a  complaint  is  amended,  however,  this  deadline  is  adjusted  so  that  the 
agency must complete its investigation within the earlier of 180 days after 
the last amendment to the complaint or not more than 360 days after the 
filing of the original complaint.  

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(g) the agency is still required to issue a 
notice to complainant that the investigation is not complete and estimating 
a  time  in  which  it  will  be  complete.    A  complainant  retains  the  right  to 
request  a  hearing,  even  in  the  case  of  an  amended  complaint,  after  180 
days  have  passed  since  the  filing  of  the  original  complaint,  even  if  the 
agency’s  investigation  has  not  been  completed.    In  such  a  case,  an 
Administrative  Judge  may  develop  the  record  through  discovery  and  the 

Management Directive 
5-13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hearing process, or utilize other means within his/her discretion to ensure 
that the amended complaint is properly addressed. 

3. 

New  Incident  Raises  Claim  That  Is  Not  Like  or  Related  to  Pending 
Claim 

In cases where subsequent acts of alleged discrimination do not add to or 
clarify the original claim, and/or could not have been reasonably expected 
to  grow  out  of  the  investigation  of  the  original  claim,  the  later  incident 
should  be  the  subject  of  a  separate  EEO  complaint.    In  such  cases, 
fragmented processing of an EEO complaint is not at issue because there 
are two distinct and unrelated legal claims being alleged. 

If the EEO Director or designee concludes that the new claim raised by the 
complainant  is  not  like  or  related  to  the  claim(s)  raised  in  the  pending 
complaint,  then  the  complainant  must  be  advised  in  writing  that  s/he 
should seek EEO counseling on the new claim.  The postmark date of the 
letter (from complainant requesting an amendment) to the EEO Director or 
designee  would  be  the  date  for  time  computation  purposes  used  to 
determine  if  initial  counselor  contact  was  timely  under  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105(b). 

Example 8 

An  agency  employee  sought  EEO  counseling  and  filed  a  formal 
complaint  concerning his  allegation that the agency  discriminated 
against  him  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  his  employment  by 
requiring  that  he  adhere  to  a  specific  work  schedule  while  not 
imposing  a  similar  requirement  on  a  comparative  employee.   
During the investigation into this complaint, the complainant tells 
the investigator that he was recently not selected for a position in 
another  facility  and  believes  this  occurred  as  a  result  of 
discrimination.  In this case, the discriminatory non-selection claim 
is not like or related to the adherence to the work schedule claim, 
as it is factually distinct and cannot reasonably be said to add to or 
clarify the original claim. 

C. 

Consolidation of Complaints 

As  noted  above,  a  new  claim  that  is  not  like  or  related  to  a  previously  filed 
complaint provides the basis for a new, and separate, complaint.  The complainant 
must present the new, unrelated claim to an EEO Counselor and the new claim is 
subject to all of the regulatory case processing requirements.  In order to address a 

Management Directive 
5-14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different  fragmentation  concern,  29 C.F.R.  §  1614.606  requires  agencies  to 
consolidate for joint processing two or more complaints of discrimination filed by 
the  same  complainant,  after  appropriate  notification  is  provided  to  the  parties.4
While  it  is  anticipated  that  most  consolidated  complaints  will  be  investigated 
together,  in  certain  circumstances,  such  as  significant  geographic  distance 
between  the  sites  of  two  complaints,  consolidation  does  not  preclude  an  agency 
from investigating each complaint separately.  In all instances, however, where an 
individual  requests  a  hearing,  the  consolidated  complaints  should  be  heard  by  a 
single  Administrative  Judge;  or  where  the  complainant  requests  a  final  agency 
decision, the agency should issue a single decision.  An agency must consolidate 
complaints  filed  by  the  same  complainant  before  the  agency  issues  the  notice 
required by 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(f) at the conclusion of the investigation. 

When  a  complaint  has  been  consolidated  with  an  earlier  filed  complaint,  the 
agency  must  complete  its  investigation  within  the  earlier  of  180  days  after  the 
filing of the last complaint or not later than 360 days after the filing of the original 
complaint.    See  Section  II.A.1  of  this  Chapter  for  more  information  on  time 
limits.    A  complainant  has  the  right  to  request  a  hearing,  even  in  the  case  of 
consolidated  complaints,  after  180  days  have  passed  since  the  filing  of  the 
original  complaint,  even  if  the  agency’s  investigation  is  not  complete.    If  not 
already  consolidated,  an  Administrative  Judge  or  the  Commission  in  their 
discretion may consolidate two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the 
same complainant. 

Section 1614.606 of 29 C.F.R. permits, but does not require, the consolidation of 
complaints  filed  by  different  complainants  that  consist  of  substantially  similar 
allegations or allegations related to the same matter. 

D. 

Partial Dismissals 

Another  method  of  addressing  the  fragmentation  problem  is  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(b), which provides for no immediate right to appeal a partial dismissal 
of a complaint.  See Section IV.C of this Chapter for a more detailed discussion of 
partial  dismissals.    Partial  dismissals  will  be  preserved  and  decided  within  the 
context of the rest of the complaint. 

4 Through mandatory consolidation, the Commission seeks to address the situation where a single 
complainant  has  multiple  complaints  pending  against an  agency.    Even  if  the  complaints are  unrelated, 
their resolution in a single proceeding may make better use of agency and Commission resources.

No Remands by Administrative Judges 

To further avoid the fragmenting of EEO claims, Administrative Judges will not 
remand  issues  to  agencies  for  counseling  or  other  processing.    Once  a  case  is 
before an Administrative Judge, that Administrative Judge is fully responsible for 
processing  it.    Chapter  7,  “Hearings,”  in  this  Management  Directive  discusses 
more fully this provision. 

F. 

“Spin-off” Complaints 

Section  1614.107(a)(8)  of  29  C.F.R.  provides  for  the  dismissal  of  spin-off 
complaints,  which  are  complaints  about  the  processing  of  existing  complaints.   
Complaints about the processing of existing complaints should be referred to the 
agency official responsible for complaint processing, and/or processed as part of 
the original complaint, as set forth in Section IV.D of this Chapter. 

G. 

Training 

As already emphasized, the EEO Counselor and investigator have critical roles in 
identifying,  defining,  and  clarifying  an  aggrieved  employee’s  legal  claims.   
Therefore,  agencies  must  provide  all  agency  EEO  Counselors  and  investigators 
with  mandatory  training  in  this  area  as  well  as  ensure  that  all  contract  EEO 
Counselors and investigators have received training in this area.  See Chapter 2, 
Section  II  (EEO  Counselor  training)  and  Chapter  6,  Section  II  (investigator 
training) of this Management Directive. 

IV.   AGENCY DISMISSAL PROCESS 

Circumstances under which an agency may dismiss a complaint are set forth in 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a).  An agency’s authority to dismiss a complaint ends when a complainant 
requests  a  hearing.    An  agency  should  process  dismissals  expeditiously.    To  avoid 
common errors in dismissing complaints of discrimination see EEOC, Preserving Access 
to the Legal System: Common Errors by Federal Agencies in Dismissing Complaints of 
the 
Discrimination  on  Procedural  Grounds, 
Commission’s website. 

in  September  of  2014  on 

issued 

The  agency  should  clearly  set  forth  its  reasoning  for  dismissing  the  complaint  in  all 
dismissal  decisions  and  include  evidence  in  the  record  that  supports  the  grounds  for 
dismissal. 
the  agency  dismisses  a  claim  under  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a)(3)  because  a  civil  action  was  filed  by  complainant,  the  agency  should 
ensure that a copy of the civil complaint is included in the record.

A claim that was not brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor 
in a timely manner. 

The complainant did not contact an EEO Counselor within forty-
five (45) days of the discriminatory event or within 45 days of the 
effective date of the personnel action, 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1), 
and  the  complainant  did  not  show  that  the  45-day  contact  period 
should  be  extended  pursuant  to  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.105(a)(2).    See, 
for  example,  Ball  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No. 
05880247  (July  6,  1988)  (reasonable  suspicion  standard  used  to

the  agency  could  not  establish  that  the  complainant  was 
notified  of  the  time  limits  and  was  otherwise  aware  of

the discriminatory practice or personnel action occurred or 
that despite due diligence was prevented by circumstances 
beyond his/her control from contacting an EEO Counselor 
within  the  time  limits,  or  for  other  reasons  considered 
sufficient by the agency or the Commission; or 

the  complainant  contends  that  the  claim  is  a  part  of  a 
pattern of discrimination or establishes that there are other 
equitable  circumstances  that  mitigate  untimely  contact.   
Time  limits  are  subject  to  waiver,  estoppel,  and  equitable 
tolling under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.604(c).

Untimely Filing of the Formal Complaint – 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a) (2) 

The complainant failed to file a formal complaint within fifteen (15) days 
of his/her receipt of the EEO Counselor’s Notice of Right to File a Formal 
Complaint    in  an  individual  complaint,  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.105(d),  or  in  a 
class complaint,  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(c).   The  agency  has the burden of 
proving that the complainant received the notice and that the notice clearly 
informed  the  aggrieved  person  of  the  15-day  filing  time  frame.    See,  for 
example,  Paoletti  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No.  05950259 
(Aug. 17, 1995).  This time  limit is also subject  to waiver,  estoppel, and 
equitable tolling under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.604(c). 

3. 

Failure to State a Claim - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(1) 

The complainant failed to state a claim under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.103.  This 
may  include  a  claim  that  does  not  allege  discrimination  on  a  basis 
encompassed in one of the statutes applicable to federal sector employees.  
In  determining  whether  a  complaint  states  a  claim,  the  proper  inquiry  is 
whether  the  conduct  if  true  would  constitute  an  unlawful  employment 
practice  under  the EEO  statutes.   Cobb v. Dep’t. of  the Treasury,  EEOC 
Request  No.  05970077  (Mar.  13,  1997)  (a  complaint  should  not  be 
dismissed  for failure  to state a  claim unless  it  appears beyond  doubt that 
the complainant cannot prove a set of facts in support of the claim which 
would entitle the complainant to relief; the trier of fact must consider all of 
the  alleged  harassing  incidents  and  remarks  and,  considering  them 
together in the light most favorable to the complainant, determine whether 
they are sufficient to state a claim).  See also Burlington Industries, Inc. v. 
Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 752-753 (1998) (referencing cases in which courts 
of appeals considered whether various employment actions were sufficient 
to state a claim under the civil rights laws).  Dismissal for failure to state a 
claim also may be appropriate where the complainant named the improper 
agency.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.106(a).  

An  agency  shall  accept  a  complaint  from  any  aggrieved  employee  or 
applicant  for  employment  who  believes  that  s/he  was  discriminated 
against by that agency because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, 
age,  disabling  condition,  genetic  information,  or  retaliation. 
  The 
Commission  has  long  defined  an  “aggrieved  employee”  as  one  who 
suffers  a  present  harm  or  loss  with  respect  to  a  term,  condition,  or 
privilege  of  employment  for  which  there  is  a  remedy.    Diaz  v.  Dep’t.  of 
the  Air  Force,  EEOC  Request  No.  05931049  (Apr.  21,  1994);  see  also 
Wildberger  v.  Small  Business  Administration,  EEOC  Request  No. 
05960761  (Oct.  8,  1998).    An  agency  is  required  to  address  EEO 
complaints  only  when  filed  by  an  individual  who  has  suffered  direct, 

Management Directive 
5-18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
personal deprivation at the hands of the employer; the agency’s act must 
have caused some concrete effect on the aggrieved person’s employment 
status.    Quinones  v.  Dep’t.  of  Defense,  EEOC  Request  No.  05920051 
(Mar. 12, 1992).   

Further,  it  is  inappropriate  for  an  individual  to  use  the  EEO  process  to 
lodge  a  collateral  attack  against  another  proceeding.    For  example,  see 
Schneider v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Request No. 05A01065 (Aug. 16, 
2002)(affirming  agency  dismissal  of  complaint  alleging  discriminatory 
delay  in  submission  of  worker’s  compensation  claim  as  collateral  attack 
on  OWCP  claim  process);  Jones  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Army,  EEOC  Request 
No. 05A00428 (Mar. 1, 2002) (affirming dismissal of complaint regarding 
polygraph  examination  as  a  collateral  attack  on  the  agency’s  internal 
investigation  of  disappearance  of  agency  property);  or  Lingad  v.  U.S. 
Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No.  05930106  (June  25,  1993)  (holding 
that  discriminatory  actions  taken  to  influence  the  outcome  of  decision 
rendered under the negotiated grievance procedure is outside the purview 
of EEO process).  The proper forum to raise these kinds of issues is within 
the process itself.  An agency should dismiss these complaints as failures 
to state a claim. 

When an individual alleges retaliation in a complaint, they do not need to 
make  a  showing  of  an  adverse  employment  action.    See  Burlington 
Northern  &  Santa  Fe  Railway  Co.  v.  White,  548  U.S.  53,  68  (2006); 
EEOC Compliance Manual 915.003 Section 8-Retaliation II.D.3 (May 20, 
1998) (any adverse treatment that is based upon a retaliatory motive and is 
reasonably  likely  to  deter  the  charging  party  or  others  from  engaging  in 
protected  activity  states  a  claim).    The  significance  of  the  act  of  alleged 
retaliation  will  often  depend  upon  the  particular  circumstances.    For 
example, in  Isom v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0120113627 
(Nov.  7,  2012),  the  complainant  alleged  that  he  was  required  to  perform 
both forklift and jitney duties.  The record revealed that other employees 
were  required  to  perform  either  forklift  or  jitney  duties  but  not  both  and 
that the supervisor involved was under pressure to discipline complainant 
for refusing an assignment even if the discipline was not warranted.  The 
Commission found a viable claim of retaliation was stated and remanded 
the case to the agency to process.

Abuse of Process - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(9) 

Section  1614.107(a)(9)  of  29  C.F.R.  is  the  appropriate  provision  under 
which an agency may dismiss a complaint on the extraordinary grounds of 
abuse of process.   

a. 

b. 

Abuse  of  process  is  defined  as  a  clear  pattern  of  misuse  of  the 
process  for  ends  other  than  that  which  it  was  designed  to 
accomplish.  See Buren v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Request No. 
05850299  (Nov.  18,  1985);  Kleinman  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service, 
EEOC  Appeal  No.  01943637  (September  22,  1994);  Sessoms  v. 
U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01973440 (June 11, 1998).  
The  Commission  has  a  strong  policy  in  favor  of  preserving  a 
complainant’s  EEO  rights  whenever  possible.    The  occasions  in 
which  application  of  the  standards  are  appropriate  must  be  rare, 
because of the strong policy in favor of preserving a complainant's 
EEO  rights  whenever  possible.    See  generally  Love  v.  Pullman, 
404  U.S.  522  (1972);  Wrenn  v.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity 
Commission,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01932105  (Aug.  19,  1993).  
Therefore, such dismissals must be taken only in cases where there 
is a clear misuse or abuse of the administrative process.   

In  order  to  determine  whether  a  complaint,  or  a  number  of 
consolidated complaints, should be dismissed for this reason under 
29  C.F.R.  § 1614.107(a)(9),  the  agency  or  Administrative  Judge 
must  strictly  apply  the  criteria  established  by  the  Commission  on 
this issue.5
  This  requires an  analysis of whether  the  complainant 
evidences an ulterior purpose to abuse or misuse the EEO process.  
Agencies  are  cautioned  that  numerous  complaint  filings  alone  is 
not a sufficient basis for determining that there has been an abuse 
of the process.  However, multiple filings on the same issues, lack 
of  specificity  in  the  allegations,  and  the  filing  of  complaints  on 
allegations  previously  raised,  may  be  considered  in  deciding 
whether  a  complainant  has  engaged  in  a  pattern  of  abuse  of  the 
EEO  process.   All pending complaints  from a  complainant  which 
satisfy  these  criteria  should  be  consolidated  for  dismissal  under 
this section. 

c. 

Cases  in  which  the  Commission  has  found  an  abuse  of  the  EEO 
process  include  those  where,  upon  review  of  the  complainant’s

Commission  has  concluded  that  the  complainant  has  pursued  a 
scheme  involving  the  misuse  and  misapplication  of  the  EEO 
process  for  an  end  other  than  that  which  it  was  designed  to 
accomplish.

in 

reviewing  a  complainant’s  prior 
For  example, 
complaints,  the  Commission  has  found  abuse  of  process 
where  the  complainant  presented  similar  or  identical 
allegations, evidencing a pattern of initiating the complaint 
process whenever the agency did anything that dissatisfied 
the  complainant.    Hooks  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC 
Appeal No. 01953852 (Nov. 28, 1995).   

The Commission has also found abuse of process when the 
complainant  presented  similar  or  identical  allegations 
related  to  the  complainant’s  dissatisfaction  with  the  EEO 
process  itself.    Goatcher  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC 
Request  No.  05950557  (Oct.  18,  1996).    The  complainant 
in  Goatcher  filed  numerous  complaints  concerning  the 
agency’s purported denial of access to sufficient equipment 
and storage for EEO claims, denial of official time for such 
claims,  inadequate  EEO  counseling,  agency  monitoring  of 
time spent in the EEO process, and failure to maintain her 
anonymity during EEO counseling.   

In  Sessoms  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01973440 (June 11, 1998),  the Commission noted  that the 
appellant was experienced in the EEO process, but that he 
pursued  a  clear  pattern  of  abuse  of  the  EEO  process  by 
filing  numerous  frivolous  complaints.    The  Commission 
noted,  “A  definite  pattern  of  initiating  the  complaint 
machinery with respect to any matter with which appellant 
was dissatisfied has developed . . . clearly has amounted to 
an  abuse  of  process.”    See  also  Kessinger  v.  U.S.  Postal 
Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999) (clear 
pattern  of  abuse  from  multiple  filings,  totaling  over  160 
complaints and 150 appeals, many of which were duplicate 
complaints  of  earlier,  dismissed  filings;  the  Commission 
found the complainant’s actions an intentional effort to clog 
the agency’s in-house administrative machinery); Stoyanov 
v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  EEOC  Appeal  Nos.  0120113142, 
0120113817, and 0120114019 (Dec. 6, 2011) (clear pattern 
of  abuse  from  multiple  filings  many  of  which  concerned

5-21 

 
 
 
 
 
selections  for  positions  for  which  complainant  was  not 
eligible to apply). 

d. 

The Commission has stressed in such cases that a party cannot be 
permitted  to  utilize  the  EEO  process  to  circumvent  other 
administrative  processes;  nor  can  individuals  be  permitted  to 
overburden  the  EEO  system,  which  is  designed  to  protect 
individuals from discriminatory practices.

Subsequently,  he  repeatedly  filed  complaints  of  reprisal, 
alleging  that  the  agency  was  denying  him  official  time  to 
prepare EEO  complaints, denying him the use of facilities 
and  storage  space  for  his  EEO  materials,  providing 
improper EEO counseling, and unfairly keeping tabs on the 
amount  of  official  time  he  was  spending  on  his  EEO 
complaints.    Many  of  the  allegations  in  these  complaints 
were  vague,  and  raised  allegations  previously  raised  in 
earlier  complaints.    In  fact,  he  had  on  several  occasions 
copied  a  previous  complaint  on  which  he  would  write  a 
new date in order to file new complaint.  Over the course of 
several  months,  he  filed  a  total  of  25  complaints  in  this 
manner.    The  agency  could  consolidate  the  subsequent 
complaints 
29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a)  for  abuse  of  process.    The  complainant  had 
demonstrated  a  pattern  of  abuse  of  the  process,  involving 
multiple  complaints  containing 
identical  or  similar 
allegations.    (See,  for  example,  Kessinger  v.  U.S.  Postal 
Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01976399 (June 8, 1999); Story

alleging  specific  and  distinct  acts  of  reprisal  for  her  prior 
EEO  activity.    Based  on  the  number  of  complaints  alone, 
the  agency  attempted  to  dismiss  them  all  for  abuse  of 
process.

Management Directive 
5-22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  was  insufficient  evidence  to  dismiss  the  complaints 
for  abuse  of  process.    Evidence  of  numerous  complaint 
filings,  in  and  of  itself,  is  not  a  sufficient  basis  for  deter-
mining that there has been an abuse of the process.  In this 
case, there was no evidence that the complainant’s ulterior 
purpose  was  to  abuse  the  EEO  process,  or  that  she  was 
misusing the process for ends other than that which it was 
designed  to  accomplish.    It  may  be  appropriate,  however, 
for the agency to consolidate the individual complaints for 
processing. (See, for example, Manley v. Dep’t. of the Air 
Force,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01975901  (May  29,  1998);  and 
Donnelly v. Dep’t. of Energy, EEOC Appeal No. 01972171 
(Nov. 17, 1997) for decisions rejecting agency contentions 
of abuse of process.)

States the Same Claim - 29 C.F.R. §1614.107(a)(1) 

The  complaint  states  the  same  claim  that  is  pending  before  or  had  been 
decided by the agency or Commission except in those cases where a class 
action  complaint  is  pending.6
    The  Commission  has  interpreted  this 
regulation  to  require  that  the  complaint  must  set  forth  the  “identical 
matters” raised in a previous complaint filed by the same complainant, in 
Terhune v. U.S. Postal 
order for the subsequent complaint to be rejected.

Complainant Files a Civil Action - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(3) 

The  complainant  files  a  civil  action  concerning  the  same  allegation,  at 
least one hundred eighty (180) days after s/he filed his/her administrative 
complaint.  The requirement in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.409 that the civil action 
shall  be  dismissed  only  if  it  was  filed  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.408 
evidences the intent of the Commission to restrict the dismissals of EEO 
complaints  for  filing  a  civil  action  to  those  civil  actions  which  were 
brought  under  the  statutes  enforced  by  the  Commission.    Where  a 
complainant  has  not  filed  a  civil  action  pursuant  to  the  specific  statutes 
listed  in  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.408,  the  complaint  may  not  be  dismissed

from 

The same issue has been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and 
the  complainant  was  a  party  to  the  lawsuit.    Commission  regulations 
mandate dismissal of the EEO complaint under these circumstances so as 
to  prevent  a  complainant 
simultaneously  pursuing  both 
administrative  and  judicial  remedies  on  the  same  matters,  wasting 
resources,  and  creating  the  potential  for  inconsistent  or  conflicting 
decisions.    Stromgren  v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans  Affairs,  EEOC  Request  No. 
05891079  (May  7,  1990);  Sandy  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01893513  (Oct.  19,  1989).    The  proper  inquiry  to  determine  whether 
dismissal is warranted is whether the issues in the EEO complaint and the 
civil action are the same, that is, whether the acts of alleged discrimination 
are  identical.    Bellow  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No. 
05890913  (Nov.  27,  1989).    The  factual  allegations  and  not  the  bases  or 
the precise relief requested should be the crux of the legal analysis.

Allegation  Raised  in  Negotiated  Grievance  Proceeding  -  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a)(4) 

The  complainant  has  raised  the  allegation  in  a  negotiated  grievance 
procedure that permits allegations of discrimination, indicating an election 
to pursue a non-EEO process.  Section 1614.301(a) of 29 C.F.R. provides 
that  “a  person  wishing  to  file  a  complaint  or  a  grievance  on  a  matter  of 
alleged  employment  discrimination  must  elect  to  raise  the  matter  under 
either part 1614 or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.”  This 
subsection  also  provides  that  an  election  to  proceed  under  1614  is 
indicated  by  the  “filing  of  a  written  complaint,”  while  an  election  to 
proceed under a negotiated grievance procedure is indicated by the “filing 
of a timely written  grievance.”  See Casey v. Dep’t. of Veterans Affairs, 
EEOC  Appeal  No.  01944605  (Aug.  9,  1995).7

because  the  union  exercised  its  right  to  file  its  own  grievance  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  a  Collective 
Bargaining Agreement.  See 
Callahan v. Dep’t. of the Interior, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110309 (Jan. 5, 
2012)  (complainant  stated  that  the  union  filed  a  grievance  without  his  knowledge  and  there  was  no 
evidence in the record that complainant was involved in filing the grievance); see also Cate v. Dep’t. of 
the Army, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110083 (Nov. 21, 2011).

Appeal Made to MSPB - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(4) 

The  complainant  has  elected  to  appeal  the  claim  to  the  Merit  Systems 
Protection Board, rather than file a mixed case complaint under 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.302.  

10. 

Complaint Alleges a Preliminary Step - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(5) 

The  complaint  alleges  that  a  proposal  to  take  or  a  preliminary  step  in 
taking  a  personnel  action  is  discriminatory.    This  provision  requires  the 
dismissal  of  complaints  that  allege  discrimination  “in  any  preliminary 
steps  that  do  not,  without  further  action,  affect  the  person:  for  example, 
progress reviews or improvement periods that are not a part of any official 
file  on  the  employee.”    57  Fed.  Reg.  12,643  (Apr.  10,  1992);  see,  for 
example,  McAlhaney  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Request  No. 
05940949  (July  7,  1995).    However,  if  the  complaint  alleges  that  a 
proposal  to  take  or  a  preliminary  step  in  taking  a  personnel  action  is 
retaliatory,  the  complaint  should  not  be  dismissed  because  a  proposed 
action could be considered adverse treatment in the context of reprisal if it 
is  reasonably  likely  to  deter  protected  activity.8
Brown  v.  Dep’t.  of 
Defense
,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120103139  (Dec.  8,  2010)  (complainant’s 
claim that the agency discriminated against him when it placed him on a 
performance  improvement  plan  stated  a  viable  claim  of  retaliation).    In 
addition,  if  the  individual  alleges  that  the  preliminary  step  was  part  of  a 
pattern of harassing the  individual for a  prohibited reason,  the complaint 
cannot  be  dismissed  under  this  section  because  the  preliminary  step  has 
already  affected  the  employee.    See,  for  example,  Noone  v.  Central 
Intelligence  Agency,  EEOC  Request  No.  05940422  (Jan.  23,  1995);  see 
also Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111470 (Jan.

Complaint is Moot - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(5) 

A  complaint  may  be  dismissed  as  moot  where  there  is  no  reasonable 
expectation  that  the  alleged  violation  will  recur,  and  interim  relief  or 

8 Dismissal of allegedly retaliatory proposals and other preliminary steps may be appropriate under 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(1) if the alleged retaliatory actions are not “materially adverse,” that is, would 
not dissuade a reasonable employee in complainant’s circumstances from engaging in protected activity.

events  have  completely  and  irrevocably  eradicated  the  effects  of  the 
alleged  violation.    See  Wildberger  v.  Small  Business  Administration, 
EEOC  Request  No.  05960761  (Oct.  8,  1998),  (citing  County  of  Los 
Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625 (1979)).  When such circumstances exist, 
no relief is available, and there is no need for a determination of the rights 
of  the  parties.    The  Commission  has  also  held,  however,  that  where  a 
complainant  has  made  a  timely  request  for  compensatory  damages,  an 
agency  must  address  the  issue  of  compensatory  damages  before  it  can 
dismiss a complaint for mootness.  See, for example, Salazar v. Dep’t. of 
Justice, EEOC Request No. 05930316 (Feb. 9, 1994).9

12.   Dissatisfaction  with  the  Processing  of  a  Complaint  -  29  C.F.R. 

§ 1614.107(a)(8) 

The  complaint alleges dissatisfaction with  the  processing  of  a previously 
filed  complaint.    See  discussion  in  Section  IV.D  of  this  Chapter  of  the 
Management Directive. 

Dismissals that Generally Occur after the Agency Accepts the Complaint Based on 

B. 
Complainant’s Actions or Inactions 

1. 

The Complainant Cannot Be Located - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(6)  

The regulations permit dismissal where the complainant cannot be located.  
The  provision  requires  that  the  agency  make  reasonable  efforts  to  locate 
the complainant and inform the complainant that s/he must respond to the 
agency’s  notice  of  proposed  dismissal  within  fifteen  (15)  days  sent  to 
his/her  last  known address.  A matter  may  not  be “dismissed” under this 
section until after the complaint has been filed.  See Clairborne v. Dep’t. 
of the Air Force, EEOC Appeal No. 01972713 (Mar. 19, 1998). 

2. 

The Complainant Failed to Respond or Proceed in a Timely Fashion - 
29 C.F.R. §  1614.107(a)(7) 

9  A  different  situation  is  presented  where  an  agency  unilaterally  and  unconditionally  promises  in 
writing to provide the full and complete remedy as defined by the Administrative Judge.  Although the 
complaint  is  Amoot@  in  the  sense  that  the  guarantee  of  complete  relief  completely  and  irrevocably 
eradicates the effects of the alleged violation, the Administrative Judge will not dismiss the complaint as 
moot, but will issue an order determining the appropriate remedy.  The purpose of this requirement is to 
ensure that the complainant will be able to seek enforcement of the agency’s agreement to provide full 
relief should the agency fail to do so.  See Chapter 7, Section III.D.15 of this Management Directive. 

Management Directive 
5-26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
The  regulations  permit  dismissal  where  the  complainant  has  failed  to 
respond  to  a  written  “request  to  provide  relevant  information  or  to 
otherwise  proceed”  within  15  days  of  receipt,  provided  that  the  request 
contained notice of the proposed dismissal and further provided that there 
is  otherwise  insufficient  available  information  to  adjudicate  the  claim.  
The regulation further states that an agency may not dismiss on this basis 
where the record includes sufficient information to issue a decision.  See 
Delancy v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0120111686 (Mar. 13, 
2012).    The  Commission  also  has  held  that  the  regulation  is  applicable 
only  in  cases  where  there  is  a  clear  record  of  delay  or  contumacious 
conduct by the complainant.  See Martinez v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC 
Appeal No. 0120113028 (Nov. 2, 2011) (dismissal of complaint for failure 
to  cooperate  was  improper  where  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to 
support  a  conclusion  that  complainant  purposely  engaged  in  delay  or 
contumacious conduct, and there was sufficient information in the record 
to  have  permitted  the  agency  to  continue  the  investigation,  including 
extensive  information  as  to  the  alleged  discriminatory  action  and  the 
responsible officials). 

C. 

Processing of Partially Dismissed Complaints 

There is no immediate right to appeal a partial dismissal of a complaint.  Where 
an agency believes  that  some  but  not  all of the  claims in a complaint should be 
dismissed for the reasons contained in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a), the agency must 
notify  the  complainant  in  writing  of  its  determination,  set  forth  its  rationale  for 
that  determination,  and  notify  the  complainant  that  the  allegations  will  not  be 
investigated.  The agency must place a copy of the notice in the investigative file.  
The  agency  should  advise  the  complainant  that  an  Administrative  Judge  shall 
review its dismissal determination if s/he requests a hearing on the remainder of 
the  complaint,  but  the  complainant  may  not  appeal  the  dismissal  until  a  final 
action is taken by the agency on the remainder of the complaint.  See 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(b).  

1. 

Where a Hearing Is Requested 

If  the  complainant  requests  a  hearing  from  an  Administrative  Judge,  the 
Administrative Judge will evaluate the agency’s reasons for believing that 
a portion of the complaint met the standards for dismissal before holding 
the  hearing.    If  the  Administrative  Judge  believes  that  all  or  part  of  the 
agency’s  reasons  are  not  well  taken,  the  entire  complaint  or  all  of  the 
portions  not  meeting  the  standards  for  dismissal  will  continue  in  the 
hearing process.  The parties may conduct discovery to develop the record 
for  all  portions  of  the  complaint  continuing  in  the  hearing  process.    The 

Management Directive 
5-27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Administrative Judge’s decision on the partial dismissal will become part 
of the Administrative Judge’s final decision on the complaint and may be 
appealed by either party after final action is taken on the complaint.  

2.   Where a Final Decision by the Agency Is Requested 

Where  a  complainant  requests  a  final  decision  by  the  agency  without  a 
hearing,  the  agency  will  issue  a  decision  addressing  all  claims  in  the 
complaint,  including  its  rationale  for  dismissing  claims,  if  any,  and  its 
findings on the merits of the remainder of the complaint.  The complainant 
may appeal the agency’s decision, including any partial dismissals, to the 
Commission. 

Agency decisions shall include the following: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits of each issue 
in the complaint; 

appropriate  remedies  and  relief  in  accordance  with  subpart  E  of 
part 1614 when discrimination is found; 

notice of right to appeal to the Commission (with EEOC Form 573, 
Notice of Appeal/Petition attached), unless the complaint involves 
a  mixed  case,  where  the  agency  should  provide  notice  of  right  to 
appeal to the MSPB (not the Commission) within thirty (30) days 
of receipt of the agency final decision; 

notice of right to file a civil action in a U.S. District Court; 

the name of the proper defendant in any such lawsuit; and 

the applicable time limits for appeals and lawsuits. 

D. 

Allegations of Dissatisfaction Regarding Processing of Pending Complaints 

1. 

If  a  complainant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  processing  of  his/her  pending 
complaint, whether or not it alleges prohibited discrimination as a basis for 
dissatisfaction,  including  that  agency  counsel/representatives  improperly 
interfered  during  the  investigation  of  the  complaint,  s/he  should  be 
referred  to  the  agency  official  responsible  for  the  quality  of  complaints 
processing. 
  Agency  officials  should  earnestly  attempt  to  resolve 
dissatisfaction  with  the  complaints  process  as  early  and  expeditiously  as 
possible. 

Management Directive

2. 

3. 

The  agency  official  responsible  for  the  quality  of  complaints  processing 
must  add  a  record  of  the  complainant’s  concerns  and  any  actions  the 
agency  took  to  resolve  the  concerns,  to  the  complaint  file  maintained  on 
the underlying complaint.  If no action was taken, the file must contain an 
explanation of the agency’s reason(s) for not taking any action. 

A complainant must always raise his/her concerns first with the agency, in 
the  above manner.  However,  in  cases where the complainant’s  concerns 
have not been resolved informally with the agency, the complainant may 
present those concerns to the Commission at either of the following stages 
of processing: 

a. 

b. 

the 
the  complainant  has  requested  a  hearing, 
Where 
Commission’s  Administrative  Judge  when  the  complaint  is  under 
the jurisdiction of the Administrative Judge; or 

to 

Where  the  complainant  has  not  requested  a  hearing,  to  the 
Commission’s Office of Federal Operations (OFO) on appeal. 

A complainant must raise any dissatisfaction with the processing of his/her 
complaint  before  the  Administrative  Judge  issues  a  decision  on  that 
complaint,  the  agency  takes  final  action  on  the  complaint,  or  either  the 
Administrative  Judge  or  the  agency  dismisses  the  complaint.    The 
complainant has the burden of showing improper processing.  No concerns 
regarding improper processing raised after a decision will be accepted by 
the agency, the Administrative Judge, or OFO.  

Where  the  Administrative  Judge  or  OFO  finds  that  an  agency  has 
improperly  processed  the  original  complaint  and  that  such  improper 
processing  has  had  a  material  effect  on  the  processing  of  the  original 
complaint, the Administrative Judge or OFO may impose sanctions on the 
agency  as  deemed  appropriate.    For  example,  where  the  complainant 
asserts that the agency’s investigation of the complaint was improper, the 
Administrative  Judge  may  determine  whether  the  complainant  has 
properly  characterized  the  investigation  and  whether  the  agency’s  failure 
properly  to  investigate  the  complaint  had  a  material  effect  on  the 
processing  of  the  complaint.    Or,  for  example,  where  the  complainant 
asserts  that  agency  counsel  or  representatives  improperly  directed,  or 
interfered  with,  the  investigation  of  the  complaint,  the  Administrative 
Judge  may  determine  whether  the  Agency  did,  in  fact,  interfere  in  the 
investigation, and whether such interference so undermined the neutrality 
of  the  investigation  that  it  materially  affected  the  processing  of  the 
complaint.    If  the  Administrative  Judge  finds  that  the  processing  of  the 

Management Directive 
5-29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complainant’s complaint was materially affected by the agency’s actions, 
the  Administrative  Judge  shall  issue  an  appropriate  order  addressing  the 
deficiencies  in  the  investigation.    If  the  Administrative  Judge  finds  that 
although  the  agency’s  actions  were  inconsistent  with  its  requirements 
under  the  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614  regulations,  but  had  no  material  effect  on 
the processing of the complaint, the Administrative Judge, in the exercise 
of his/her discretion,  may  suggest that the complainant  submit a letter to 
the following Commission office for consideration regarding the agency’s 
conduct: 

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
Office of Federal Operations 
Federal Sector Programs 
131 M Street, NE 
Washington, DC  20507 

Electronic  submission  may  be  made  using  email  transmission  of 
documents  to  federalsectoreeo@eeoc.gov  or  by  using  the  Commission’s 
electronic document submission portal. 

Where  the  complainant  contends  that  an  agency  improperly  denied 
him/her  official  time  and  the  Administrative  Judge  or  OFO  finds  in  the 
complainant’s  favor,  the  Administrative  Judge  or  OFO  may  order  the 
agency to restore such personal leave as the complainant may have used in 
lieu of official time. 

V. 

CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION 

A. 

Agency Retains Responsibility 

Agencies  are  responsible  for  conducting  an  appropriate  investigation  of 
complaints  filed  against  them.    An  agency  may  contract  out  an  investigation  or 
may  arrange  for  another  agency  to  conduct  the  investigation,  but  the  agency 
remains responsible for the content and timeliness of the investigation. 

B. 

Investigations Must Be Timely Completed 

Investigations  must  be  completed  within  180  days10
  of  filing  a  complaint  or 
within  the  time  period  contained  in  an  order  from  the  Office  of  Federal 

10  If  the  complaint  is  a  mixed  case,  the  investigation  must  be  finished  within  120  days.    MSPB

Operations to investigate a complaint following an appeal from a dismissal, unless 
the  EEO  Director  or  designee  and  the  complainant  agree  in  writing  to  an 
extension  of  not  more  than  an  additional  ninety  (90)  days.    Where  a  complaint 
has been amended or consolidated with another complaint, the investigation must 
be completed within the earlier of 180 days after the filing of the last complaint or 
not later than 360 days after the filing of the original complaint.  A complainant 
has  the  right  to  file  a  civil  action  or  request  a  hearing,  even  in  the  case  of 
consolidated  complaints,  after  180  days  have  passed  since  the  filing  of  the 
original complaint, even if the agency’s investigation has not been completed.   

Agencies  are  required  to  complete  investigations  within  the  earlier  of  180  days 
after  filing  last  complaint  or  360  days  after  the  filing  of  the  original  complaint.  
Regardless  of  amendment  of  or  consolidation  of  complaints,  the  investigation 
shall be complete in not more than 360 days.   

For example, if a complainant amends a complaint or files another complaint the 
agency will consolidate on day 179 of the originally filed complaint, and then the 
investigation must be complete by the 359th day.   

If  the  complainant  wants  to  add  another  amendment  on  the  358th  day  of  the 
investigation, the agency will have only 2 days to investigate that amendment.  If 
the  agency  is  unable  to  conduct  an  impartial  and  appropriate  investigation  in  2 
days it should not consolidate or accept the amendment; rather, the agency should 
advise the complainant to seek counseling on the newest matter and process it as a 
new complaint. 

C. 

Failure to Complete Investigation within Time Limit 

If  the  investigation  is  not  completed  within  the  180-day  time  limit,  the  agency 
must send a notice to complainant informing him/her that the investigation is not 
complete,  providing  an  estimated  date  by  which  it  will  be  complete  and 
explaining  that  s/he  has  a  right  to  request  a  hearing  from  a  Commission 
Administrative  Judge  or  to  file  a  civil  action  in  the  appropriate  U.S.  District 
Court.  The notice must be in writing, must describe the hearing process including 
some explanation of discovery and burdens of proof, and must acknowledge that 
its issuance does not bar complainant from seeking sanctions.  A sample notice is 
provided at Appendix K.

D.  What Must Be Done for an Investigation to Be Considered Appropriate 

A timely completed investigation means that within the applicable time period the 
agency must complete several actions: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The  complaint must be  appropriately investigated  in  a manner  consistent 
with  Chapter  6  of  this  Management  Directive.    An  appropriate  factual 
record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to 
whether discrimination occurred. 

Copies of the investigative file, including a summary of the investigation 
must be provided to the complainant(s)11

; and 

The  agency  must  give  complainant  a  notice  of  his/her  right  to  request  a 
hearing  (if  it  is  not  a  mixed  case),  within  30  days  from  receipt  of  the 
investigative file, , or of  the right to request  a final action by the agency 
pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.110. 

VI.  FINAL ACTIONS 

There  are  two  types  of  final  actions  by  agencies.    One  is  a  final  action  by  an  agency 
following a decision by an Administrative Judge.  The other is a final action in all other 
circumstances.  

A. 

Final Action by Agency Following an Administrative Judge’s Decision 

When an Administrative Judge issues a decision under 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.109 (b), 
(g), or (i), or § 1614.204(d)(7), the agency shall take final action on the complaint 
by  issuing  an  order  within  forty  (40)  days  of  the  date  of  its  receipt  of  the 
Administrative  Judge’s  decision.    The  agency’s  final  order  shall  inform  the 
complainant  as  to  whether  the  agency  will  fully  implement  that  decision.    The 
term  “fully  implement”  means  that  the  agency  adopts  without  modification  the 
decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge.    The  agency’s  final  order  shall  further 
inform the complainant of his/her right to file an appeal with the Commission, the 
right  to  file  a  civil  action  in  a  U.S.  District  Court,  the  name  of  the  proper 
defendant  in  such  appeal  or  civil  action,  and  the  applicable  time  limits  for  such 
appeals or civil actions.  If the agency’s final order does not fully implement the 
decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge,  the  agency  shall  file  an  appeal  with  the 
Commission  in  accordance  with  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.403,  appending  a  copy  of  its 

11  See  Chapter  6  of  this  Management  Directive  for  the  nature  and  content  of  an  investigative 

summary.

complainant.    A  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of  Appeal/Petition  - 
Complainant, shall be attached to the final order. 

When  an  Administrative  Judge  issues  a  decision  under  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204(j), 
the  agency  shall  take  final  action  on  the  complaint  by  issuing  an  order  within 
sixty (60) days of the date of its receipt of the Administrative Judge’s decision.  
The agency’s final order shall inform the class agent as to whether the agency will 
fully implement that decision.  The term “fully implement” means that the agency 
adopts  without  modification  the  decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge.    The 
agency’s final order further shall inform the class agent of his/her right to file an 
appeal  with  the  Commission,  the  right  to  file  a  civil  action  in  a  U.S.  District 
Court,  the  name  of  the  proper  defendant  in  such  appeal  or  civil  action,  and  the 
applicable time limits for such appeals or civil actions.  If the agency’s final order 
does  not  fully  implement  the  decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge,  the  agency 
shall  file  an  appeal  with  the  Commission  in  accordance  with  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.403, appending a copy of its appeal to the final order, simultaneously with 
its issuance of a decision to the class agent.  A copy of EEOC Form 573, Notice 
of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the final order. 

B. 

Final Actions in All Other Circumstances 

When  an  agency  dismisses  an  entire  complaint  under  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.107(a), 
receives a request for an immediate final decision, or does not receive a reply to 
the notice issued under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(f), the agency will take final action 
by issuing a final decision.  The final decision consists of findings by the agency 
on the merits of each claim in the complaint, or, as appropriate, the rationale for 
dismissing  any  claims  in  the  complaint  and,  when  discrimination  is  found, 
appropriate remedies, and relief in accordance with subpart E of Part 1614.  The 
agency will issue the final decision within sixty (60) days of receiving notification 
that a complainant has requested an immediate final decision from the agency, or 
within  60  days  of  the  end  of  the  thirty  (30)-day  period  for  the  complainant  to 
request  a  hearing  or  an  immediate  final  decision  where  the  complainant  has  not 
requested a hearing or a decision.   The  final decision shall contain notice of the 
right to appeal the final action to the Commission, the right to file a civil action in 
a U.S. District Court, the name of the proper defendant in any such lawsuit, and 
the applicable time limits for appeals and lawsuits.  A copy of EEOC Form 573, 
Notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the final decision/determination.

CHAPTER 6  
DEVELOPMENT OF IMPARTIAL AND APPROPRIATE 
FACTUAL RECORDS 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Section  1614.108(b)  of  Title  29  C.F.R.  requires  that  “the  agency  shall  develop  an 
impartial  and  appropriate  factual  record  upon  which  to  make  findings  on  the  claims 
raised  by  the  written  complaint.”    An  appropriate  factual  record  is  one  that  allows  a 
reasonable  fact  finder  to  draw  conclusions  as  to  whether  discrimination  occurred.   
Pursuant  to  that  regulation,  this  Chapter  prescribes  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity 
Commission’s  standards  for  impartiality  and  appropriateness  in  factual  findings  on 
formal complaints of discrimination.  Further, because continuing education and training 
for employees working in federal EEO is vitally important, this Chapter also establishes a 
mandatory  minimum  training  requirement  for  all  investigators,  including  contract  and 
collateral-duty investigators. 

This  Chapter  is  intended  to  ensure  that  federal  agencies  consistently  develop  sound 
factual bases for findings on claims raised in equal employment opportunity complaints 
while retaining the maximum flexibility in the use of fact-finding techniques and in the 
use of established dispute resolution plans.  This Management Directive is not intended 
as an exhaustive guide for conducting investigations, but represents the standard that the 
Commission expects in an investigation. 

II.  MINIMUM TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL INVESTIGATORS 

All  new  EEO  Investigators,  including  contract  and  collateral-duty  investigators,  must 
have completed  at  least  thirty-two (32) hours  of  investigator training  before conducting 
investigations.    In  addition  to  the  training  requirement  for  new  investigators,  all 
investigators  are  required  to  receive  at  least  eight  hours  of  continuing  investigator 
training every fiscal year.  The Commission has developed training courses to satisfy this 
requirement  and offers them to agencies through its Revolving  Fund Program on a fee-
for-service  basis.    Agencies  may  also  develop  their  own  courses  to  satisfy  this 
requirement or contract with others to provide training, as long as the training meets the 
standards provided below.

6. 

An overview of the entire EEO process pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  
This segment must emphasize important time frames in the EEO process, 
including relevant time frames for investigation. 

The  role  and  responsibility  of  an  EEO  Investigator,  as  described  in  this 
Management Directive. 

A thorough presentation of the relevant statutes, including Title VII of the 
Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as  amended  (includes  the  Pregnancy  Act  of 
1978),  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  as  amended,  the  Americans  with 
Disabilities Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 
of 1967, as amended, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended, and Title II 
of  the  Genetic  Information  Nondiscrimination  Act  of  2008,  42  U.S.C. 
§ 2000ff et seq.  This module must explain the theories of discrimination 
relevant  to  these  statutes,  including  disparate  treatment,  adverse  impact, 
and  reasonable  accommodation  theories.    This  module  must  provide 
detailed  instruction  concerning  issues  attendant  to  fragmentation.    See 
Chapter 5, Section III of this Management Directive. 

Case  management  issues,  including  information  on  practical  techniques 
concerning the timely investigation of complaints. 

Remedies,  including  compensatory  damages,  attorney’s  fees,  and  costs.   
This module must provide investigators with practical information on how 
to  gather  relevant  information  in  cases  where  remedies,  attorney’s  fees, 
and costs are at issue. 

Investigative  techniques,  such  as  the  gathering  and  analysis  of  evidence.  
Participants  should  be  provided  with  an  opportunity  to  get  practical, 
hands-on  experience  during  this  module  on  topics  such  as  interviewing 
witnesses,  making  credibility  determinations,  and  the  gathering  and 
reviewing of documentary and electronic evidence.  Participants should be 
provided with case studies to work with so that investigative skills can be 
effectively developed.

Standards for Continuing Investigator Training 

The continuing eight hours of investigator training every fiscal year is intended to 
keep  EEO  Investigators  informed  of  developments  in  EEO  practice,  law,  and 
guidance,  as  well  as  to  enhance  and  develop  investigatory  skills.    Agencies  are 
encouraged to conduct a needs assessment to determine specific investigative staff 
training needs.  The Commission anticipates that these eight hours of continuing 
investigator training will include segments on legal and policy updates, regulatory 
and statutory changes, and investigative skills development. 

III.  RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. 

Director of Equal Employment Opportunity 

The  Director  of  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  shall  ensure  that  1)  all  new 
investigators  receive  at  least  thirty-two  (32)  hours  of  introductory  investigator 
training before conducting investigations and that all investigators receive at least 
eight  hours  of  continuing  investigator  training  every  year;  2)  the  claim(s)  in  a 
complaint are thoroughly  investigated; 3) all employees  of the  agency  cooperate 
in the investigation; and 4) witness testimony is given under oath or affirmation 
and  without  a  promise  that  the  agency  will  keep  the  testimony  or  information 
provided confidential.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.102(c)(5). 

The  EEO  Director  will  also  ensure  that  individual  complaints  are  properly  and 
thoroughly investigated and that all final actions are issued in a timely manner in 
accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1614.110.  The EEO Director also must ensure that 
there  is  no  conflict  of  interest  or  appearance  of  conflict  of  interest  in  the 
investigation  of  complaints.    See  Chapter  1  Section  4  of  this  Management 
Directive for more information. 

B. 

Equal Employment Opportunity Investigator  

The Equal Employment Opportunity Investigator is a person officially designated 
and  authorized  to  conduct  inquiries  into  claims  raised  in  EEO  complaints.    The 
authorization includes the authority to administer oaths and to require employees 
testimony  under  oath  or  affirmation  without  a  promise  of 
to  furnish 
confidentiality.    The  investigator  does  not  make  or  recommend  a  finding  of 
discrimination.

C. 

Complainant 

The  complainant  must  cooperate  in  the  investigation  and  keep  the  agency 
informed  of  his/her  current  address.    If  an  agency  is  unable  to  locate  the 
complainant,  the  agency  may  dismiss  the  complaint,  provided  that  reasonable 
efforts  have  been  made  to  locate  the  complainant  and  the  complainant  has  not 
responded within fifteen (15) days of the notice of proposed dismissal.  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a)(6). 

Where the agency has provided the complainant with a written request to provide 
relevant information or otherwise proceed with the complaint, coupled with a 15-
day notice of proposed dismissal, a failure to respond could result in dismissal of 
the complaint.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(7); Chapter 5, Section IV.B.1 of this 
Management Directive. 

IV. 

INVESTIGATION 

An investigation of a formal complaint of discrimination is an official review or inquiry, 
by  persons  authorized  to  conduct  such  review  or  inquiry,  into  claims  raised  in  an  EEO 
complaint.   

The  investigative  process  is  non-adversarial.    That  means  that  the  investigator  is 
obligated to collect evidence regardless of the parties’ positions with respect to the items 
of evidence.  

A copy of the complaint shall be provided to the investigator prior to the commencement 
of the investigation.   

Models for the analysis of common types of discrimination cases appear at Appendix J to 
this Management Directive. 

A.  Methods of Investigation  

Investigative inquiries may be made using a variety of fact-finding models, such 
as the interview or the fact-finding conference, and a variety of devices, such as 
requests for information, position statements, exchange of letters or memoranda,

EEO MD-110 

interrogatories, and affidavits.  The inquiry/review process  may  also  incorporate 
some of the features of a dispute resolution plan.   

B. 

Purpose of the Investigation  

The purpose of the investigation is 1) to gather facts upon which a reasonable fact 
finder may draw conclusions as to whether an agency subject to coverage under 
the  statutes  that  the  Commission  enforces  in  the  federal  sector  has  violated  a 
provision  of  any  of  those  statutes;  and  2)  if  a  violation  is  found,  to  have  a 
sufficient factual basis from which to fashion an appropriate remedy.1

C. 

General Investigative Requirements  

The  investigation  shall  include  a  thorough  review  of  the  circumstances  under 
which  the  alleged  discrimination  occurred;  the  treatment  of  members  of  the 
complainant’s  group  as  compared  with  the  treatment  of  other  similarly  situated 
employees, if any;2
 and any policies and/or practices that may constitute or appear 
to  constitute  discrimination,  even  though  they  have  not  been  expressly  cited  by 
the complainant. 

1  The  Commission  enforces:    (1)  Section  717  of  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as 
amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16; (2) Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 
29 U.S.C.  §§  791  and  794a;  (3)  Section  15  of  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act  of  1967,  as 
amended, 29 U.S.C. § 633a; (4) the Equal Pay Act, Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
as  amended,  29  U.S.C.  §  296(d);  and  (5) Title  II  of  the  Genetic  Information  Nondiscrimination  Act  of 
2008, 42 U.S.C. § 2000ff et seq. 

2 Investigators are reminded that even where the complainant is unable to provide comparative data 
and  the  investigator  similarly  cannot  obtain  any  such  information,  the  investigator  still  must  determine 
whether there is other evidence that may establish unlawful discrimination.  In O’Connor v. Consolidated 
Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308 (1996), the Supreme Court ruled that comparative evidence is not an 
essential element of a prima facie case of discrimination, but the complainant must come forward with 
sufficient evidence to create an inference of discrimination; that is, enough evidence that, if not rebutted, 
would support an inference that the agency's actions resulted from discrimination.  Furnco Construction 
Co.  v.  Waters,  438  U.S.  567,  576  (1978).    The  Commission  has  issued  enforcement  guidance  on 
O’Connor,  entitled  “EEOC Enforcement Guidance on O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,”

D. 

Failure to Complete Investigation within Time Limit  

Agencies  are  required  to  complete  investigations  within  the  earlier  of  180  days 
after  the  filing  of  the  last  complaint  or  360  days  after  the  filing  of  the  original 
complaint.    Regardless  of  amendment  of  or  consolidation  of  complaints,  the 
investigation  shall  be  complete  in  not  more  than  360  days,  unless  there  is  a 
written extension of not more than 90 days.   

For example, if a complainant amends a complaint or files another complaint the 
agency  will  consolidate  on  day  179  of  the  originally  filed  complaint,  then  the 
investigation must be complete by the 359th day.   

If  the  complainant  wants  to  add  another  amendment  on  the  358th  day  of  the 
investigation,  the  agency  will  have  only  2  days  to  investigate  that  amendment 
unless the complainant agrees in writing to an extension of not more than 90 days.  
When no written extension exists and the agency is unable to conduct an impartial 
and  appropriate  investigation  in  2  days  it  should  not  consolidate  or  accept  the 
amendment rather, the agency should advise the  complainant to seek counseling 
on the newest matter and process it as a new complaint. 

See Chapter 5, Section V.C of this Management Directive regarding an agency’s 
failure to complete the investigation in a timely manner. 

V. 

THE ROLE OF THE INVESTIGATOR 

A. 

Collecting and Discovering Factual Information 

The role of the investigator is to collect and to discover factual information con-
cerning  the  claim(s)  in  the  complaint  under  investigation  and  to  prepare  an 
investigative summary.   

B. 

Variety of Methods Available 

The  investigator  may  accomplish  his/her  mission  in  a  variety  of  ways.    The 
investigator may function as: 

1. 

2. 

a presiding official at a fact-finding conference; 

an examiner responsible for developing material evidence;

an  issuer  of  requests  for  information  in  the  form  of  requests  for  the 
production of documents, interrogatories, and affidavits;  

a face-to-face interviewer in on-site visits; and/or, 

any other role so long as appropriate investigative techniques/methods are 
utilized.   

C. 

Investigator Must Be Unbiased and Objective  

In  whatever  the  mix  of  fact-finding  activity  selected  for  a  particular  case,  the 
investigator  must  be  and  must  maintain  the  appearance  of  being  unbiased, 
objective,  and  thorough.    S/he  must  be  neutral  in  his/her  approach  to  factual 
development.    The  investigator  is  not  an  advocate  for  any  of  the  parties  or 
interests and should refrain from developing allegiances to them.  In addition, the 
following rules must be observed: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The  person  assigned  to  investigate  shall  not  occupy  a  position  in  the 
agency  that  is  directly  or  indirectly  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  head  of 
that part of the agency in which the complaint arose. 

The investigator, if a contract investigator, shall not have been hired by or 
be  obligated  to  the  person(s)  involved  in  the  claims  giving  rise  to  the 
complaint.  For example, where the contract monitor of EEO investigation 
contracts  is  alleged  to  have  been  involved  in  discriminatory  activity,  the 
use  of  the  usual  contract  investigator  would  create  an  apparent  bias 
because there is at best the appearance that the contract investigator could 
not be impartial.  

An agency is prohibited, in some situations, from using its own immediate 
investigative  resources,  even  though  the  investigation  of  discrimination 
complaints  in  the  federal  service  is  primarily  an  agency  function  and 
responsibility.    In  such  cases  the  agency  shall  use  alternatives,  such  as 
contract investigators or other outside sources.  See Chapter I, Section IV 
of this Management Directive for additional information regarding conflict 
of interest cases.  Such situations include, but are not limited to: 

a. 

Particularly  sensitive  cases  involving  high-level  officials  (for 
example, complainant is an immediate subordinate of  the  head of 
the  agency  and  the  head  of  the  agency  is  alleged  to  have  taken 
discriminatory action).

EEO MD-110

b. 

c. 

Potential  conflict  of  interest  (for  example,  complainant  is  an 
employee  in  the  EEO  office  and  names  the  EEO  Director  as  the 
person taking the wrongful action). 

A small agency unable to carry out an unexpected EEO workload 
(for  example,  an  agency  with  fewer  than  450  employees,  has  a 
staff  of  part-time  or  ad  hoc  EEO  Investigators,  and  is  unable  to 
absorb an additional investigative caseload). 

D. 

Investigator Must Be Thorough  

This  means  identifying  and  obtaining  all  relevant  evidence  from  all  sources 
regardless of how it may  affect the outcome.    Investigators need not  expend the 
same amount of investigatory effort on each case, however.  The proper scope of 
an investigation is dictated by the facts at issue.  Investigators should not take a 
cookie-cutter,  one-size-fits-all  approach,  as  that  wastes  resources  and  delays 
resolution of the complaint.  The investigation and the amount of effort expended 
should  be  appropriate  to  determine  the  claims  raised  by  the  complaint.    An 
appropriate  investigation  is  one  that  allows  a  reasonable  fact  finder  to  draw 
conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred. 

An  investigator  should  ensure  that  his/her  questions  are  answered  by  a  witness 
with personal knowledge of the facts rather than by a party’s representative.  The 
investigator  need  not  concern  himself/herself  with  balancing  the  amount  of 
evidence  supporting  the  complainant  as  compared  with  the  amount  of  evidence 
supporting  the  agency.    To  ensure  a  balanced  record,  it  is  necessary  only  to 
exhaust those sources likely to support the complainant and the respondent.  An 
investigation conducted in this manner might reveal that there is ample evidence 
to  support  the  complainant’s  claims  and  no  evidence  to  support  the  agency’s 
version  of  the  facts,  or  vice  versa.    Nevertheless,  this  investigation  would  be 
thorough.    The  best  type  of  investigations  allow  for  complainant  to  provide 
rebuttal  evidence  with  sufficient  time  for  the  investigator  to  address  any  issues 
raised within the regulatory time frames.

VI.  EVIDENCE  

A. 

Quality of Evidence 

EEO MD-110 

Evidence will be gathered from the complainant, witnesses, and other sources.  In 
order  to  support  findings  and,  ultimately,  decisions,  this  evidence  should  be 
material to the complaint, relevant to the issue(s) raised in the complaint, and as 
reliable as possible.   

1. 

Material Evidence  

Evidence is material when it relates to one or more of the issues raised in 
the  complaint  or  raised  by  the  agency’s  answer  to  it.    To  determine 
whether  evidence 
the  claims  of 
discriminatory conduct and resultant harm contained in the complaint and 
the agency’s answers to the claims.  If the evidence relates to one or more 
of those claims, then it relates to the issues presented in the complaint, and 
it is material. 

is  material,  one  must 

look 

to 

2. 

Relevant Evidence  

Evidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove a material issue raised 
by a complaint.  Relevancy and materiality are often used interchangeably.  
Generally, relevance is the more important concept in an investigation.  If 
evidence is not relevant, whether it is material is of little consequence.  A 
test of relevance is to ask, “What does this evidence tend to prove?”  If the 
answer is that it tends to prove or disprove a proposition that is related to 
the complaint, then the evidence is relevant. 

3. 

Reliable Evidence  

Evidence  is  reliable  if  it  is  dependable  or  trustworthy.    Evidence  should 
not be ignored because it is of questionable reliability.  Such evidence may 
lead to evidence that is reliable.   

Some factors to consider in determining whether testimony is reliable are: 
whether  the  witness’s  testimony  is  based  on  his/her  own  experience  and 
personal knowledge, or based on rumor, hearsay, or innuendo; whether the 
testimony  is  a  statement  of  fact  or  is  merely  a  conclusion;  and  whether 
witnesses  have  an  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the  complaint,  or  are 
otherwise biased.

EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

Some  factors  to  consider  in  determining  whether  documents  are  reliable 
are:  whether  they  were  prepared  in  response  to  the  investigation  or 
whether  they  are  maintained  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business;  whether 
they  are  obtained  from  the  custodian  of  records  or  the  author  of  the 
document; and whether the documents are signed and/or dated. 

The federal rules of evidence were designed to set limits on the reliability 
of  documents  and  testimony  entered  in  evidence  in  court.    Such  formal 
rules  will  not  be  strictly  applied  in  the  collection  of  evidence  for  the 
investigation of federal equal employment opportunity complaints.   Such 
rules may be used, however, as a guide in assessing the evidentiary weight 
to be given particular items of evidence.   

B. 

Types of Evidence  

There are many types of evidence which can be obtained on the issues raised in an 
equal  employment  complaint.    The  three  basic  types  of  evidence  are  direct 
evidence, circumstantial evidence, and statistical evidence.  

1. 

Direct Evidence 

Direct evidence is evidence that proves a fact without resort to inference 
or presumption.  Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009).  For example, in 
the  morning  the  ground  is  covered  with  snow.    If  you  looked  out  the 
window  the  night  before  and  saw  it  snowing  then,  you  have  direct 
evidence  that  it  snowed  during  the  night.    You  need  not  draw  any 
inference to reach the factual conclusion that it snowed during the night. 

Direct  evidence  is  relevant  in  cases  involving  disparate  treatment  where 
the  question  is  whether  the  employer  intentionally  treated  employees 
differently  because  of  a  protected  factor.    It  is  also  relevant  in  cases 
involving  the  effect  of  policies  where  the  question  is  whether  the  policy 
disparately treats all employees in the protected class. 

Direct  evidence  is  rare.    The  statement,  “I  would  never  hire  you  for  that 
job because you are a woman,” is direct evidence of discrimination on the 
basis  of  sex  in  hiring,  but  would  not  be  direct  evidence  if  the  issue 
involved a performance appraisal, for example. 

Agencies must take care to distinguish between direct evidence of bias and 
direct evidence of discrimination.  Direct evidence of bias may be strong

example,  the  statement,  “I  would  never  hire  a  woman  for  that  job,”  is 
direct evidence of bias, as not directed towards any specific person.  See 
Heim v. State of Utah, 8 F.3d 1541, 1546 (10th Cir. 1993).  In contrast, a 
statement to a complainant that you “may be getting too old to understand 
the  store’s  new  computer  programs”  was  deemed  direct  evidence  of 
discrimination  in  Wright  v.  Southland  Corp.,  187  F.3d  1287,  1304  (11th 
Cir. 1999) because it was directed at a specific person.   

2. 

Circumstantial Evidence  

Circumstantial  evidence  is  evidence  based  on  inference.    Black’s  Law 
Dictionary  (9th  ed.  2009).    In  other  words,  the  fact  finder  must  draw  an 
inference from the evidence to reach a factual conclusion. 

For  example, if  you looked  out the window  at night and the  ground was 
bare, but when you look out the window the next morning, there is snow 
on  the  ground,  the  snow  on  the  ground  is  circumstantial  evidence  that  it 
snowed during the night.  From the presence of snow on the ground, you 
reasonably may infer that it snowed during the night.  You have drawn an 
inference to reach the factual conclusion that it snowed during the night. 

There  are  different  types  of  circumstantial  evidence.    For  example, 
comparative  evidence  must  be  sought  in  every  case  alleging  disparity  in 
treatment  on  a  basis  protected  by  a  law  enforced  by  the  Commission.  
Comparative  evidence  is  evidence  regarding  how  similarly  situated 
persons outside of the complainant’s protected groups were treated. 

In  general,  similarly  situated  means  that  the  persons  who  are  being 
compared  are  so  situated  that  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  they  would 
receive the same treatment as the complainant in the context of a particular 
employment decision.  It is important to remember that individuals may be 
similarly situated  for one employment decision,  but not for  another.  For 
example,  a  female  GS-4  clerk-typist  may  be  similarly  situated  to  a  male 
GS-7 paralegal in  a discrimination  case  involving the  approval  of  annual 
leave  where  the  same  rules  are  applied  to  both  employees  by  the  same 
supervisor or where both are in the same unit or subject to the same chain 
of  command.    The  investigator  would  be  obligated  to  find  out  whether 
there  were persons,  not named by the complainant but similarly situated, 
whose treatment could be compared to the complainant’s treatment.3
  Both 

3 While comparative evidence is important, it is not always available, and an investigator may be 
able to obtain other evidence of discrimination.  So while the investigator should make an effort to obtain 
comparative evidence, s/he also should make an effort to determine whether there may be other evidence

the complainant and the responding management official should provide a 
list of comparators for the challenged action. 

Other  types  of  circumstantial  evidence  may  include  general  statements 
indicative of bias (see the example in “Direct Evidence,” above), conduct 
(for  example,  a  selecting  official  repeatedly  has  selected  only  males  for 
job vacancies, despite the availability of best-qualified female candidates), 
or  environment  (for  example,  an  absence  of  Hispanics  in  the  workplace 
despite  their  availability  in  the  relevant  labor  force).    Circumstantial 
evidence may overlap with statistical evidence. 

3. 

Statistical Evidence  

Statistical  evidence  or  a  survey  of  the  general  environment  may  be 
conducted  as  appropriate.    For  example,  this  evidence  may  be  probative 
when claims involve the comparative treatment of groups, as in a claim of 
a pattern or practice of discrimination, or the adverse effect of an agency 
policy or practice.   

C. 

Sources of Evidence  

1. 

The Complainant  

The  complaint  will  generally  provide  the  initial  information  concerning 
the  bases,  issues,  and  incidents  that  gave  rise  to  the  complaint  of 
discrimination.    The  complaint  may  also  indicate  the  reason,  if  any  was 
given, for any adverse employment decision.  Additional background and 
detailed information must be obtained from the complainant and recorded 
through  written  questions  and  answers  (interrogatories),  recorded 
interviews  (using  handwritten  notes  or  verbatim  transcription),  an 
exchange  of  letters  or  memoranda,  or  a  fact-finding  conference.    This 
information  should  include  medical  documentation,  where  necessary.   
Witness testimony intended to be made a part of the complaint file should 
be made under oath or affirmation or penalty of perjury.  

Volume  II  of  the  Commission’s  Compliance  Manual  will  assist  in 
developing inquiries.  That volume contains substantive topics arranged in 
sections.    Most  sections  contain  advice  on  what  questions  to  ask  when 
certain  issues  are  raised.    The  Commission’s  Compliance  Manual  is 

equally probative of discrimination.

published  commercially  and  is  available  at  many  libraries  and  at  the 
Commission’s  district,  area,  and  field  offices.    In  addition,  newly  issued 
sections  of  the  Compliance  Manual  and  Commission  policy  guidance  on 
issues such as reprisal, definition of disability, reasonable accommodation, 
and sexual harassment are available on the Commission’s website at: 
http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/compliance.cfm. 

2. 

The Agency  

Information  from  the  agency  may  be  obtained  initially  through  a  request 
for  information.    Consult  the  agency  EEO  Director  for  instructions 
concerning to whom to direct the request.   

Follow-up information should be obtained in a variety of ways, including 
further requests, affidavits, interrogatories, or a fact-finding conference. 

In most instances, the individual who initiated or enforced the decision or 
engaged in the action about which the complaint was filed should be 
interviewed early in the investigation.  His/her reasons for the action will 
often open other avenues to explore.   

For  this  reason,  a  management  official’s  explanation  of  a  challenged 
action  should  be  detailed  and  specific.    In  a  non-selection  type  case, 
stating  the  person  selected  was  better  qualified  or  a  better  fit  for  the 
position  is  insufficient  standing  alone. 
  Interview  notes  and  any 
explanation should include a narrative as to why the management official 
believes the selectee was a better candidate. 

3. 

Witnesses  

Witnesses  can  be  identified  by  asking  the  complainant,  the  official 
involved in the alleged discriminatory action, or other obvious witnesses if 
they are aware of other persons who might have information related to the 
complaint.  Witnesses need not be employees at the respondent agency. 

a. 

The  EEO  staff  may  be  of  some  assistance  in  discovering  other 
witnesses,  but  they  should  rarely  be  witnesses  themselves.    Their 
information  will  usually  be  hearsay  and  their  participation  as 
witnesses would compromise their objectivity.  Information should 
be obtained from its primary source. 

b. 

Witness bias should be noted when it is discovered.  The following 
should  be  noted:  1)  favorable  feelings  toward  a  party  based  on  a 

Management Directive 
6-13

mutual  alliance,  family  ties,  or  close  friendship;  2)  hostility  to  a 
party,  because  of  a  past  disagreement;  and  3)  self-interest  in  the 
outcome  of  the  complaint  are  some  indicators  of  potential  bias.   
The  indicators  should  be  made  a  part  of  the  record,  and  efforts 
should be made to corroborate the testimony.  The weight accorded 
the  evidence  by  the  fact  finder  adduced  from  such  witnesses  will 
be governed by the degree to which it can be determined that the 
bias colored the testimony.   

4. 

Documentary Evidence  

All  relevant  documents  should  be  obtained.    The  complainant,  the 
supervisor,  the  manager  who  took  the  personnel  action,  or  the  personnel 
office of the agency may be sources to help identify relevant documents. 

Statistical evidence usually can be obtained through the EEO Office or the 
personnel office of the agency. 

D. 

Evidence on the Question of Remedies  

The investigator should gather evidence that will allow for an appropriate remedy 
to be fashioned.  This essentially means that a determination of the parameters of 
relief should be made and the appropriate inquiries developed.  Agencies should 
be aware that, during the investigative process, they need to address evidence that 
may be used in connection with framing remedies.  Evidence on the question of 
remedies may include evidence of a complainant’s interim earnings or subsequent 
promotions  (in  a  discharge  or  non-promotion  case),  compensatory  damages,  or 
other  mitigating  factors.    For  a  source  of  information  concerning  compensatory 
damages,  see  Enforcement  Guidance;  Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages 
Available  under  §  102  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991,  N-915.002  (July  14, 
1992).4

4  The  Commission  prepared  this  Enforcement  Guidance  for  use  in  both  public  and  private  EEO 
litigation.  The discussion in the Enforcement Guidance concerning punitive damages does not apply to 
federal sector EEO.

VII.  WITNESSES AND REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FEDERAL EEO 

PROCESS 

The  procedures  outlined  here  relate  specifically  to  the  processing  of  individual 
complaints  of  discrimination  under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.108.    The  principles  reflected  in 
these  procedures,  however,  should  also  guide  the  processing  of  class  complaints  of 
discrimination under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204. 

A. 

Disclosure of Investigative Material to Witnesses  

1. 

To the Complainant 

The complainant must receive a copy of the complaint file and a transcript 
of the hearing, if a hearing is held.  The complainant should be given the 
opportunity to receive a copy of the complaint file and hearing transcript 
in an electronic format as an alternative to the paper files/documents.  The 
complainant  should  receive  the  same  copy  of  the  complaint  file  as  the 
agency  counsel  does  and  where  a  hearing  was  requested  as  the 
Administrative Judge does. 

2. 

To Other Witnesses 

During  the  investigation,  the  investigator  may  disclose  information  and 
documents to a witness who is a federal employee where the investigator 
determines  that  the  disclosure  of  the  information  or  documents  is 
necessary to obtain information from the witness, for example, to explain 
the claims in a complaint or to explain a manager’s articulated reason for 
an  action  in  order  to  develop  evidence  bearing  on  that  reason.  
Explanations  of  a  witness’  credibility  are  helpful,  and  the  investigator 
should  include  observations  on  credibility  without  making  a  final 
conclusion as to credibility.

Complainant or Applicant Not Employed by Federal Government 

The agency is not responsible, however, for paying the travel expenses of 
a  complainant  or  applicant  who  is  not  employed  by  the  federal 
government.    Although  the  complainant  who,  for  purposes  of  his/her 
complaint  is  a  witness,  may  once  have  been  employed  by  the  agency 
against  whom  s/he  complains,  the  termination  of  the  employment  status 
with the federal government also terminates any federal obligation to pay 
travel expenses associated with prosecution of the complaint.  Expenses of

C. 

Official Time  

Section 1614.605 of 29 C.F.R. provides that individuals/complainants are entitled 
to  a  representative  of  their  choice  during  the  administrative  EEO  pre-complaint 
counseling  and  at  all stages of the  administrative EEO complaint process.   Both 
the complainant and the representative, if they are employees of the agency where 
the complaint arose and was filed, are entitled to a reasonable amount of official 
time to present the complaint and to respond to agency requests for information, if 
otherwise  on  duty.    29  C.F.R.  §  1614.605(b).    Former  employees  of  an  agency 
who initiate the EEO process concerning an adverse action relating to their prior 
employment  with  the  agency  are  employees  within  the  meaning  of  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.605, and their representatives, if they are current employees of the agency,

are entitled to official time.  Witnesses who are federal employees, regardless of 
whether  they  are  employed  by  the  respondent  agency  or  some  other  federal 
agency, shall be in a duty status when their presence is authorized or required by 
Commission or agency officials in connection with the complaint.  

1. 

Reasonable Amount of Official Time 

“Reasonable”  is  defined  as  whatever  is  appropriate,  under  the  particular 
circumstances of the complaint, in order to allow a complete presentation 
of the relevant information  associated with the  complaint and to  respond 
to agency requests for information.  The actual number of hours to which 
complainant and his/her representative are entitled will vary, depending on 
the nature and complexity of the complaint and considering the mission of 
the  agency  and  the  agency’s  need  to  have  its  employees  available  to 
perform their normal duties on a regular basis.  The complainant and the 
agency should arrive at a mutual understanding as to the amount of official 
time to be used prior to the complainant’s use of such time.  Time spent 
commuting  to  and  from  home  should  not  be  included  in  official  time 
computations because all employees are required to commute to and from 
their federal employment on their own time. 

2. 

Meeting and Hearing Time 

Most  of  the  time  spent  by  complainants  and  their  representatives  during 
the  processing  of  a  typical  complaint  is  spent  in  meetings  and  hearings 
with  agency  officials  or  with  the  Commission  Administrative  Judges.  
Whatever  time  is  spent  in  such  meetings  and  hearings  is  automatically 
deemed reasonable.  Both the complainant and the representative are to be 
granted official time for the duration of such meetings or hearings and are 
in  a  duty  status  regardless  of  their  tour  of  duty.    If  a  complainant  or 
representative has already worked a full week and must attend a hearing or 
meeting  on  an  off  day,  that  complainant  or  representative  is  entitled  to 
official  time,  which  may  require  that  the  agency  pay  overtime.    The 
complainant should notify the agency of the meeting and hearing schedule 
as soon as possible.

3. 

Preparation Time 

Since  presentation  of  a  complaint  involves  preparation  for  meetings  and 
hearings,  as  well  as  attendance  at  such  meetings,  conferences,  and 
hearings,  complainants  and  their  representatives  are  also  afforded  a 
reasonable  amount  of  official  time,  as  defined  above,  to  prepare  for 
meetings and hearings.  They are also to be afforded a reasonable amount 
of official time to prepare the formal complaint and any appeals that may 
be  filed  with  the  Commission,  even  though  no  meetings  or  hearings  are 
involved.    However,  because  investigations  are  conducted  by  agency  or 
Commission personnel, the regulation does not envision large amounts of 
official  time  for  preparation  purposes.    Consequently,  “reasonable,”  with 
respect to preparation time (as opposed to time actually spent in meetings 
and hearings), is generally defined in terms of hours, not in terms of days, 
weeks,  or  months.    Again,  what  is  reasonable  depends  on  the  individual 
circumstances  of  each  complaint.    See  Murry  v.  General  Services 
Administration, EEOC Appeal No. 0120093069 (July 26, 2012). 

4. 

Aggregate Time Spent on EEO Matters by Representative 

The  Commission  considers  it  reasonable  for  agencies  to  expect  their 
employees to spend most of their time doing the work for which they are 
employed.  Therefore, an agency may restrict the overall hours of official 
time  afforded  to  a  representative,  for  both  preparation  purposes  and  for 
attendance  at  meetings  and  hearings,  to  a  certain  percentage  of  that 
representative’s  duty  hours  in  any  given  month,  quarter,  or  year.    Such 
overall restrictions would depend on the nature of the position occupied by 
the  representative,  the  relationship  of  that  position  to  the  mission  of  the 
agency, and the degree of hardship imposed on the mission of the agency 
by the representative’s absence from his/her normal duties.  The amount of 
official time to be afforded to an employee for representational activities 
will vary with the circumstances.  

Moreover,  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.605(c)  provides  that  in  cases  where  the 
representation of a complainant or agency would conflict with the official 
or  collateral  duties  of  the  representative,  the  Commission  or  the  agency 
may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify 
the  representative.    At  all  times,  the  complainant  is  responsible  for 
proceeding with the complaint, regardless of whether s/he has a designated 
representative. 

The  Commission  does  not  require  agencies  to  provide  official  time  to 
employee  representatives  who  are  representing  complainants  in  cases

against  other  federal  agencies.    However,  the  Commission  encourages 
agencies to provide such official time. 

5.  

Requesting Official Time 

The agency must establish a process for deciding how much official time 
it will provide a complainant.  Agencies further must inform complainants, 
their  representatives,  and  others  who  may  need  official  time,  such  as 
witnesses, of the process and how to claim or request official time. 

6. 

Denial of Official Time 

If the agency denies a request for official time, either in whole or in part, 
the  agency  must  include  a  written  statement  in  the  complaint  file  noting 
the reasons for the denial.  If the agency’s denial of official time is made 
before  the  complaint  is  filed,  the  agency  shall  provide  the  complainant 
with  a  written  explanation  for  the  denial,  which  it  will  include  in  the 
complaint file if the complainant subsequently files a complaint.  Where a 
request for official time is denied in whole or part while an Administrative 
Judge is presiding over the matter, a copy of the agency’s denial of official

Administrative Judge when provided to the requestor.  

the  requisite  explanation  should  be  provided 

to 

D. 

Duty Status/Tour of Duty 

For  purposes  of  these  regulations,  “duty  status”  means  the  complainant’s  or 
representative’s normal hours of work.   

It  is  expected  that  the  agency  will,  to  the  extent  practical,  schedule  meetings 
during  the  complainant’s  normal  working  hours  and  that  agency  officials  shall 
provide official time for complainants and representatives to attend such meetings 
and hearings.   

If meetings, conferences, and hearings are scheduled outside of the complainant’s 
or the representative’s normal work hours, agencies should adjust or rearrange the 
complainant’s  or  representative’s  work  schedule  to  coincide  with  such  meetings 
or hearings, or grant compensatory time or official time to allow an approximately 
equivalent time off during normal hours of work.  The selection of the appropriate 
method for making the complainant or representative available in any individual 
circumstance shall be within the discretion of the agency.

EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

Any  reasons  for  an  agency’s  denial  of  official  time  should  be  fully  documented 
and made a part of the complaint file, and if an Administrative Judge is presiding 
over  the  matter  at  the  time  of  the  request,  then  it  should  be  provided  to  the 
Administrative Judge at the same time as it is provided to the requestor. 

Witnesses,  who  are  federal  employees,  regardless  of  their  tour  of  duty  and 
whether they are employed by the respondent  agency or another federal agency, 
must  be  in  a  duty  status  when  their  presence  is  authorized  or  required  by 
Commission or agency officials in connection with a complaint. 

E. 

Use of Government Property 

The  complainant’s  or  complainant’s  non-attorney  representative’s  use  of 
government  property  (copiers,  telephones,  word  processors,  computers,  internet, 
printers, and email) must be authorized prior to their use by the agency and must 
not cause undue disruption of agency operations.  

VIII.  COMPLAINT FILE 

A. 

Contents of the Complaint File  

The complaint file must include all various documents and information acquired 
during the fact-finding under this Directive.  The complaint file will be assembled 
as an electronic document, unless the agency has demonstrated good cause as to 
why the agency  cannot  produce a digital copy of the file, in which case a paper 
file may be submitted.  While cost alone does not constitute good cause why an 
agency  cannot  submit  files  in  a  digital  format,  OFO  will  consider  facts  such  as 
undue cost, undue burden, national security concerns, and other reasonable bases.  
The complaint file must contain all documents pertinent to the complaint, and be 
in the form and format as provided in Appendix L, as demonstrated in the sample 
complaint file available on the Commission’s website at www.eeoc.gov/federal/.  

B. 

Complaint Files Should Not Include 

The complaint file should not include confidential documentation concerning the 
substance  of  attempts  to  resolve  the  complaint  during  informal  counseling  or 
during any alternative dispute resolution procedure.

Redactions 

EEO MD-110 

Agencies  should  not  place  non-relevant  information  in  complaint  files.    Where 
names,  social  security  numbers,  home  addresses,  and  any  other  personal 
identifying  information  are  not  relevant,  that  information  should  be  redacted 
before the document containing them is included in the compliant file.  Relevant 
information that should not be redacted includes management and/or comparative 
employees’/applicants’  names.    Once  a  document  is  included  in  the  complaint 
file, the complainant has a right to the entire file.  All parties including the agency 
representative, the complainant and his/her counsel, and the Administrative Judge 
should  all  have  the  same  complaint  file,  either  without  redactions  or  containing 
the same redactions.5

D. 

Features of the Complaint File  

The digital complaint file shall have the following features: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

File should be image over text or run through OCR text recognition such 
that it is a searchable document. 

It  should  contain  digital  bookmarks  identifying  key  documents,  exhibits, 
and sections of the file as specified below Bookmarks should be labeled in 
a  manner  that  clearly  identifies  the  key  documents,  (for  example,  EEO 
Counselor’s  Report,  rather  than  generic  labels)  within  each  identified 
section.6

It  should  contain  a  typed  summary  of  the  investigation  signed  and  dated 
by  the  investigator  and  containing  a  discussion  and  analysis  of  the 
evidence.  See Section IX of this Chapter.

Agencies  should  organize  complaint  files  in  the  following  manner,  with  digital 
bookmarks specifically identifying the section and key documents therein. 

5  Except  for  Memorandums  of  Understandings  (MOUs)  currently  in  place  for  national  security 
purposes,  any  previous  information  from  the  Commission’s  offices  regarding  redactions,  upon  which 
agencies are relying to redact complaint files, is hereby obsolete. 

6 Where an agency has shown good cause as to why it cannot submit the complaint file in a digital 
format and received an exception letter to file a paper file , the agency should substitute the word “tab” 
for “section” in the below guidance.

The agency originating the equal employment opportunity case will retain 
the  original  (“official”)  file  during  the  appeals  process  and  send  only 
duplicate  copies  of  documents  to  the  Commission  for  use  in  the  appeal.  
The  agency  sending  the  duplicates  will  certify  that  the  file  contains 
everything that is in the original.  

The Commission will create documents relating to the appeal, but will file 
such  documents  apart  from  the  materials  sent  by  the  originating  agency.   
After  resolution  of the  appeal, the Commission will destroy  all duplicate 
materials,  but  will  retain  the  appeals  documentation  for  four  years.    The 
originating  agency  will  retain  the  original  file  for  four  years  after 
resolution  of  the  case.    The  Commission  will  retain  the  appeals 
documentation  and  will  answer  Freedom  of  Information  Act  requests  on 
the appeals file.  The Commission will maintain the security of documents 
as required by Federal Statutes and Executive Orders.  

The  originating  agency  will  be  responsible  for  retiring  the  original  case 
file to the Federal Records Center, and answering Freedom of Information 
Act  requests  on  the  original  file.    Requests  for  disclosure,  which  the 
Commission determines are requests for the agency’s complaint file, will 
be forwarded to the agency for a response.

IX.  THE INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY 

The  investigative summary is a narrative document that succinctly states the issues and 
delineates  the  evidence  addressing  both  sides  of  each  issue  in  the  case.    The  summary 
should  state facts  (supported in the complaint  file) sufficient  to  sustain  a  conclusion(s).  
The summary should cite to evidence and the exhibits collected.   

X. 

COMPLAINANTS= OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE INVESTIGATIVE 
FILE 

Within  the  appropriate  time  frame  for  finishing  an  investigation  under  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(e),  and  prior  to  issuance  of  the  notice  required  by  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.108(f), 
agencies  are  encouraged  to  allow  complainants  and  their  designated  representatives  an 
opportunity to examine the investigative file and to notify the agency, in writing, of any 
perceived  deficiencies  in  the  investigation  prior  to  transferring  the  case  to  the 
Commission for a hearing or prior to taking a final action without a hearing.  A copy of 
the complainant’s notification to the agency of perceived deficiencies must be included in 
the investigative file together with a written description by the agency of the corrective 
action taken.  

If  the  agency  agrees  with  alleged  deficiencies  in  the  investigation  as  identified  by  the 
complainant, the agency must immediately correct them.  If the investigation period has 
ended or is about to end, the agency should request agreement from the  complainant to 
extend the investigation period pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(e).  If the agency does 
not agree with the complainant’s claimed deficiencies in the investigative file, the agency 
will prepare a statement explaining the rationale for the disagreement and include it in the 
investigative file along with the complainant’s notice of claimed deficiencies.   

When  the  agency  affords  the  complainant  the  opportunity  to  review  the  draft  report  of 
investigation, it should also afford the agency representative the same option.

XI. 

SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO COOPERATE DURING THE 
INVESTIGATION 

Agencies and complainants each have a duty to cooperate with the investigator during the 
investigation.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(c)(1).  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(c)(3), a 
party to a complaint - the complainant as well as the agency - may be subject to sanctions 
where  it  fails  without  good  cause  shown  to  respond  fully  and  in  a  timely  fashion  to  a 
request of the investigator for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, 
or the attendance of witnesses.  The investigator shall make a note in the investigative file 
concerning  the  party’s  failure  without  good  cause  shown  to  comply  with  a  request  for 
information or the attendance of witnesses, and the decision maker (Administrative Judge 
during the hearing process or the agency where the complainant requests a final agency 
decision) or the Commission on appeal may, in appropriate circumstances: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the 
requested  witness,  would  have  reflected  unfavorably  on  the  party  refusing  to 
provide the requested information;  

consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to 
be established in favor of the opposing party;  

exclude  other  evidence  offered  by  the  party  failing  to  produce  the  requested 
information or witness;  

issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or  

take such other actions as it deems appropriate.  

An  investigator  should  inform  the  party  from  which  it  seeks  documents,  records, 
comparative  data,  statistics,  affidavits,  or  the  attendance  of  witnesses  that  failure  to 
comply with the request may lead to the imposition of sanctions from the decision maker 
or the Commission on appeal.  An investigator may, in an initial request for information 
or the attendance of witnesses, advise the party that, absent good cause shown, the party 
has a duty to respond fully and in a timely fashion to the investigator’s request and that 
failure  to  do  so  may  result  in  the  imposition  of  the  sanctions  set  forth  at  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(c)(3).  Where the investigator does not so inform the party upon making the 
request, s/he may advise the party upon the party’s failure to comply with the request.  If 
the investigator properly advised the party that a failure to comply with the request may 
result  in  the  sanctions  set  forth  at  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.108(c)(3),  the  decision  maker  or 
Commission  on  appeal  may  impose  such  sanctions  upon  receipt  and  review  of  the 
complaint/appeal file.

XII.  SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO DEVELOP AN IMPARTIAL AND 

APPROPRIATE FACTUAL RECORD 

Section  1614.108(b)  of  29  C.F.R.  requires  that  an  agency  develop  an  impartial  and 
appropriate  factual  record  upon  which  to  make  findings  on  the  claims  raised  in  the 
written  complaint.    The  Commission’s  regulations  explain  that  an  appropriate  factual 
record  is  one  that  allows  a  reasonable  fact  finder  to  draw  conclusions  as  to  whether 
discrimination occurred.”  29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(b).  The Commission’s Administrative 
Judges and the Office of Federal Operations have the authority to issue sanctions against 
an  agency  for  its  failure  to  develop  an  impartial  and  appropriate  factual  record  in 
appropriate circumstances.8

Where  it  is  clear  that  the  agency  failed  to  develop  an  impartial  and  appropriate  factual 
record,  an  Administrative  Judge  may  exercise  his/her  discretion  to  issue  sanctions.    In 
such circumstances, the sanctions listed in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3) are available.  See 
Petersel  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720060075 
(Oct.  30, 
2008)(Administrative Judge properly drew an adverse inference against the agency when 
the  investigative  report  failed  to  include  any  comparative  data  on  other  employees); 
Royal  v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans  Affairs,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720070045  (September  25, 
2009)(finding that the agency’s delay in completing the investigation within the 180-day 
regulatory period is no small noncompliance matter and warrants a sanction).  Even when 
an  agency  eventually  completes  the  investigation  during  the  hearing  stage  an 
Administrative Judge may issue sanctions in appropriate circumstances.9

Before  an  Administrative  Judge  may  sanction  an  agency  for  failing  to  develop  an 
impartial and appropriate factual record, the Administrative Judge must issue an order to 

8 The Commission recognizes that agencies will not always meet their regulatory burden to conduct 
such  comprehensive  investigations,  such  as  when  amendments  to  complaints  or  consolidation  of 
complaints  occur  late  in  the  process.    It  is  the  Commission’s  intent  that  where  a  hearing  is  properly 
requested and where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete or inadequate investigation, 
the record in the case shall be developed under the supervision of the Administrative Judge assigned to 
the case.    See, for example,  Menoken  v.  Social  Security  Administration,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01A32052 
(Jan. 3, 2005); but see also Cox v. Social Security Administration, EEOC Appeal No. 0720050055 (Dec. 
24, 2009) (finding that the purpose of discovery in the hearing process is to perfect the record, but it is not 
a  substitute  for  an  appropriate  investigation;  moreover,  not  every  complainant  chooses  the  option  of 
requesting a hearing).   

10 See Myvett v. Court Services & Offender Supervision Agency, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103671 
(Feb.  8,  2011),  request  for  reconsideration  denied,  EEOC  Request  No.  0520110349  (Nov.  21,  2011) 
(upholding Administrative Judge’s sanctions where agency submitted complaint file without a report of 
investigation and almost nine months later submitted a report of investigation to the Administrative Judge 
after failing to reply to two Orders to Complete the Investigation).

the agency or request  the documents, records,  comparative  data, statistics, or  affidavits.  
29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3).  Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions may be 
imposed  and  the  type  of  sanction  that  could  be  imposed  for  failure  to  comply  with  the 
order unless the agency can show good cause for that failure.  See Rountree v. Dep’t. of 
the Treasury, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001).  The notice to show cause to 
the agency may, in appropriate circumstances, provide the agency with an opportunity to 
take such action as the Administrative Judge deems necessary to correct the deficiencies 
in  the  record.    This  may  include  curing  the  defects  in  the  investigation  caused  by 
improper  interference by the agency’s  general  counsel, if possible;  and/or  disqualifying 
counsel  from  continuing  to  represent  the  agency  before  the  Commission.    The 
Administrative  Judge  also  shall  provide  the  agency  with  a  reasonable  period  of  time 
within  which  to  take  the  action  that  the  Administrative  Judge  has  deemed  necessary.   
Only  on  the  failure  of  the  agency  to  comply  with  the  Administrative  Judge’s  order  or 
request and the notice to show cause may the Administrative Judge impose a sanction or 
the sanctions identified in the order or request.10

XIII.   OFFER OF RESOLUTION 

The  Commission  encourages  the  resolution  of  complaints  at  all  times  in  the  complaint 
process through  a  variety  of  settlement mechanisms.   Section 1614.109(c)  of 29 C.F.R. 
provides  for  one  of  these  mechanisms  by  permitting  agencies  to  make  an  “offer  of 
resolution”  to  complainants.    The  Commission  believes  that  this  provision  will  provide 
incentive  for  agencies  and  complainants  to  resolve  complaints  and  that  it  will  conserve 
agency  resources  where  settlement  reasonably should occur.   If a  complainant  does not 
accept  an  offer  of  resolution  made  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(c)  and  subsequently  obtains  less  relief  than  had  been  offered,  the 
complainant’s  attorney’s  fees  will  be  limited,  as  described  below.    It  should  be 
emphasized that the offer of resolution is only one mechanism by which complaints may 
be settled. 

A. 

Elements of the Offer 

An  offer  of  resolution  made  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109(c)  can  be  made  to  a 
complainant  who  is  represented  by  an  attorney  at  any  time  after  the  filing  of  a  formal 

10  Where  an  agency  did  not  complete  an  investigation  of  late-filed  amendments  to  complaints  or 
late-consolidated  complaints  because  the  complainant  either  requested  a  hearing  before  the  full 
investigatory period ended or the amendments and consolidation occurred late in the process, sanctions 
for  inadequate  records  would  be  inappropriate.    Sanctions  only  would  be  appropriate  where  a  party 
subsequently fails to comply with an order or request of the Administrative Judge that puts the party on 
notice of the type of sanction that may be imposed for noncompliance.

complaint  until  thirty  (30)  days  before  a  hearing.    If,  however,  the  complainant  is  not 
represented  by  an  attorney,  an  offer  of  resolution  cannot  be  made  before  the  case  is 
assigned  to  an  Administrative  Judge  for  a  hearing.    (These  time  and  representation 
provisions  apply  only  to  offers  of  resolution  and  do  not  restrict  the  parties  from 
discussing settlement or engaging in an alternate dispute resolution process in an effort to 
resolve an EEO complaint.) 

Complainants  have  30  days  from  receipt  of  an  offer  of  resolution  to  consider  the  offer 
and decide whether to accept it.  Offers of resolution must be in writing and must explain 
to the complainant the possible consequences of failing to accept the offer.  The agency’s 
offer, to be acceptable, must include attorney’s fees and costs, and must specify any non-
monetary  relief.  The agency may offer a  lump  sum  payment that includes all forms of 
monetary  liability,  including  attorney’s  fees  and  costs,  or  the  payment  may  itemize  the 
amounts  and  types  of  monetary  relief  being  offered.    Complainant’s  acceptance  of  the 
offer  must  also  be  in  writing.    Upon  acceptance,  the  complaint  is  settled  in  full  and 
processing ceases.  

If a complainant decides not to  accept the offer,  the agency takes no  immediate  action, 
and the complaint continues to be processed normally.  After the hearing is completed, if 
the  Administrative  Judge  (or  the  Commission  on  appeal)  concludes  that  discrimination 
has occurred, but provides for less relief than the amount offered by the agency earlier in 
its offer of resolution, then the agency may use complainant’s decision not to accept its 
offer  of  resolution  to  argue  for  a  reduction  in  its  obligation  to  pay  complainant’s 
attorney’s fees.  In general, if a complainant fails to accept a properly made offer, and the 
relief ordered on the complaint is not more favorable than the offer, then the complainant 
will not receive payment  from the agency  for  attorney’s fees  or costs  incurred  after the 
expiration of the 30-day acceptance period.  

It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  an  exception  to  this  general  rule  exists  where  the 
interests  of  justice  would  not  be  served.    An  example  of  an  appropriate  use  of  the 
interests of justice exception is where the complainant received an offer of resolution, but 
was informed by a responsible agency official that the agency would not comply in good 
faith with the offer (for example, would unreasonably delay implementation of the relief 
offered).    If the complainant  did not accept  the  offer  for that reason, and  then  obtained 
less relief than was obtained in the offer, it would be unjust to deny attorney’s fees and 
costs.  

A  complainant’s  failure  to  accept  an  offer  of  resolution  does  not  preclude  the  agency 
from  making  other  offers  of  resolution  or  either  party  from  seeking  to  negotiate  a 
settlement of the complaint at any time.  

When comparing the relief offered in  an  offer  of resolution  with that actually obtained, 
the  Commission  intends  that  non-monetary  as  well  as  monetary  relief  be  considered.

6-29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

Although  a  comparison  of  non-monetary  relief  may  be  inexact  and  difficult  in  some 
cases, non-monetary relief can be significant and cannot be overlooked.  Attorney’s fees 
and costs incurred after the offer of resolution may not be included in the amount actually 
obtained for comparison purposes.  For guidance, parties may wish to refer to court cases 
deciding issues involving an offer of judgment made pursuant to Rule 68 of the Federal 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.    See,  for  example,  Marek  v.  Chesney,  473  U.S.  1  (1985).   
While not identical, the Commission’s offer of resolution provision was modeled on the 
Rule 68 offer of judgment process.   

B.  Model Language for the Offer 

The  preamble  to  the  Commission’s  regulations  noted  that  this  Management  Directive 
would include model language for agency use in extending offers of resolutions: 

This offer of resolution is made in full satisfaction of the claims of 
employment  discrimination  that  you  have  made  against  [name  of 
agency]  in  [identify  the  complaint  by  number  or  other  clear  and

and/or  non-monetary  relief  to  which  you  are  entitled,  including 
attorney’s fees and costs. 

[For complainants who are not represented by counsel include this

CHAPTER 7  
HEARINGS 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

The hearing is an adjudicatory proceeding that completes the process of developing a full 
and  appropriate  record.    A  hearing  provides  the  parties  with  a  fair  and  reasonable 
opportunity  to  explain  and  supplement  the  record  and,  in  appropriate  instances,  to 
examine and cross-examine witnesses.  Hearings are governed by 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109.1
An Administrative Judge from the Commission adjudicates claims of discrimination and 
issues decisions.  Unless the agency issues a final order within forty (40) days of receipt 
of  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  in  a  non-class  action  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.110(a),  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  becomes  the  final  action  of  the 
agency.  A complainant may appeal an agency’s final action or dismissal of a complaint.  
An  agency  may  appeal  as  provided 
  29 C.F.R. 
§§ 1614.401(a) & (b). 

in  29 C.F.R.  §  1614.110(a). 

Section 1614.108(f) of 29 C.F.R. generally provides, among other things, that within 180 
days  from  the  complainant’s  filing  of  his/her  complaint,  an  agency  shall  provide  the 
complainant  with  a  copy  of  the  investigative  file  and  shall  notify  the  complainant  that 
within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  complainant’s  receipt  of  the  investigative  file  that  the 
complainant has the right to request a hearing and decision from an Administrative Judge 
or a final agency decision from the agency.2
  Regardless of whether the investigation is 
complete, the agency’s duty to send this notice and the complainant’s right to receive it 
are not dependent on the agency’s completion of the investigation. 

If  the  agency  does  not  send  the  notice  required  in  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.108(f)  within  the 
applicable time limits, it must send a notice informing the complainant that it has not yet 
finished the investigation and providing an estimate as to when the investigation will be 
completed.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(g).  The notice should notify the complainant that 
they do not have to wait for the investigation to be completed and may request a hearing 
or file a civil action in an appropriate U.S. District Court.  Further, the notice will contain 
information regarding the hearing process. 

1 Additional information regarding hearings and the hearing process can be found in the U.S. Equal 

Opportunity Commission’s Handbook for Administrative Judges, July 1, 2002.  

2  Section  1614.108(f)  of  29  C.F.R.  specifically  provides  that  the  agency  has  a  duty  to  send  the 
notice within 180 days of the filing of the complaint or, where a complaint has been amended, the earlier 
of  180  days  from  the  date  of  the  last  amendment  or  360  days  from  the  filing  of  the  first  complaint, 
whichever is earlier; within a time period set forth in an order from the Commission; or within any period 
of extension provided under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(e).

A complainant must submit the hearing request directly  to the Commission’s district or 
field office having jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the complaint arose, as 
set forth in Appendix N of this Management Directive, and provide a copy of the request 
to the agency.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(h).  (The Commission has prepared a hearing 
request  form  that  agencies  may  provide  to  complainants  for  their  use  in  requesting  a 
hearing,  which  advises  complainants  that  they  are  to  send  a  copy  of  the  request  to  the 
agency.  See Appendix M.)  Upon receipt of the request for a hearing, the Commission’s 
district  or  field  office  will  assign  the  case  to  an  Administrative  Judge  who  will  issue 
Orders/Notices  as  appropriate  to  the  case  and  provide  the  parties  with  a  Commission 
Hearings  Unit  No.  or  docket  number,  and  if  the  agency  did  not  receive  a  copy  of  the 
complainant’s  request  for  a  hearing,  will  require  that  the  agency  forward  a  copy  of  the 
complaint file within fifteen (15) days. 

In an agency’s written acknowledgment of receipt of a complaint or an amendment to a 
complaint,  the  agency  shall  advise  the  complainant  of  the  Commission’s  office  and 
address  where a  hearing  request is to be sent as  well  as the  agency office to which the 
copy of the request should be sent.  In the absence of the required notice from the agency, 
the complainant may request a hearing at any time after 180 days have elapsed from the 
filing  of  the  complaint  by  submitting  his/her  written  hearing  request  directly  to  the 
appropriate Commission district or field office indicated in the agency’s acknowledgment 
letter.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.108(h).  In the case of accepted class complaints, a Commission 
Administrative Judge will, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(h), conduct a hearing on the 
complaint in accordance with 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.109(a) - (f). 

Generally, an Administrative Judge will conduct a hearing on the merits of a complaint 
unless:  1)  the  parties  mutually  resolve  the  complaint  and  the  hearing  request  is 
withdrawn;  2)  the  hearing  request  is  otherwise  voluntarily  withdrawn;  3)  the 
Administrative Judge dismisses the complaint; or 4) the Administrative Judge determines 
that material facts are not in genuine dispute and issues an order limiting the scope of the 
hearing or issues a decision without a hearing pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(g).  The 
Administrative  Judge  will  issue  a  decision  on  a  complaint  and  shall  order  appropriate 
remedies  and  relief  when  discrimination  has  been  found  within  180  days  of  his/her 
receipt of the complaint  file  from  the  agency, unless the Administrative Judge  makes a 
written determination that, in his/her discretion, good cause exists for extending the time 
for issuing a decision.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(i).3

3  A  decision  issued  within  180  days  may  include  a  finding  of  discrimination,  an  order  that  the 
agency provide relief, and pay the complainant’s attorney’s fees.  The Administrative Judge then would 
issue a second decision subsequent to the end of this 180-day period concerning the quantum of relief and 
attorney’s fees.  In this situation, the agency’s 40-day period for taking final action on the Administrative 
Judge’s  decision  and  determining  whether  it  will  implement  the  decision  begins  on  its  receipt  of  the 
second decision and the hearing file.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.110(a).

II. 

THE ROLE OF THE AGENCY AT THE HEARING STAGE 

A. 

Forward Complaint File to the Commission 

Within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of a copy of the complainant’s request for a 
hearing sent to a Commission district or field office, the agency shall send a copy 
of the complaint file, including the investigative file, to the district or field office.  
The agency also shall send a copy of the complaint and investigative file(s) to the 
complainant  and  his/her  representative,  if  it  has  not  previously  done  so.    The 
complaint file sent to the complainant or his/her representative must be identical 
to the complaint file sent to the Commission’s district or field office.  See Chapter 
6, Section VIII of this directive for more information regarding the complaint file.  
The complainant and his/her representative shall be given the option of receiving 
these documents in paper or digital format. 

B. 

Hearing Room and Production of Witnesses 

The agency is responsible for arranging for an appropriately sized room in which 
to hold the hearing and must ensure that all approved witnesses who are federal 
employees  are  notified  of  the  date  and  time  of  the  hearing  and  the  approximate 
time  that  their  presence  will  be  required.    This  includes  making  space  available 
with  appropriate  virtual  conferencing  equipment  for  hearings  and/or  other 
proceedings as required by the Administrative Judge.  The agency is responsible 
for  ensuring  the  appearance  and  travel  arrangements  to  the  hearing  site  of 
approved  witnesses who are federal employees.   Note: the Administrative Judge 
may  order  the  agency  to  provide  any  reasonable  accommodations  for  parties, 
witnesses,  or  representatives  appearing  before  the  Commission  as  well  as  any 
required foreign language interpreters. 

C. 

Hearings Are Closed to the Public 

Access  to  the  hearing  room  and  the  record  of  the  hearing  shall  be  restricted  in 
accordance with the Commission’s regulation.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(e).  

D. 

Verbatim Hearing Transcripts and Court Reporters 

The agency shall arrange and pay for a verbatim transcript (provided in electronic 
format  for  the  Administrative  Judge  and  the  complainant,  unless  otherwise 
requested)  of  the  hearing  proceedings  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109(h) 

Management Directive 
7-3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110 

August, 2015 

regardless  of  whether  the  Administrative  Judge  issues  a  decision.    All  exhibits 
submitted to the Administrative Judge and admitted into evidence shall become a 
part of the complaint file and at the discretion of the Administrative Judge may be 
referred  to  the  court  reporter  to  be  appended  to  the  transcript.    Agencies  should 
instruct  reporters  with  whom  they  contract  to  submit  bills  to  the  agency.    The 
Administrative Judge may require the court reporter to submit the original and all 
copies  (usually  two)  of  the  transcript  to  the  Administrative  Judge,  who  can 
provide verification of transcript receipt and the number of pages in the transcript.  
Contracts with court reporting firms must require delivery of the transcript to the 
Administrative  Judge  within  a  customary  time  frame  determined  by  the  court 
reporting firm within the jurisdiction, not to exceed twenty-one (21) days unless 
the Administrative Judge requires delivery of the transcript by a certain date after 
the  close  of  the  hearing.    If  the  Administrative  Judge  identifies  a  problem  with 
timely  delivery  of  the  transcript  or  any  other  difficulty,  s/he  should  contact  the 
agency directly to resolve the dispute.  The agency shall take any steps necessary 
to  ensure  that  the  transcript  is  provided  as  expeditiously  as  possible.    Absent  a 
specific  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Commission,  the  agency  may 
not use employees of that agency to transcribe the proceedings.   

As a matter of information, the General Services Administration maintains a list 
of court reporters available to agencies in the GSA eLibrary. 

E. 

The Site of the Hearing 

Appendix  N  of  the  Management  Directive  is  a  list  of  the  addresses  of  the 
Commission  district  and  field  offices,  their  geographic  jurisdictions,  and  where 
federal employees and applicants should send hearing requests.  Hearing requests 
are sent to the district office having jurisdiction over the agency facility where the 
complaint  arose.    In  an  agency’s  written  acknowledgment  of  a  complaint  or  an 
amendment  to  a  complaint,  the  agency  must  advise  the  complainant  of  the 
Commission  office  and  its  address  where  a  request  for  a  hearing  shall  be  sent.   
Where  two  or  more  complaints  have  been  consolidated  and  the  Commission 
district or field offices identified in the agency’s complaint acknowledgment letter 
differ, the office identified in the last filed complaint will govern the location of 
the  office  to  which  the  hearing  request  shall  be  made.    Should  the  agency’s 
organizational  component  where  the  complaint  arose  not  fall  within  one  of  the 
geographical  jurisdictions  shown  in  Appendix  N,  the  agency  should  contact  the 
following office for guidance:

Upon receipt of a hearing request, the Administrative Judge assigned to hear the 
complaint  will  determine  the  site  of  the  hearing.    Within  his/her  discretion,  the 
Administrative  Judge  is  authorized  to  conduct  the  hearing  in  the  Commission 
district  or  field  office,  in  a  Commission  area  or  local  office,  at  the  agency’s 
organizational component where the complaint arose or at such other location or 
by virtual conference as s/he may determine appropriate within a local commuting 
distance from the agency’s component unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  
In determining the hearing site, the Administrative Judge should consider factors 
such as the location of the parties; the location of the Commission district, area, 
and  local  offices;  the  number and  location of  witnesses;  the location  of records; 
travel  distances  for  the  Administrative  Judge,  the  parties,  and  witnesses;  travel 
costs;  the  availability  of  sources  of  transportation;  and  other  factors  as  may  be 
the  availability  of  appropriate  virtual  conferencing 
appropriate 
equipment. 

including 

Similarly,  where  an  Administrative  Judge  is  considering  whether  the  hearing 
should be held by video conferencing, there are a number of factors that should be 
considered before electing to proceed.  These factors include the availability and 
proximity to the participants of the video-conferencing facilities;4
 the adequacy of 
the available video-conferencing facilities, including any technological issues; the 
cost to the respondent agency (if any) balanced against the savings in travel time 
for all parties and the Administrative Judge; the number of expected participants; 
and the objections of the parties, if any.  Should a party object to conducting the 
hearing  by  video  conference,  the  Administrative  Judge  will  document  for  the 
record  both  the  nature  of  the  objection  and  his/her  ruling  on  the  objection, 

4 “Proximity” in this instance refers to whether the facility is within reasonable commuting distance 
for  the  hearing  participants.    The  Commission  notes,  however,  that  considerations  of  proximity  will 
generally exclude the use of video conferencing when all participants and the Administrative Judge are 
located within commuting distance of an appropriate location for an in-person hearing.  But cf.

If  the Administrative  Judge  sets  a hearing by video  conference or a  hearing site 
that is outside the local commuting area of the agency’s organizational component 
where  the  complaint  arose,  the  agency  must  bear  all  reasonable  video-
conferencing  costs  if  any,  or  travel  expenses  of  complainants,  their  authorized 
representatives,  agency  representatives,  and  all  witnesses  approved  by  the

F. 

Request for Change in Venue 

Should either party desire that a hearing be held within the jurisdictional area of 
another  Commission  district  office,  it  must  submit  a  request,  in  writing,  to  the 
other party and to the Administrative Judge assigned to the case in the appropriate 
Commission  district  or  field  office  having  jurisdiction  over  the  agency’s 
organizational  component  where  the  complaint  arose.    In  its  request,  the  party 
must set out, in detail, its reasons and justification for the requested change.  The 
other  party  may  have  an  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  change  in  venue.    The 
Administrative  Judge  will  rule  on  the  request  only  after  the  directors  of  the 
concerned  Commission  district  offices  or  their  designees  have  conferred  on  the 
matter. 

G. 

Agency Costs 

The  agency’s  obligation  is  limited  to  those  costs  that  are  legally  payable  in 
advance  by  the  agency.    See  Expenses  of  Outside  Applicant/Complainant  to 
Travel to Agency EEO Hearing, File: B-202845, 61 Comp. Gen. 654 (1982).  See 
also  John  Booth--Travel  Expenses  of  Witness  --  Agency  Responsible,  File:  B-
235845, 69 Comp. Gen. 310 (1990).  

5 In this regard, the Commission contemplates that the Administrative Judge will provide the parties 
advance notice of his/her intention to proceed by video conference, allowing opportunity for the parties to 
object prior to the time the hearing is convened.  Objections to video conference raised on appeal will be 
reviewed  by  the  Commission  under  the  abuse  of  discretion  standard,  on  a  case-by-case  basis.    See

III.  THE ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE 

Once  an  Administrative  Judge  is  appointed,  the  Administrative  Judge  has  full 
responsibility  for  the  adjudication  of  the  complaint.    29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109(a).    The 
agency  cannot  dismiss  a  case  that  has  been  referred  to  the  Commission  for  a  hearing.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a). 

A. 

Administrative Judge’s Review of the Record 

An  Administrative  Judge  shall  review  the  record  developed  by  the  agency  and 
determine  whether  additional  documentation  is  necessary.    If  a  determination  is 
made  that  additional  documentation  is  necessary,  the  Administrative  Judge  may 
order the appropriate party to produce the additional documentation.   

If  after  reviewing  the  file,  the  Administrative  Judge  determines  that  the 
investigation  is  inadequate  due  to  the  agency’s  failure  to  complete  the 
investigation  within  the  time  limits  set  forth  in  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.108(e),  or  the 
agency  has  not  cooperated  in  the  discovery  process  as  required  by  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(f)(3), the Administrative Judge may take the following actions: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Subject  the  agency  to  adverse  inference  findings  in  favor  of  the 
complainant; 

Consider  the  issues  to  which  the  requested  information  or  testimony 
pertains to be favorable to the complainant; 

Exclude other evidence offered by the agency; 

Permit  the  complainant  to  obtain  a  summary  disposition  in  his/her  favor 
(that is, default judgment) on some or all of the issues without a hearing; 
or 

Take  other  action  deemed  appropriate,  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
requiring  the  agency  to  pay  any  costs  incurred  by  the  complainant  in 
taking depositions or in conducting any other form of discovery. 

The Commission has the authority to issue sanctions in the administrative hearing 
process because it was granted, through statute, the power to issue such rules and 
regulations  that  it  deems  necessary  to  enforce  the  prohibition  on  employment 
discrimination.    See  Waller  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0720030069 (May 25, 2007), request for reconsideration denied, EEOC Request 
No. 0520070689 (Feb. 26, 2009).  In this respect, the Commission has determined 
“that  delegating  to  its  Administrative  Judges  the  authority  to  issue  sanctions 

Management Directive 
7-7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110 

August, 2015 

against  agencies,  and  complainants,  is  necessary  and  is  an  appropriate  remedy 
which effectuates the policies of the Commission.”  Id. 

However,  before  an Administrative Judge  may  sanction  an agency  for  failing to 
develop an impartial and appropriate factual record or for not cooperating in the 
discovery process, the Administrative Judge must issue an order to the agency or 
request  the  documents,  records,  comparative  data,  statistics,  or  affidavits.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3).  Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions 
may  be  imposed  and  the  type  of  sanction  that  could  be  imposed  for  failure  to 
comply  with  the  order  unless  the  agency  can  show  good  cause  for  that  failure.   
See Rountree v. Dep’t. of the Treasury,  Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 17, 2001).  
In appropriate circumstances, the order or request may provide the agency with an 
opportunity  to  take  such  action  as  the  Administrative  Judge  deems  necessary  to 
correct the deficiencies in the record within a specified reasonable period of time.  
Only on the failure of the agency to comply with the Administrative Judge’s order 
or request and the notice to show cause may the Administrative Judge impose a 
sanction or the sanctions identified in the order or request. 

B. 

Developing the Record in Complaints with Inadequate Records 

Section  1614.108(h)  of  29  C.F.R.  authorizes  a  complainant  to  request  a  hearing 
before  an  Administrative Judge where  the  respondent agency  has  not  completed 
the investigation within the required time limit and where the complainant has not 
agreed  in  writing  with  the  agency  to  extend  the  time  for  completing  the 
investigation.6
  This provision reflects the Commission’s intent that complainants 
be  permitted  to  move  their  cases  forward  in  the  complaint  process  where  an 
agency has not complied with the regulation by completing a timely investigation.  
Further, it is the Commission’s intent that where a hearing is properly requested 
and where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete or inadequate 
investigation,  the record in the case shall  be  developed under the  supervision of 
the  Administrative  Judge  assigned  to  the  case.    The  record  can  be  developed 
through  the  parties’  use  of  discovery  and/or  through  the  Administrative  Judge’s 
orders for the production of documents and witnesses. 

6  Where  an  agency  did  not  complete  an  investigation  of  late-filed  amendments  to  complaints  or 
late-consolidated  complaints  because  the  complainant  either  requested  a  hearing  before  the  full 
investigatory period ended or the amendments and consolidation occurred late in the process, sanctions 
for  inadequate  records  would  be  inappropriate.    Sanctions  only  would  be  appropriate  where  a  party 
subsequently fails to comply with an order or request of the Administrative Judge that puts the party on 
notice of the type of sanction that may be imposed for noncompliance.

that  upon  appointment, 

Section  1614.109(a)  of  29  C.F.R.  provides 
the 
Administrative  Judge  will  assume  full  responsibility  for  adjudication  of  the 
complaint, including overseeing the development of the record.  The Commission 
intends that the Administrative Judge will take complete control of the case once 
a  hearing  is  requested.    Administrative  Judges  will  preside  over  any  necessary 
supplementation of the record in the hearing process without resort to remands of 
complaints to  agencies for additional investigations.    If an Administrative Judge 
determines  that  there  is  an  incomplete  or  inadequate  investigation,  s/he  may, 
however, issue an order directing the agency to complete its investigation within a 
specified  period  of  time  set  forth  in  the  order  or  directing  that  the  agency  show 
cause for its failure to complete the investigation within the 180-day period.   

Where  an  agency  has  not  completed  a  timely  investigation  or  has  prepared  an 
inadequate investigation, the Administrative Judge may issue an order on his/her 
own  initiative  or  upon  request  by  either  party  requiring  a  party  to  produce 
documents,  records,  comparative  data,  statistics,  or  the  attendance  of  witnesses.   
Such order or request shall make clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type 
of sanction that could be imposed for failure to comply with the order within the 
specified  time  set  forth  in  the  order  without  good  cause  shown.  7
    See,  for 
example, 
, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 
17, 2001).  Where the agency or complainant fails without good cause shown to 
respond fully and in a timely fashion to the Administrative Judge’s order and/or 
the  party  has  not  otherwise  cooperated

Judge  may

Administrative Judge intends to impose, the Administrative Judge must issue a separate notice to show

opportunity  to cure  the  noncompliance  before imposing  the  sanction.   This rule  applies  in  all instances 
where the Administrative Judge intends to impose a sanction on a party for a failure to comply with an 
order or request that does not make clear what sanction(s) may be imposed for noncompliance.

result  of  a  discovery  order  issued  pursuant  to  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.109(f)(3)(v), 
require the agency to bear the costs for the complainant to obtain depositions or 
any  other  discovery  because  the  agency  has  failed  to  complete  its  investigation 
timely  as  required  by  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.108(e)  or  has  failed  to  investigate  the 
allegations adequately pursuant to Chapter 6 of this Management Directive.9
  See 
also Section IV.F of this Chapter. 

If  either  party  is  requested  by  the  Administrative  Judge  to  produce  additional 
documents,  that  party  shall  also  furnish  a  copy  of  those  documents  to  the 
opposing party at the time they are submitted to the Administrative Judge.  

C. 

Dismissal of Complaint by Administrative Judge 

The  Administrative  Judge  may  dismiss  complaints  within  his/her  jurisdiction 
pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a) on his/her own initiative, after notice to the 
parties,  or  upon  an  agency’s  motion  to  dismiss  a  complaint.    (See  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(b) and Chapter 5, Section IV of this Management Directive.)  Before 
dismissing a complaint, the Administrative Judge must ensure that the claim has 
not  been  fragmented  inappropriately  into  more  than  one  complaint.    A  series  of 
subsequent events or instances involving the same claim should not be treated as 
separate complaints, but should be added to and treated as part of the first claim.  
See  Chapter  5,  Section  III  of  this  Management  Directive  for  an  extended 
discussion on fragmentation. 

D. 

Administrative Judge’s Authority 

The  Administrative  Judge  has  full  responsibility  for  the  adjudication  of  the 
complaint, which includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

1. 

Issue decisions on complaints. 

respond  to  the  Administrative  Judge’s  Order  to  Show  Cause  why  a  default  judgment  should  not  be 
entered against the agency). 

9  See  for  example,  Waller  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720030069  (May  25, 
2007),  (finding  that  Administrative  Judges  may  award  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  as  a  sanction  against 
federal agencies for the violation of an Administrative Judge’s Order and that awarding attorney’s fees 
and costs as a sanction ensures the integrity and efficiency of the administrative process).

fails  to  comply  without  good  cause  with  orders  or  requests.    See  29 C.F.R.  § 
1614.109(f)(3).    In  addition,  the  Administrative  Judge  may  impose  sanctions 
where  a  party  fails  to  appear  or  be  prepared  for  a  conference  (for  example,  for 
status  or  settlement  discussions)  or  hearing  pursuant  to  an  order  of  the

of witnesses:   

At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the 
testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion.  This rule does 
not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of 
a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a 
person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party’s

imposed  for  failure  to  comply  with  orders  to  compel,  requests  for  information, 
documents,  or  admissions  where  the  information  is  solely  in  the  control  of  that 
party.13    Similarly,  if  a  party  fails  to  provide  an  adequate  explanation  for  the 
failure to respond fully and in a timely manner to a request and the information is 
solely  in  the  control  of  that  party,  the  Administrative  Judge  may  impose 
sanctions.14
  Sanctions for failing to comply with the orders or requests discussed 
above include, but are not limited to, the authority to:  

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

draw  an  adverse  inference  that  the  requested  information  would 
have  reflected  unfavorably  on  the  party  refusing  to  provide  the 
requested information;  

consider the issues to which the requested information pertains to 
be established in favor of the opposing party; 

exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the 
requested information;  

enter  a  decision  fully  or  partially  in  favor  of  the  opposing  party; 
and 

(e) 

take such other actions as appropriate.15

2010)(OFO  affirmed  the  Administrative  Judge’s  dismissal  of  complainant’s  request  for  a  hearing  as  a 
sanction for her failure to prosecute her case when she failed to timely submit a previously ordered Pre-
Hearing Statement or otherwise proceed with her complaint). 

12 See also LeBlanc v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01981419 (May 5, 1999)(upholding

sanction for the failure to respond to discovery requests). 

14 See for example, Johnson, (OFO upheld the Administrative Judge’s dismissal of complainant’s 
hearing request, stating that when the complainant responded to the Administrative Judge’s order to show 
cause, he did not explain his failure to respond to discovery as he was ordered to do, but instead argued 
the merits of his case).

Calculate compensatory damage awards. 

Before  holding  a  hearing,  the  Administrative  Judge  may  require  the 
complainant,  after  receipt  of  an  agency  motion  or  otherwise,  to  declare 
whether  or  not  s/he  is  seeking  compensatory  damages  as  relief  for  the 
discrimination  or  retaliation  alleged  in  the  complaint,  and  to  proffer  or 
produce evidence demonstrating entitlement to compensatory damages.  If 
a  complainant

Administrative  Judge  may,  in  his/her  discretion,  deem  the  claim  for 
damages to be waived.

Where the complainant has claimed compensatory damages and where the 
Administrative  Judge  determines,  on  the  merits  of  the  complaint, 
intentional 
entitlement 
discrimination  or  retaliation,  the  Administrative  Judge  will  calculate  the 
amount  of  compensatory  damages  to  be  awarded  by  the  respondent 
agency.    In  complaints  where  compensatory  damages  have  been  claimed 
and a hearing is held, the Administrative Judge may, in his/her discretion, 
develop the record on the compensatory damages claim during the hearing 
on  the  merits  of  the  complaint  or  may  bifurcate  the  proceeding  and 
develop the record on the compensatory damages claim after a finding of 
discrimination.  

12. 

Order a medical examination.  

Administrative  Judges  have  the  authority  to  order,  in  very  limited 
circumstances,  as  detailed  below,  that  a  complainant  undergo  a  medical 
examination  on  motion  of  the  agency.    A  request  by  the  agency  that  a 
complainant undergo a medical examination must notify the complainant, 
the  complainant’s  representative,  and  the  Administrative  Judge,  of  the 
proposed  time,  place,  manner,  conditions,  and  scope  of  the  examination 
and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.  The Administrative 
Judge must approve all such requests.   

In making a determination of whether to order a medical examination, an 
Administrative  Judge  may  be  guided  by  the  principles  and  cases  arising 
under  Rule  35  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  governing  the 
physical  and  mental  examinations  of  persons.    The  burden  of  proof  in 

upheld the Administrative Judge’s dismissal of the complainant’s hearing request even when an order to 
show  cause  had  not  been  issued,  pointing  out  that  when  the  Administrative  Judge  issued  the 
Acknowledgement and Order it advised the parties that failure to follow Orders may result in sanctions 
pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3).

supporting  a  request  for  such  an  examination  requires  an  affirmative 
showing  that  each  condition  as  to  which  examination  is  sought  is 
genuinely  in  controversy  and  that  good  cause  exists  for  ordering  each 
particular examination.  Such requests must be narrowly tailored to elicit 
only  the  evidence  necessary  to  develop  the  record  with  regard  to  the 
specific issue.  

The agency requesting the examination has the burden of proving that the 
examination  is  reasonably  necessary.    For  example,  merely  showing  that 
the  complainant  has  made  a  claim  for  compensatory  damages  is  not 
sufficient to  meet  the agency’s burden of proof.   In determining whether 
such  a  request  is  reasonable,  the  Administrative  Judge  will  consider: 
whether  the complainant has asserted  a  claim  for compensatory damages 
sufficient to place his/her mental or physical condition in controversy; and 
whether  the  request  is  made  for  good  cause  shown,  that  is,  that  the 
examination is reasonably necessary to determine the existence and extent 
of  an  asserted  injury.    The  Commission  has  held  that  evidence  from  a 
health  care  professional  is  not  a  mandatory  prerequisite  to  establishing 
entitlement  to  compensatory  damages.    Sinnott  v.  Dep’t.  of  Defense, 
EEOC  Appeal  No.  01952872  (September  19,  1996);  Lawrence  v.  U.S. 
Postal Service,  EEOC Appeal No. 01952288  (1996); Carpenter v.  Dep’t. 
of  Agriculture,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01945652  (July  17,  1995).    A 
complainant’s own testimony, along with the circumstances of a particular 
case,  may  suffice  to  sustain  the  complainant’s  burden  in  this  regard.  
Therefore,  independent  medical  examinations  will  not  be  appropriate  in 
every  case  in  which  a  claim  for  compensatory  damages  is  made.    See 
“Requests  for Private  Information Should  Be  Limited” at Section  IV.B.4 
in this Chapter of this Management Directive for more information. 

Some  factors  to  be  considered  in  determining  whether  an  agency  has 
shown  that  a  complainant  has  asserted  a  claim  for  damages  sufficient  to 
place  his/her  mental  or  physical  condition  in  controversy  include:  1)  the 
type and extent of mental or physical harm claimed; 2) whether the harm 
alleged is ongoing or is merely a past harm with no current effects on the 
complainant;  3)  whether  the  complainant  has  offered  expert  testimony 
concerning the nature and/or extent of the alleged harm or intends to offer 
such testimony; and 4) whether the complainant has sufficiently asserted a 
connection  between  the  asserted  harm  and  the  alleged  discrimination 
sufficient  to  establish  a  causal  relationship  between  the  harm  and  the 
alleged discrimination.  

Some  factors  to  be  considered  in  determining  whether  an  agency 
requesting  a  mental  or  physical  examination  has  shown  good  cause  for 

Management Directive 
7-14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

EEO MD-110 

such  examination  include:  1) the nature  and  severity of the alleged  harm 
and  the  likelihood  that  the  requested  examination  will  elicit  relevant 
evidence as to the existence and/or extent of the alleged harm; 2) whether 
there is already sufficient evidence in the record as to the nature and extent 
of  the  asserted  harm;  and  3)  whether  the  information  sought  could  be 
obtained  through  other  less  intrusive  discovery  techniques,  such  as 
interrogatories, depositions, or requests for the production of witnesses or 
documents.  

Even  where  the  above  criteria  may  have  been  satisfied  by  the  agency 
requesting the examination, the decision to order such examination at the 
hearing stage is solely within the discretion of the Administrative Judge. 

Upon receipt of a request from the agency for a medical examination, the 
complainant may file a motion for a protective order, stating objections to 
the request or order.  See Section IV.D.2.b of this Chapter.  The decision 
to  order  such  examination  at  the  hearing  stage  remains  solely  within  the 
discretion of the Administrative Judge. 

13. 

Calculate and award the amount of attorney’s fees or costs.  

Where  a  party  is  represented  by  an  attorney,  an  Administrative  Judge  is 
authorized  to  award  a  complainant  reasonable  attorney’s  fees  and  costs 
(including  expert  witness  fees)  incurred  in  the  processing  of  a  complaint 
where the Administrative Judge issues a decision finding discrimination in 
violation  of  Title  VII  and/or  the  Rehabilitation  Act,  the  Administrative 
Judge  issues  an  order  sanctioning  the  agency,  or  where  the  award  of 
attorney’s fees or costs may otherwise be appropriate and authorized.  Any 
award of attorney’s fees or costs shall be paid by the respondent agency.  
Where the Administrative Judge determines that a complainant is entitled 
to  an  award  of  attorney’s  fees  or  costs,  the  Administrative  Judge  will 
calculate  the  amount  of  such  award  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B) and Chapter 11 of this Management Directive.   

When  the  Administrative  Judge  determines  an  entitlement  to  attorney’s 
fees or costs, the complainant’s attorney must submit a verified statement 
of  attorney’s  fees  (including  expert  witness  fees)  and  other  costs,  as 
appropriate, to the Administrative Judge within thirty (30) days of receipt 
of the decision, unless otherwise directed, and must submit a copy of the 
statement to the agency.  A statement of attorney’s fees and costs must be 
accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing 
the  attorney’s  charges  for  legal  services.    The  agency  may  respond  to  a 
statement of attorney’s fees and costs within thirty (30) days of its receipt.

The verified statement, accompanying affidavit, and any agency response 
shall be made a part of the complaint file.  The Administrative Judge will 
issue a decision  determining  the  amount of  attorney’s  fees  and costs due 
within sixty (60) days of receipt of the statement and affidavit. 

14.  

Engage  the  parties  or  encourage  the  parties  to  engage  in  settlement 
discussions. 

The  Administrative  Judge  may  engage  the  parties  in  discussion  aimed  at 
reaching a settlement agreement or may allow the parties such time as they 
may  need  to  discuss  settlement.    The  Administrative  Judge  further  may 
hold  a  hearing  in  abeyance  to  allow  the  parties  to  engage  in  alternate 
forms of dispute resolution.  (For a more detailed discussion of alternative 
dispute resolution, see Chapter 3 of this Management Directive.) 

15.  

Issue an order determining full relief. 

Administrative Judges shall issue an order  awarding full relief where the 
agency unilaterally and unconditionally promises in writing to provide the 
full  and  complete  remedy  as  defined  by  the  Administrative  Judge.    To 
permit him/her to determine the appropriate remedy for the complaint, the 
Administrative Judge may require the parties to submit statements of full 
relief,  may  receive  evidence  including  testimony,  and/or  require  oral 
argument.  After issuing the order and a determination of the appropriate 
remedy,  the  Administrative  Judge  shall  return  the  hearing  file  to  the 
agency,  which  shall  have  forty  (40)  days  to  take  final  action.    29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.110(a).    Once  the  agency  takes  final  action,  the  complainant  will 
have thirty days within which to file an appeal.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.402(a).  
If  the  agency fails to provide the full  and  complete remedy  as  promised, 
the  complainant  may  seek  compliance  from  the  agency  and,  failing  that, 
file  an  appeal  with  the  Commission.    See  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.504(a);  see 
also Miller v. Dep’t. of the Treasury, EEOC Request No. 05980345 (July

16.   Hold a hearing in abeyance. 

An Administrative Judge may hold a hearing in abeyance in the event that 
a party is  unable  to proceed  with the hearing  for  reasons  such  as  illness, 
military assignment, or other good cause shown.  

E. 

Summary Judgment (Decisions without a Hearing) 

1.  On Motion of a Party 

A  party  who  believes  that  some  or  all  material  facts  are  not  in  genuine 
dispute may file a motion for summary judgment with the Administrative 
Judge at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, or at such earlier time 
as required by the Administrative Judge.  The Administrative Judge may, 
in the acknowledgment order, specify a date for filing such a motion and 
provide  for  extending that time in  certain circumstances.   A  copy of any 
such motion shall be served on the opposing party.  

The opposing party will have 15 days from the receipt of the statement in 
which to file any opposition to the statement. 

After  considering  the  request  and  the  opposing  submission,  if  any,  the 
Administrative  Judge  may  deny  the  request,  order  that  discovery  be 
permitted on the facts involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining 
in dispute (if any), issue a decision without a hearing, or make such other 
rulings as are appropriate.  

2. 

On Administrative Judge’s Determination 

If  the  Administrative  Judge  determines  that  some  or  all  of  the  material 
facts are not in genuine dispute, s/he may, after giving notice to the parties 
and providing them an opportunity to respond within 15 days of receipt of 
the  notice,  issue  an  order  limiting  the  scope  of  the  hearing  or  issue  a 
summary judgment decision without conducting a hearing.  

3.  

Oral Argument or Testimony on Summary Judgment Motion 

At  his/her  discretion,  the  Administrative  Judge  may  provide  notice 
requiring the parties to appear and present oral argument or testimony on a 
motion for summary judgment.

Legal Standard for the Use of Summary Judgment 

Summary  judgment  is  proper  when  “material  facts  are  not  in  genuine 
dispute.”  29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(g).  Only a dispute over facts that are truly 
material  to  the  outcome  of  the  case  should  preclude  summary  judgment.   
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (only disputes 
over  facts  that  might  affect  the  outcome  of  the  suit  under  the  governing 
law,  and  not  irrelevant  or  unnecessary  factual  disputes,  will  preclude  the 
entry of summary judgment).  For example, when a complainant is unable 
to  set  forth  facts  necessary  to  establish  one  essential  element  of  a  prima 
facie case, a dispute over facts necessary to prove another element of the 
case would not be material to the outcome.  Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 
317, 322-323 (1986). 

Moreover, a mere recitation that  there is  a factual dispute is insufficient.  
The party opposing summary judgment must identify the disputed facts in 
the  record  with  specificity  or  demonstrate  that  there  is  a  dispute  by 
producing affidavits or records that tend to disprove the facts asserted by 
the moving party.  In addition, the non-moving party must explain how the 
facts  in  dispute  are  material  under  the  legal  principles  applicable  to  the 
case.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(g)(2); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-324; Patton v.

pleading that his job performance was good but set forth no specific facts 
regarding  his  performance  and  identified  no  specific  inadequacies  in  the 
investigation). 

F. 

Transmittal of the Decision and Hearing Record 

At the conclusion of the hearing stage the Administrative Judge shall send to the 
parties  (the  agency  representative,  the  agency  EEO  Director  or  EEO  Office,  the 
complainant, and the complainant’s representative) copies of the record produced 
at the hearing stage of the process, including the transcript of the hearing, if any, 
as well as the decision. 

The Administrative Judge may, when necessary, release the transcript prior to the 
issuance of the decision, for example, when the transcript is needed to prepare a 
post-hearing brief or to prepare for a hearing on relief. 

The  Administrative  Judge  may  issue  a  decision  from  the  bench  after  the 
conclusion of the hearing, in lieu of issuing a written decision.

IV.  DISCOVERY 

A. 

Introduction 

1. 

General 

EEO MD-110 

The  purpose  of  discovery  is  to  enable  a  party  to  obtain  relevant 
information for preparation of the party’s case.  Both parties are entitled to 
reasonable development of evidence on issues raised in the complaint, and 
the Administrative Judge may limit the quantity and timing of discovery.   

A reasonable amount of official time shall be allowed to prepare requests 
for  discovery  and  to  respond  to  discovery  requests.    (See  Chapter  6, 
Section VII.C of this Management Directive.)  

2. 

Avoidance of Delay 

The  discovery  instructions  that  follow  are  intended  to  provide  a  simple 
method of discovery.  They will be interpreted and applied so as to avoid 
delay and to facilitate adjudication of the case.  The parties are expected to 
initiate and complete needed discovery with a minimum of intervention by 
the Commission’s Administrative Judge.  The parties are further expected 
to use discovery judiciously for its intended purpose only. 

B. 

Right to Seek Discovery 

1. 

Notice of Right to Seek Discovery 

The Administrative Judge shall send the parties an acknowledgment order 
advising  the  parties  that  they  may  commence  discovery.    It  is  the 
Commission’s  policy  that  the  parties  are  entitled,  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(b),  to  the  reasonable  development  of  evidence  on  the  issues 
raised in the complaint.   

2. 

Discovery Is Designed to Supplement the Record 

It  is  anticipated  that  discovery  will  ordinarily  involve  supplementing  the 
existing  record.    There  may  be  situations  in  which  the  record  does  not 
have to be supplemented.

3. 

Discovery Time Frames Will Be Strictly Regarded 

Discovery must be completed by such time ordered by the Administrative 
Judge.    Parties  may  request  to  extend  the  time  for  discovery  beyond  the 
time limit set.  The Administrative Judge may modify the time frame for 
completing  discovery  either  by  extending  it  or  by  curtailing  it  as  the 
Administrative  Judge  may  determine.    To  be  considered,  any  request  for 
extension must be made prior to the expiration of the time limit by motion 
and  accompanied  with  a  proposed  order  and  shall  state  whether  the 
opposing party agrees or objects to the motion or order. 

4. 

Requests for Private Information Should Be Limited 

Agency  requests  for  the  medical  records  of  complainants  should  only 
occur to establish or challenge disability status or the  right to reasonable 
accommodation  in  Rehabilitation  Act  cases,  or  when  a  complainant  is 
asserting  a  claim  for  compensatory  damages  and  has  sought  medical 
treatment  for  one  or  more  stress-related  conditions.    In  such  instances, 
agency  requests  for  medical  records  shall  be  narrowly  tailored  to  the 
condition(s) and temporal scope at issue.  As discussed in detail in Chapter 
11,  Section  VII,  complainants  are  not  required  to  prove  compensatory 
damages through medical records or other expert evidence.  See Lawrence 
v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01952288  (Apr.  18,  1996) 
(citing Carle v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 
1993)). 

Where a complainant is pro se, agencies must request the Administrative 
Judge’s prior permission before making requests for medical information, 
and the  Administrative Judge  shall advise  the parties of  this  provision at 
the initial status conference.  The Administrative Judge shall also explain 
that  a  complainant  should  contact  the  Administrative  Judge  to  request  a 
protective  order  if  the  complainant  believes  agency  counsel  is  seeking 
overly broad or intrusive medical records through discovery requests. 

Similarly, agency requests for wage information  should only occur when 
the  complainant  is  making  a  back  pay  claim  and  has  received 
compensation  for  subsequent  employment.    Agencies  are  not  authorized 
and  must  request  prior  permission  from  the  Administrative  Judge  before 
making requests for production of a complainant’s tax records except with 
respect  to  W-2  (earned  income)  and  Schedule  C  (profit  or  loss) 
documents.

C.  Methods of Discovery 

EEO MD-110 

1. 

Evidence may be developed using a variety of methods, including: 

a. 

Interrogatories 

Absent  specific  authorization  from  the  Administrative  Judge,  a 
party may submit no more than one set of interrogatories and a set 
of interrogatories shall not exceed thirty (30) in number including 
all discrete subparts. 

b. 

Depositions 

Generally  the  party  requesting  depositions  will  pay  for  them.    A 
failure  to appear  at a properly scheduled  deposition may result in 
the  non-appearing  party  bearing  the  cost  of  the  missed  session.   
Agencies  must  make  federal  employees  available  for  depositions 
and such depositions shall be taken  on  official time.   The  agency 
may  be  liable  for  costs  incurred  if  such  persons  are  not  made 
available on the clock for depositions or other discovery or if such 
persons fail to appear. 

c. 

Stipulations 

Stipulations are strongly encouraged. 

d. 

Requests for Admissions 

Absent  specific  authorization  from  the  Administrative  Judge,  a 
request for admissions shall not exceed 30 in number including all 
discrete  subparts.    This  limit  does  not  apply,  however,  to 
the  authenticity  or  genuineness  of 
admissions  relating 
documents. 

to 

e. 

Requests for the Production of Documents 

Absent  specific  authorization  from  the  Administrative  Judge, 
requests  must  be  specific,  identifying  the  document  or  types  of 
documents requested.  A set of document requests shall not exceed 
30 in number including all discrete subparts.

2. 

Where  possible,  more  informal  methods  of  discovery  should  be 
employed 

In  many  instances,  discovery  should  proceed  on  an  informal  basis, 
including unrecorded meetings and conference calls designed to exchange 
information.    For  example,  if  a  primary  purpose  of  discovery  is  to 
determine the scope and content of a material witness’s testimony, it may 
be sufficient  that  there be a meeting scheduled  with  the  witness  and that 
the  discovery  be  conducted  on  an  informal  basis.    If  that  method  proves 
unsatisfactory, a more formal method of discovery may be used.   
When  information  gathering  and  hearing  preparation  takes  place  outside 
the  scope  of  formal  discovery,  agencies  may  not  restrict  access  to  non-
management  employees  who  voluntarily  cooperate  with 
informal 
discovery. 

a. 

b. 

The  parties  may  agree  that  a  witness  be  made  available  for 
questioning without the production of a transcript or tape recording 
where the purpose is to discover the availability of other evidence, 
either documentary or testimonial. 

The parties may agree to the questioning of witnesses using a tape-
recording device, provided that any such tape will not be accepted 
in  evidence  without  authentication.    Such  authentication  can  be 
presumed where the opposing party is provided a copy of the tape 
at the close of the discovery session and it is identical to the tape 
proffered in evidence. 

D. 

Discovery Procedures 

1. 

Commencing Discovery 

a. 

Requests for authorization to commence  

Unless  the  Administrative  Judge  requires  that  a  party  request 
authorization to commence discovery, parties may begin discovery 
upon receipt of the Administrative Judge’s acknowledgment order.  

the  Administrative  Judge  requires 

If 
that  a  party  request 
authorization  to  commence  discovery,  the  request  must  state  the 
method(s)  and  scope  of  discovery  requested  and  its  relevance  to 
the issue(s) in the complaint.

b. 

Exchange of requests 

Upon receipt of the Administrative Judge’s authorization to begin 
discovery  or  acknowledgment  order  that  does  not  require  the 
parties to seek authorization, the parties must, within  twenty (20) 
calendar days or such period of time ordered by the Administrative 
Judge, exchange initial requests for discovery.  If a party does not 
submit  an  initial  discovery  request  to  opposing  party  within  that 
period, the Administrative Judge may determine that the party has 
waived its right to pursue discovery. 

The  parties  must  cooperate  with  each  other  in  honoring  requests 
for relevant, non-repetitive documentary and testimonial evidence.  
The  parties  shall  not  use  any  form  of  discovery  or  discovery 
scheduling  for  harassment,  for  unjustified  delay,  to  increase 
litigation  expenses,  or

Requests  for  discovery  should  be  addressed  to  the  agency 
representative, 
complainant’s 
representative  of  record,  and  not  to  the  Administrative 
Judge,  unless  requested  by  the  Administrative  Judge.   
Where  a  party  addresses  a  request  for  discovery  to  the 
Administrative  Judge,  the  Administrative  Judge  may,  at 
his/her discretion, return the request to the party submitting 
the  discovery  request  with  instructions  to  serve  it  on  the 
appropriate  party,  or  may  forward  the  request  to  the 
appropriate party.  Where a party inappropriately submits a 
discovery request to the Administrative Judge, the required 
time  frame  for  submitting  the  request  to  the  appropriate 
party will not stop running unless the Administrative Judge 
rules otherwise.  Copies of discovery requests should not be 
provided  to  the  Administrative  Judge  unless  a  motion  to 
compel or  a response to a motion to compel is being filed 
or if otherwise directed by the Administrative Judge.

Apex Oil Co. v. Belcher Co., 855 F.2d 1009, 1020 (2d Cir. 1988) 
(failure to confer in good faith over discovery disputes multiplied

A motion to compel compliance with a request for discovery must 
be  addressed  to  the  Administrative  Judge  and  the  moving  party 
must certify that a copy was served on the opposing party. 

Any statement in opposition to the motion must be filed within ten 
(10)  calendar  days  of  service  of  the  motion  and  the  responding 
party must certify that a copy was served on the moving party. 

A party’s failure to raise an objection to a discovery request within 
the  time  period  to  respond  to  it  may  be  determined  by  the 
Administrative Judge to be a waiver of that party’s ability to object 
to the request at a later date.

Administrative Judges Will Rule Expeditiously on Discovery Issues  

Following  the  filing  of  an  opposition,  if  any,  to  the  motion  to  compel 
discovery, the Administrative Judge will rule expeditiously on the request 
for  discovery.    In  the  alternative,  the  Administrative  Judge  may,  in  the 
interest of expediting the hearing, order that the document(s), witness(es), 
or  other  evidence  at  issue  be  produced  at  the  hearing.    Where  the 
Administrative Judge finds that the request for discovery that is the subject 
of  the  motion  to  compel  is  irrelevant,  overburdening,  repetitious,  or 
privileged, the Administrative Judge will deny the motion to compel and 
may, upon the request of the party opposing the motion to compel, or upon 
the Administrative Judge’s own initiative, issue such protective orders as 
the Administrative Judge determines appropriate.

Administrative Judge’s Orders to Comply 

a. 

In considering a motion to compel compliance, the Administrative 
Judge will consider whether the following factors apply: 

(1) 

the  discovery  is  calculated  to  produce  or  lead  to  the 
production  of  material  evidence  that  is  not  repetitious  of 
facts or documents already in the complaint file,  

(2) 

the  discovery  does  not  concern  privileged  or  restricted 
information, and  

(3) 

the discovery is not overly burdensome. 

b. 

Where  a  motion  to  compel  discovery  is  approved,  in  whole  or  in 
part, the Administrative Judge shall issue a written order to comply 
with the request.  The parties shall have 15 calendar days or such 
other  time  period  ordered  by  the  Administrative  Judge  to  comply 
with a discovery order.  

6. 

Failure  to  Respond  or  Comply  with  Administrative  Judge’s  Order 
May Result in Sanctions 

A  failure  to  respond  or  follow  an  order  to  comply  with  a  request  for 
discovery may result in sanctions.  See Section III.D.10 of this Chapter. 

Failure to Request Discovery Implies Waiver of Subsequent Requests for 

E. 
Documents 

It is the intention of the Commission that the parties utilize the informal or formal 
discovery  procedures  provided  for  in  this  Chapter  to  develop  the  record  in  the 
complaint  or  that  the  record  be  developed  to  the  extent  necessary  through  the 
Administrative Judge’s orders for documents, information, and witnesses.  Under 
previous  Commission  guidance,  the  failure  to  request  discovery  did  not  imply  a 
waiver  of  the  opportunity  of  the  parties  to  make  requests  for  documents  and 
witnesses  at  the  hearing.    Allowing  parties  this  opportunity  at  the  time  of  the 
hearing,  regardless  of  whether  the  discovery  process  was  invoked,  is  not 
consistent  with  sound  administrative  economy  and  with  the  expeditious 
processing  of  complaints.    Accordingly,  where  a  party  has  not  timely  requested 
discovery  or  has  not  otherwise  timely  requested  that  the  Administrative  Judge 
order the opposing party to produce documents, the party’s request for documents 
for the first time at the time of the hearing, or at a pre-hearing conference held just

prior to the hearing, will be disallowed unless the Administrative Judge, in his/her 
discretion, rules otherwise.  

F. 

Cost of Discovery 

The parties shall initially bear their own costs with regard to discovery, unless the 
Administrative Judge requires the agency to bear the costs for the complainant to 
obtain  depositions  or  any  other  discovery  because  the  agency  has  failed  to 
complete  its  investigation  timely  as  required  by  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.108(e)  or  has 
failed  to  investigate  the  allegations  adequately  pursuant  to  Chapter  6  of  this 
Management Directive. 

V. 

EXCLUSION AND DISQUALIFICATION 

All participants in the EEO hearing process have a duty to maintain the decorum required 
for a fair  and orderly  proceeding and to  obey orders of  the  Administrative Judge.  Any 
person  who  engages  in  improper  behavior  or  contumacious  conduct  (as  defined  in 
Section V.A.3 of this Chapter) at any time subsequent to the docketing of a complaint for 
a hearing is subject to sanction.  Section 1614.109(e) of 29 C.F.R. provides that persons 
may  be  excluded  from  the  hearing  for  contumacious  conduct  or  misbehavior  that 
obstructs  the  hearing.    It  further  provides  that  if  the  complainant’s  or  agency’s 
representative  engages  in  misconduct  or  refuses  to  obey  an  order  of  the  Administrative 
Judge,  the  Commission  may  suspend  or  disqualify  the  representative  from  future 
hearings, refer the matter to an appropriate licensing authority, or both.   

A. 

Exclusion from a Hearing 

An Administrative Judge has the power to regulate the conduct of a hearing and to 
exclude any person from a hearing for contumacious conduct or misbehavior that 
obstructs  the  hearing.    See  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109(e).    The  Administrative  Judge 
may exclude any disruptive person, including the complainant, an agency official, 
or  a  representative,  including  agency  or  complainant  counsel.    This  sanction 
generally applies to conduct occurring in the  Administrative Judge’s presence at 
any  point  during  the  hearing  process,  including  prehearing  proceedings  and 
teleconferences as well as the hearing itself.  It also applies to a representative’s 
refusal  to  obey  orders  of  the  Administrative  Judge.    The  exclusion  bars  the 
individual,  for  the  duration  of  the  hearing  process,  from  further  participation  in 
the  case  in  which  the  misconduct  occurs.    (In  contrast,  a  disqualification  of  a 
representative applies to future hearings.  The procedure for disqualification is in 
Section V.B below.) 

Management Directive 
7-27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110 

August, 2015 

The authority of an Administrative Judge to impose an exclusion under 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(e)  derives from the judicial doctrine  of the  “inherent  powers”  of the 
forum.  For example, courts have certain implied powers that are necessary to the 
exercise of all others.  Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991).  “Courts of 
justice  are  universally  acknowledged  to  be  vested,  by  their  very  creation,  with 
power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission 
to  their  lawful  mandates.”    Id.  at  43  (quoting  Anderson  v.  Dunn,  19  U.S.  224 
(Wheat.) 227 (1821)).  “These powers are ‘governed not by rule or statute but by 
the  control  necessarily  vested  in  courts  to  manage  their  own  affairs  so  as  to 
achieve  the  orderly  and  expeditious  disposition  of  cases.’”    Id.  (quoting  Link  v. 
Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962)). 

Inherent  powers  must  be  exercised  with  restraint  and  discretion.    Id.    In 
considering the imposition of sanctions, Administrative Judges must take steps to 
ensure fairness to the parties and the effectiveness of the sanction in furthering the 
orderly conclusion of the hearing process.  Sanctions should be proportional to the 
nature  and  degree  of  the improper conduct.   Administrative Judges  may look to 
rules of ethics, common law, statutes, and case law to determine the propriety and 
nature  of  a  sanction.    With  respect  to  sanctions  against  a  representative,  the 
Administrative Judge should be mindful that a party to the EEO process is entitled 
to be represented by an individual of that party’s choice, and the representative is 
expected  to  be  an  advocate  for  the  party’s  interests.    Nonetheless,  by  virtue  of 
their  position,  all  representatives  also  have  a  particular  responsibility  to  respect 
the order and authority of the EEO process.  See subsection 4 below. 

1. 

Relationship to other sanctions 

In  addition  to  exclusion  under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109(e)  for  misconduct, 
other  sanctions  may  be  imposed  for  failure  to  obey  orders  of  an 
Administrative Judge.   Section 1614.109(f)(3) of 29 C.F.R. provides that 
when  the  complainant,  the  agency,  or  its  employees  fail  without  good 
cause  shown  to  respond  fully  and  in  timely  fashion  to  an  order  of  an 
Administrative Judge, or requests for the investigative file, for documents, 
records,  comparative  data,  statistics,  affidavits,  or  the  attendance  of 
witnesses, the Administrative Judge shall impose sanctions in appropriate 
circumstances.   

Sanctions under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f) may be evidentiary, monetary, or 
both.    The  failure  of  a  party  to  produce  evidence  or  obey  an  order  may 
support the drawing of an adverse inference about a matter in dispute, the 
exclusion  of  other  evidence  offered  by  that  party,  or  a  decision  on  the 
merits in favor of the other party.  Monetary sanctions include attorney’s 
fees and the costs of discovery.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3).

Preventive measures 

lessen 

the  need  for  resort 

to  exclusion  or  other  sanctions, 
To 
Administrative Judges may instruct the parties in the initial order and/or at 
the outset of the hearing to maintain professional conduct and speech.  The 
parties should be informed that engaging in improper conduct or failing to 
comply  with  orders  of 
the  Administrative  Judge  or  Commission 
regulations  may  result  in  sanctions  under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109.   Giving 
such  a  warning  is  within  the  Administrative  Judge’s  discretion  however.  
Any  asserted  failure  to  advise  the  parties  of  the  potential  for  sanctions 
does not limit the Administrative Judge’s authority to impose a sanction.  

3. 

General standard for exclusion 

A  person’s  conduct  is  contumacious  when  it  is  “willfully  stubborn  and 
disobedient.”    Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (6th  ed.  1990).    Contumacious 
behavior  or  disruptive  conduct  may  include  any  unprofessional  or 
disrespectful behavior; degrading, insulting, or threatening verbal remarks 
or conduct; the use of profanity; or conduct engaged in for the purpose of 
improperly delaying the hearing.16  A finding of contumacious conduct or 
disruptive  behavior  may  be  based  on  a  series  of  disruptive  incidents,  a 
pattern  of  acts,  or  a  single  sufficiently  obstructive  episode.17
    Normally, 
any  pattern  should  be  manifest  within  a  single  case.    However,  the

engaged in by the individual on any previous occasion before that judge, if 

16  In  Bradley  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  Nos.  01952244,  01963827  (September  18, 
1996), the Commission rejected the complainant’s contention that he was denied a fair hearing because 
the Administrative Judge had complainant and his representative escorted from the hearing room under 
guard and terminated the hearing.  The Commission found that complainant’s representative “engaged in 
contumacious  conduct  of  the  worst  kind:  asking  questions  which  the  witnesses  could  not  comprehend, 
then  berating  the  witnesses  for  failing  to  answer;  repeatedly  testifying  rather  than  asking  questions; 
vociferously arguing on the record with the agency representative and the Administrative Judge; defying 
the  authority  of  the  Administrative  Judge  with  regard  to  evidentiary  rulings  and  the  conduct  of  the 
hearing; and threatening the Administrative Judge over an evidentiary ruling.”  Misconduct does not have 
to rise to this level to be subject to sanction.  Any one of the types of misconduct noted in Bradley would 
alone be sufficient.  

17 See In re Chaplain, 621 F.2d 1272, 1276 (4th Cir. 1980) (“contempt of court may be found based 
on the cumulative impact of a series of actions, no one of which standing alone would be sufficient: ‘It is 
only  necessary  that  a  contumacious  act  be  ‘a  volitional  [one]  done  by  one  who  knows  or  should 
reasonably be aware that his conduct is wrongful.’’”)(citations omitted).

the  Administrative  Judge  had  clearly  described  the  misconduct  for  the 
record  in  the  earlier  proceeding  or  the  misconduct  is  otherwise  clearly 
apparent from the record. 

In  addition,  there  may  be  situations  in  which  a  decision  to  exclude  a 
person  may  take  into  consideration  prior  misconduct  before  a  different 
Administrative  Judge  or  the  Commission.    For  example,  in  the  first 
instance of misconduct, the Administrative Judge, in his/her discretion and 
as part of the sanction, may publicize the sanction to other Administrative 
Judges  or  require  the  sanctioned  individual  to  disclose  the  sanction  to 
other  Administrative  Judges.    This  should  be  done  in  appropriate 
circumstances,  taking  into  account  the  nature  and  degree  of  the 
misconduct.    If  the  sanctioned  individual  engages  in  further  improper 
conduct  in  a  subsequent  hearing  before  the  same  or  a  different 
Administrative  Judge,  the  prior  sanction  should  be  considered  in 
determining  whether  to  exclude  the  individual  from  the  subsequent 
hearing.    To  that  end,  the  Administrative  Judge  also  may  ask  an 
individual,  on  the  record,  to  disclose  whether  or  not  s/he  ever  had 
previously been sanctioned in any way before the Commission.

Standard for exclusion of representative 

Representatives may also be excluded for refusal to follow the orders of an 
Administrative  Judge  or  other 
to 
“contumacious  conduct  or  misbehavior  that  obstructs  the  hearing.”  
Representatives  have  a  special  duty  to  maintain  the  dignity  of  the  EEO 
process  and  to  preserve  the  order  and  authority  of  the  EEO  forum  and 
must act accordingly.   

improper  conduct, 

in  addition 

If  a  party’s  representative  engages  in  repetitive  misconduct  or  conduct 
justifying  exclusion,  the  Commission  also  will  consider  imposing  a 
suspension or disqualification through the procedure described in Section 
B below.  If the representative is an attorney, s/he also may be referred to 
the  appropriate  bar  association  for  disciplinary  action  as  provided  in 
Section C below. 

5. 

Procedure for exclusion 

Unless the improper  conduct is so egregious  as  to  compromise the order 
required  for  a  fair  and  orderly  proceeding,  the  Administrative  Judge 
normally should first warn the offending person to stop the conduct.  The 
warning should  give notice that if the  conduct  continues, the person will 
be excluded from the hearing.   

Management Directive 
7-30

EEO MD-110 

When  imposing  the  sanction,  the  Administrative  Judge  must  ensure  that 
the  record  includes  a  clear  and  specific  description  of  the  nature  of  the 
misconduct.    The  record  must  include  the  particular  details  of  what  the 
person  said  or  did,  rather  than  a  conclusory  characterization.18
    The 
Administrative  Judge  may  place  the  information  on  the  record  through  a 
statement at the hearing or, if the misconduct occurred in a teleconference 
or other proceeding without a court reporter, by inclusion in a prehearing 
conference memorandum or order or through a written statement provided 
to the individual.  Any gestures or actions that would not be apparent from 
the  hearing  transcript  should  be  clearly  described  for  the  record.    If  the 
person used profanity or other improper or threatening language before the 
Administrative  Judge  while  off  the  record  or  at  a  proceeding  that  is  not 
being  transcribed,  the  Administrative  Judge  should  relate  the  particular 
language used in a statement on the record or other written statement made 
a part of the record. 

An Administrative Judge’s decision to exclude a person from a hearing is 
final.  There is no right to an interlocutory appeal of an exclusion decision.  
A party may raise the issue as part of an appeal of the final order on the 
case when the party asserts it has been deprived the opportunity for a fair 
hearing. 

If  the  complainant  engages  in  obstructive  misconduct  or  contumacious 
conduct,  the  Administrative  Judge  should  warn  the  complainant  as 
described  above  and  consider  recessing  the  hearing  for  a  short  time  to 
restore  order.    If  the  complainant’s  misconduct  is  extreme  or  persistent, 
the Administrative Judge may, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.109(b) and 
1614.107(a)(7),  dismiss  the  case  for  failure  to  cooperate  or  issue  a 
decision  if  the  record  is  sufficient  to  permit  adjudication.    29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(g). 

If the complainant’s representative is excluded, the complainant should be 
given  the  option  of  proceeding  without  his/her  representative.    If  the 
agency’s representative is excluded, the Administrative Judge must notify 
the agency of the exclusion.  In either case, the Administrative Judge may, 
in his/her discretion, continue the hearing to allow time for the designation 
of  a  new  representative  or,  in  appropriate  circumstances,  terminate  the 

18  For  example,  the  description  might  state  that  the  party’s  representative,  despite  a  warning  to 
remain  at  his  seat,  “repeatedly  rose  out  of  his  chair,  walked  around  the  hearing  room,  and  pointed  his 
finger close to the witness’s face while berating the witness in a loud voice and cutting short the witness’s 
answers, making the following statements to the witness: . . . .”

hearing, and decide the case based on the record if the record is sufficient 
to permit adjudication.   

The Administrative Judge also may impose an evidentiary sanction against 
either party as provided in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3).  For example, when 
misconduct  has  prevented  or  hindered  the  development  of  evidence,  the 
Administrative Judge may draw an adverse inference; consider the matter 
to be established in favor of the opposing party; exclude other evidence; or 
issue  a  decision  fully  or  partially  in  favor  of  the  opposing  party.    See 
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.109(f)(3).    The  standard  for  imposing  such  a  sanction 
must be the same for both complainants and agencies.  A sanction should 
be  proportional  to  the  level  of  the  misconduct  and  reflect  the  degree  to 
which the misconduct has impeded a full and fair hearing.

Disqualification of a Representative from Future Hearings 

1. 

Standard for suspension and disqualification19

In  the  case  of  repeated  or  flagrant  improper  conduct  by  a  representative, 
the  Administrative  Judge  or  the  Commission  may  take  further  action.   
Section  1614.109(e)  of  29  C.F.R.  provides  that  the  Commission,  after 
notice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  may  suspend  or  disqualify  from 
representing complainants or agencies in future Commission hearings any 
representative who refuses to follow the Administrative Judge’s orders or 
otherwise engages in improper conduct.  These provisions apply not only 
to  conduct  at  the  hearing  stage  of  the  case  but  also  to  all  other  actions 
taken  by  a  representative  in  the  course  of  an  EEO  proceeding,  including 
the  appeal.    A  disqualification  applies  to  future  representation  of  a  party 
before the Commission, at both the hearing and appellate stages.

19  In  addition  to  disqualification  under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109(e)  for  misconduct,  the  term 
“disqualification” is also used when the representation of a complainant or agency would conflict with the 
official or collateral duties of the representative.  Under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.605(c), in that circumstance, the 
Commission or the agency may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the 
representative.    In  contrast  to  disqualification  for  misconduct,  a  disqualification  for  conflict  of  interest 
under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.605(c) applies only to the particular case.  Parties shall disclose and reasonably 
attempt to avoid all conflicts of interest.

For improper conduct or a refusal to follow orders at the hearing stage, the 
Administrative  Judge  will  issue  the  show  cause  order  and  certify  the 
matter to the Director, Office of  Federal Operations, for a determination.  
In  addition,  the  Administrative  Judge  may,  separately  or  simultaneously, 
issue an order excluding the representative from the hearing process in the 
case  at  bar,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  discussed  above.    If  the 
representative  is  an  attorney,  referral  to  the  appropriate  bar  association 
normally should be considered as well, pursuant to Section C below.  

For improper conduct during the appeal, the Office of Federal Operations 
will  issue  the  show  cause  order.    In  all  cases,  the  representative  must 
submit  his/her  response  to  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Federal 
Operations.    The  Director  or  his/her  designee  will  issue  a  final  order, 
which is not appealable. 

An order suspending or disqualifying a representative from future hearings 
must specify the time period the penalty will be in effect, which must be 
commensurate with the severity of the conduct. 

When the Administrative Judge or the Commission proposes to suspend or 
disqualify the agency’s representative, a copy of the show cause order and 
subsequent decision must be provided to the agency’s EEO Director.

CHAPTER 8  
COMPLAINTS OF CLASS DISCRIMINATION 
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Section  1614.204  of  Title  29  C.F.R.  provides  for  processing  class  complaints  of 
discrimination.    A  class  is  defined  as  a  group  of  employees,  former  employees,  or 
applicants who are alleged to have been adversely affected by an agency personnel policy 
or  practice  which  discriminates  against  the  group  on  the  basis  of  their  common  race, 
color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  genetic  information,  or  disability.    A  class 
complaint  is  a  written  complaint  of  discrimination  filed  on  behalf  of  the  class  by  the 
agent of the class, alleging that the class is so numerous that a consolidated complaint by 
the  members  of  the  class  is  impractical,  that  there  are  questions  of  fact  common  to  the 
class, that the claims of the agent of the class are typical of the claims of the class, and 
that the agent of the class and, if represented, the representative will fairly and adequately 
protect the interests of the class. 

The  regulatory  requirements  for  class  complaints  at  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204  provide  a 
structure  different  from  that  for  individual  complaints.    For  class  complaints,  there  is  a 
four-stage  process.    The  first  stage  is  the  establishment  of  a  class  complaint.    At  this 
stage, the class agent is required to seek counseling from an agency EEO Counselor and 
file a complaint.  The second stage is a determination from a Commission Administrative 
Judge,  subject  to  agency  final  action,  implementing  or  appealing  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision on class certification.  The third stage, assuming that the complaint has 
been certified as a class action, involves a final decision from an Administrative Judge on 
the merits of the class complaint.  The agency can either fully implement or appeal.   If 
the  agency  appeals  the  Administrative  Judge’s  final  decision,  it  only  has  to  appeal  the 
parts of the decision that it is contesting.  The fourth stage, where there has been a finding 
of  class-based  discrimination,  is  the  determination  of  the  claims  for  relief  of  the 
individual class members.  

II. 

PRE-CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES 

A. 

Pre-Complaint Processing 

Section  1614.204(b)  of  29  C.F.R.  provides  that,  as  with  an  individual 
complainant, an employee who seeks to represent a class of employees must seek 
counseling  and  undergo  pre-complaint  processing  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105  and  Chapter  2  of  this  Management  Directive,  with  one  exception, 
discussed below.  Section 1614.105(a)(1) of 29 C.F.R. requires that an employee 
must seek counseling within forty-five (45) days of the discriminatory event.  The 

Management Directive 
8-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEO MD-110  

August, 2015 

agency shall extend the 45-day time limit when the individual shows that s/he was 
not notified of the time limits and was not aware of them, that s/he did not know 
and  reasonably  should  not  have  known  that  the  discriminatory  practice  or 
personnel  action  occurred,  that  despite  due  diligence  s/he  was  prevented  by 
circumstances beyond his/her control from contacting the EEO Counselor within 
the  time  limits,  or  for  other  reasons  considered  sufficient  by  the  agency  or  the 
Commission.   See 29 C.F.R.  § 1614.105(a)(2).   The time  period  may  be  waived 
by  the  agency  and  is  subject  to  estoppel  and  equitable  tolling.    See  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.604(c).    If  the  complaint  is  not  resolved  on  the  thirtieth  (30th)  day 
following initial EEO counseling, the EEO Counselor must give the agent written 
notice  that  s/he  has  fifteen  (15)  days  from  receipt  of  the  notice  to  file  a  formal 
complaint.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(c)(2). 

The  counseling  period  may  be  extended  up  to  an  additional  sixty  (60)  days  if, 
prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, the aggrieved person agrees with the 
agency in writing to postpone the final interview. 

The one exception to the mandatory counseling prerequisite allows a complainant 
to  move  for  class  certification  at  any  reasonable  point  in  the  process  when  it 
becomes  apparent  that  there  are  class  implications  to  the  claim  raised  in  an 
individual  complaint.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204(b).1
    The  Commission  intends  that 
“reasonable  point  in  the  process”  be  interpreted  to  allow  a  complainant  to  seek 
class  certification  when  s/he  knows  or  suspects  that  the  complaint  has  class 
implications,  that  is,  the  complaint  potentially  involves  questions  of  law  or  fact 
common  to  a  class  and  the  complainant’s  claim  is  typical  of  that  of  the  class.   
Undue  delay  in  moving  for  certification  will  lead  to  denial  of  the  class 
certification  by  the  Administrative  Judge.    If  a  complainant  moves  for  class 
certification  after  completing  the  pre-complaint  process  contained  in  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105,  no  additional  counseling  is  required.    See  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.204(b).   
Instead, the agency  or  the Administrative Judge, as  appropriate,  must  advise the 
complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities as the class agent. 

B. 

Filing and Presentation of the Class Complaint 

As with an individual complaint, a class complaint must be filed with the agency 
that allegedly discriminated against the putative  class.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.106(a).  
A class complaint must be signed by the class agent (the complainant) or a class 
representative  and  must  identify  the  policy  or  practice  adversely  affecting  the 

1  The  term  “move”  in  this  context  means  that  the  complainant  must  make  his/her  intention  to 
process the complaint as a class action clear.  A complainant may make his/her intention clear through a 
letter, a formal motion, or any means that effectively informs the agency or Administrative Judge of the 
complainant’s intent to pursue a class action.

class as well as the specific action or policy affecting the class agent.  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.204(c)(1). 

Within thirty (30) days of an agency's receipt of a class complaint, including the 
agency’s  receipt  of  the  class  complaint  during  its  investigation  of  the  aggrieved 
person’s individual complaint, an agency must designate an agency representative 
and forward the complaint, along with a copy of the EEO Counselor’s Report and 
any  other  relevant  information  about  the  complaint,  to  the  Commission.   
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.204(d)(1).    When  any  complaint  is  filed,  an  agency  must  take 
care  to  preserve  any  and  all  evidence  with  potential  relevance  to  the  class 
complaint.  This is a continuing obligation that begins as soon as the complaint is 
filed,  even  before  the  class  has  been  certified,  and  continues  throughout  the 
processing of the complaint.  

The  agency  must  forward  the  class  complaint  to  the  Commission  district  office 
having jurisdiction over the agency facility where the complaint arose.  Appendix 
N  to  this  Management  Directive  is  a  list  of  the  addresses  of  the  Commission 
district  and  field  offices,  their  geographic  jurisdictions,  and  where  federal 
employees and applicants should submit hearing requests.  

Should the agency’s organizational component where the complaint arose not fall 
within one of the geographical jurisdictions shown, the agency should contact the 
following office for guidance:

INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINTS FILED ON BASES AND ISSUES 
IDENTICAL TO CLASS COMPLAINTS 

When a complainant who is  a potential member of  a class action files an  individual complaint 
between the time a class complaint is filed and a final certification decision is issued, the agency 
must determine  whether  there are claims in the  individual complaint that are identical to those 
that are presented in the class complaint.  If the agency determines that claims in the individual 
and  class  complaints  are  identical,  then  the  agency  shall  issue  a  written  decision  notifying  the 
complainant that the portion of the complaint raising claims identical to the class complaint will

be held in abeyance during the pendency of the decision to accept or reject the class complaint.2  
The  agency  decision  shall  notify  the  complainant  of  his/her  right  to  appeal  the  abeyance 
determination  to  the  Commission.3
    The  agency  decision  must  also  contain,  at  a  minimum,  a 
description  of  the  individual  claims  at  issue;  a  description  of  the  class  complaint  with  the 
definition of the putative class; the class complaint counseling report; and the status of the class 
action, including the Commission field office to which the class  complaint  has  been  sent  for  a 
determination on certification, if applicable.  

If,  however,  the  agency  finds  that  the  claim  in  the  individual  complaint  is  not  identical  to  the 
class claim then the individual complaint shall continue to be processed by the agency. 

The  Administrative  Judge  may  dismiss  a  class  complaint,  or  any  portion,  because  it  does  not 
meet the prerequisites for certification or for any of the procedural grounds listed in §1614.107.  
If a potential class complaint is dismissed by the Administrative Judge, the Agency’s final order 
adopting the dismissal shall include notification to the class agent(s) that his/her complaint will 
be  processed  as  an  individual  complaint,  or  that  the  individual  complaint  is  also  dismissed  in 
accordance with §1614.107.  In addition, within forty (40) days of receipt of an Administrative 
Judge’s decision dismissing a putative class complaint the agency shall issue an acknowledgment 
of  receipt  of  an  individual  complaint  as  required  by  29  C.F.R.  §1614.106(e)  and  process  each 
individual complaint that was held in abeyance because of the class complaint.   

If  a  class  complaint  is  certified,  all  individual  complaints  that  raise  claims  identical  to  the 
definition  of  the  class  claim(s)  shall  be  subsumed  within  the  class  complaint.    When  the  class 
claim  proceeds  to  a  hearing  on  the  merits,  the  subsumed  individual  claim(s)  may  be  presented 
during the liability stage by the class agent, or at the remedy stage by the individual complainant.  
If class-wide discrimination is not found, the agency shall process each individual claim that was 
subsumed into the class complaint.  See 29 C.F.R. §1614.204(l)(2).  

(a) 
For an individual claim to be subsumed in an accepted class complaint, it must be 
identical  in  all  respects  to  the  class  claim(s),  including  the  issue  and  basis  of 
discrimination alleged.  When an individual complaint raises multiple claims, only those 
claims that are identical to those raised in the class complaint will be subsumed in it.  The 
non-identical claims in the individual complaint shall be processed separately under the 
individual complaint process. 

2 As a point of clarification, claims that are held prior to class certification are stated to be held in 
“abeyance” and claims that are referenced as being “subsumed” are claims that become part of the class 
action  following  class  certification.    When  an  individual  complaint  raises  multiple  claims,  only  those 
claims that are identical to those in the class complaint with respect to basis and issue are properly held in 
abeyance  or  subsumed.    The  non-identical  claims  in  the  individual  complaint  shall  be  processed 
separately by the agency under the individual complaint process.

(b)  When an agency makes a decision not to process an individual claim because it is 
identical  to  and  subsumed  by  an  accepted  class  complaint,  it  shall  issue  a  decision 
advising  the  individual  complainant  of  his/her  right  to  appeal  to  OFO  for  a  ruling  on 
whether  the  individual  claim  should  be  subsumed  in  the  accepted  class  claim(s).    The 
agency  decision  must  also  contain,  at  a  minimum,  a  description  of  the  individual 
complaint  at  issue  and  a  description  of  the  certified  class  complaint  and  underlying 
certification decision(s). 

IV.  CERTIFICATION OR DISMISSAL - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(d) 

The Commission will assign an Administrative Judge (or in some limited circumstances a 
complaints  examiner  from  another  agency  may  be  assigned)  to  issue  a  decision  on 
certification of the complaint.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(d).  

A. 

Class Complaint Criteria 

A class complaint will be dismissed if: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The complaint does not meet all of the prerequisites of a class complaint 
under  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204(a)(2)  (that  is,  numerosity,  commonality, 
typicality, and adequacy of representation); 

The  claims 
§ 1614.204(d)(4); 

lack  specificity  and  detail  pursuant 

to  29  C.F.R. 

The complaint meets any of the criteria for dismissal pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.107(a), ADismissals of Complaints.” 

The Administrative Judge shall deny class certification when the complainant has 
unduly delayed in moving for certification.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(b). 

B. 

Developing the Evidence for Purpose of Certification Determination 

The  Administrative  Judge  may  direct  the  complainant  or  agency  to  submit 
additional  information  relevant  to  the  issue  of  certification.    See  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.204(d)(1).

CERTIFICATION DECISION - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(d)(7) 

A. 

Administrative Judge Issues Decision on Certification 

The Administrative Judge shall issue a decision on whether to certify or dismiss a 
class  complaint.    When  appropriate,  the  Administrative  Judge  may  decide  to 
certify a class conditionally, for a reasonable period of time, until a complainant 
finds representation.  For example, if the record on a class complaint satisfies the 
numerosity,  typicality,  and  commonality  requirements  for  class  certification,  the 
Administrative Judge may “conditionally” certify the class for a reasonable period 
of 
the  class  agent  may  secure  adequate  representation. 
Administrative Judges should refer complainants to any attorney referral systems 
that may be operating in the Commission district offices or other attorney referral 
services for assistance in obtaining adequate legal representation. 

time  so 

that 

Even after a class is certified, the Administrative Judge remains free to modify the 
certification  order  or  dismiss  the  class  complaint  in  light  of  subsequent 
developments.  See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982).  
The Administrative Judge has the authority, in response to a party’s motion or on 
his/her  own  motion,  to  redefine  a  class,  subdivide  it,  or  dismiss  it  if  the 
Administrative Judge determines that there is no longer a basis for the complaint 
to proceed as a class complaint.  Hines v. Dep’t. of the Air Force, EEOC Request 
No. 05940917 (Jan. 29, 1996). 

B. 

Transmittal of Decision 

The  Administrative  Judge  shall  transmit  his/her  decision  to  accept  or  dismiss  a 
class complaint to the agency and the agent.  The agency shall take final action by 
issuing  a  final  order  within  forty  (40)  days  of  receipt  of  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision.  The final order shall notify the agent whether the agency will 
implement the decision  of  the  Administrative Judge.   If the  final order  does not 
fully  implement  the  decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge,  the  agency  shall 
simultaneously  appeal  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  in  accordance  with 
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.403  and  append  a  copy  of  the  appeal  to  the  final  order.    The 
Commission  has  prepared  a  form  that  agencies  may  use  to  file  appeals  with  the 
Commission.  A copy of that form is attached as Appendix O. 

If the decision is to accept (certify) the class complaint, Commission regulations 
require the agency to notify all class members.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(e)(1).  The 
agency  must  use  all  reasonable  means  to  notify  all  class  members  of  the 
acceptance  of  the  complaint  within  15  days  of  receipt  of  the  Administrative 
Judge’s  decision  or  within  a  reasonable 
the 
Administrative Judge.  (See Section VI.A, below.)

An  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  to  dismiss  the  class  complaint  at  the 
certification stage  will inform  the  agent that  the  complaint  is  being  filed on that 
date  as  an  individual  complaint  and  will  be  processed  under  subpart  A,  that  the 
complaint  is  also  dismissed  as  an  individual  complaint  in  accordance  with 
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.107(a),  or,  in  the  case  of  a  complaint  forwarded  to  the 
Administrative Judge during the agency’s investigation of the complaint, that the 
complaint  is  being  returned  to  the  agency  and  will  continue  from  the  point  that 
processing ceased with the referral of the complaint to the Administrative Judge.  

C. 

Right to Appeal the Administrative Judge’s Decision 

The  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  whether  to  accept  or  dismiss  the  class 
complaint  is  subject  to  final  agency  action.    The  Administrative  Judge  shall 
transmit  his/her  decision  to  the  agency,  with  a  copy  to  the  complainant  and  the 
complainant’s representative, if any.  The agency has forty (40) days from receipt 
of the Administrative Judge’s decision to take final action by issuing a final order 
informing  the  complainant  as  to  whether  the  agency  will  fully  implement  the 
decision.    If  the  agency  informs  the  complainant  that  it  does  not  intend  to  fully 
implement  the  decision,  the  agency  must  simultaneously  file  an  appeal  with  the 
Commission  and  append  a  copy  of  the  appeal  to  the  final  order  served  on  the 
complainant.   The  agency  may use the form  appended  hereto  as Appendix O to 
file its appeal with the Commission.  The complainant will have thirty (30) days 
from receipt of the final order to file an appeal and the agency shall provide the 
complainant  with  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of  Appeal/Petition  - 
Complainant (Appendix P). 

VI.  NOTIFICATION - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(e) 

A. 

Timing and Method of the Notice 

Within fifteen  (15)  calendar  days  of  the  agency's  receipt  of  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision certifying a class complaint or such time frame specified by the 
Administrative  Judge,  the  agency  shall  use  reasonable  means,  such  as  hand 
delivery, mailing to the last known address, or distribution (such as through inter-
office mail or  email)  to notify  all class members of the certification of the class 
complaint.  An agency may file a motion with the Administrative Judge seeking a 
stay in the distribution of the notice for the purpose of determining whether it will 
fully implement or appeal the Administrative Judge’s decision. 

The  “reasonable  means”  used  by  agencies  for  notification  should  be  those  most 
likely to provide an opportunity for class members to know about the complaint.  
Conspicuous posting on bulletin boards to which all potential class members have 
easy access may constitute adequate notice in some situations.

Content of the Notice 

The notice must contain: 

August, 2015 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

the  name  of  the  agency  or  organizational  segment,  its  location,  and  the 
date of acceptance of the complaint; 

the definition of the class and a description of the issues accepted; 

an  explanation  of  the  binding  nature  of  the  decision  or  resolution  of  the 
complaint on class members;  

the name, address, and telephone number of the class representative; and  

a copy of the Administrative Judge’s decision certifying the class. 

C. 

Individuals May Not Opt Out 

The class members may not “opt out” of the defined class; however, they do not 
have  to  participate  in  the  class  or  file  a  claim  for  individual  relief.    All  class 
members  will  have  the  opportunity  to  object  to  any  proposed  settlement  and  to 
file claims for individual relief if discrimination is found.   

D. 

Settlement Notice 

All class members must receive notice of any settlement or decision on the class 
complaint whether or not they participated in the action.  See Section VII of this 
Chapter. 

VII.  DEVELOPING THE EVIDENCE - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(f) 

A. 

The Process of Developing the Evidence 

The  Administrative  Judge  shall  advise  both  parties  that  they  will  have  at  least 
sixty  (60)  days  to  develop  evidence.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204(f)(1).    They  can  do 
this  in  the  same  manner  as  in  individual  cases,  that  is,  through  interrogatories, 
depositions,  requests  for  admissions,  stipulations,  or  production  of  documents.   
The parties may object to production on the grounds that the information sought is 
irrelevant,  overly  burdensome,  repetitious,  or  privileged.    The  Administrative 
Judge has the authority to impose sanctions on a party if that party fails to comply 
without  good  cause  with  rulings  on  requests  for  information,  documents,  or

admissions.    An  adverse  inference  may  be  appropriate  where  the  information  is 
solely in the control of that party.  Similarly, if a party fails to provide an adequate 
explanation  for the failure to  respond fully and  in  a timely manner  to a  request, 
the  Administrative  Judge  may  impose  sanctions.    Adverse  inferences  are 
appropriate  when  the  information  is  solely  in  the  control  of  that  party.    These 
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the authority to:  

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

draw  an  adverse  inference  that  the  requested  information  would  have 
reflected  unfavorably  on  the  party  refusing  to  provide  the  requested 
information; 

consider  the  issues  to  which  the  requested  information  pertains  to  be 
established in favor of the opposing party; 

exclude  other  evidence  offered  by  the  party  failing  to  produce  the 
requested information; and/or 

recommend that a decision be entered in favor of the opposing party.4

B. 

Use of Agency Resources and Facilities by Class Agent 

The  class  agent  and  his/her  non-attorney  representative  should  be  permitted 
reasonable  access  to  and/or  use  of  agency  facilities  (copiers,  telephones, 
computers, internet, fax machines, email, printers, etc.) for preparation of the case 
as  long  as  there  is  no  undue  disruption  of  agency  operations.    The  class  agent 
and/or non-attorney representative may not use agency resources and facilities in 
the  preparation  of  the  class  case  without  obtaining  the  prior  approval  of  the 
designated agency official. 

4  The  Administrative  Judge’s  order  to  the  parties  should  make  clear  what  sanctions  or  other 
actions may be imposed for a failure to comply with the order within the time set forth therein.  Where an 
order did not put a party on notice that it could be sanctioned for a noncompliance or did not put the party 
on notice of the type of sanction that the Administrative Judge now seeks to impose, the Administrative 
Judge must issue a notice to show cause to the party for an explanation why the sanction should not be 
imposed and provide an opportunity to cure the noncompliance before imposing the sanction.

VIII.   RESOLUTION - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(g) 

A. 

Resolution by the Parties 

The complaint may be resolved by agreement of the agency and the agent at any 
time  pursuant  to  the  notice  and  approval  procedure  contained  in  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.204(g)(4). 

B. 

Notice of Proposed Resolution 

If a resolution is proposed, notice must be given to all class members in the same 
manner as the notification of certification of the class was given.  The notice must 
include a copy of the proposed resolution, set out the relief, if any, that the agency 
will grant, and inform the class members that the resolution will bind all members 
of  the  class.    The  notice  must  also  inform  class  members  of  the  right  to  submit 
objections  to  the  settlement.    The  notice  further  must  inform  the  parties  of  the 
name and address of the Administrative Judge assigned to the complaint. 

The  agency  shall provide the Administrative Judge with  a  copy of  the proposed 
resolution and the notice sent to the parties. 

C. 

Administrative Judge Shall Review Resolution 

1. 

2. 

The Administrative Judge shall review and issue a decision concerning the 
fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of the proposed resolution.  Within 
thirty  (30) days of  the  date of  a  class  member’s receipt of the notice of 
proposed  resolution,  the  class  member  may  file  a  petition  with  the 
Administrative  Judge  noting  objections  to  the  settlement  if  the  petitioner 
(class member) believes that the settlement benefits only the class agent or 
is otherwise not fair, adequate, and reasonable to the class as a whole.  The 
Administrative  Judge  will  review  the  proposed  resolution  after  the 
expiration  of  the  30-day  period  allowed  for  petitions  and  consider  any 
petitions received.   If the judge determines that the resolution is not fair, 
adequate,  and  reasonable,  s/he  will  vacate  the  proposed  resolution  and 
may replace the class agent with the petitioner or other class member who 
is eligible to serve as class agent. 

An Administrative Judge’s decision that a resolution is not fair, adequate, 
and  reasonable  vacates  the  agreement  between  the  class  agent  and  the 
agency.    The  decision  must  inform  the  class  agent,  the  petitioner,  class 
members,  and  the  agency  of  the  right  to  appeal  the  decision  to  the 
Commission.    The  decision  must  include  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,

Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).  The agency may use the separate 
form at Appendix O for filing its appeal with the Commission. 

3. 

An Administrative Judge’s decision that a resolution is fair, adequate, and 
reasonable binds all members of the class.  The decision must inform the 
petitioner  of  the  right  to  appeal  the  decision  to  the  Commission.    The 
decision  must 
include  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of 
Appeal/Petition (Appendix P). 

IX.  HEARING - 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.204(h) and (i) 

A. 

Hearing Procedures 

Hearing procedures in certified class complaints are the same as those applied to 
hearings  in  individual  complaints  of  discrimination  and  are  set  out  in  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109.  

B. 

Site of the Class Hearing 

The Administrative Judge assigned to hear the certified class complaint will, upon 
expiration of the period allowed for preparation of the class case, set a date for a 
hearing  and  determine  the  site  of  the  hearing.    Within  his/her  discretion,  the 
Administrative  Judge  is  authorized  to  conduct  the  hearing  in  the  Commission 
district office, in a Commission area or local office, at the agency’s organizational 
component  where  the  complaint  arose,  or  at  such  other  location  as  s/he  may 
determine appropriate.  In determining the hearing site, the Administrative Judge 
should  consider  factors  such  as  the  location  of  the  parties;  the  location  of  the 
Commission  district,  area,  and  local  offices;  the  number  and  location  of 
witnesses; the  location of records; travel distances for the Administrative Judge, 
the  parties,  and  witnesses; 
the  availability  of  sources  of 
transportation; and other factors as may be appropriate. 

travel  costs; 

Should  an  agency  desire  that  a  hearing  be  held  at  a  location  within  the 
jurisdictional area of another Commission district office, it must submit a request, 
in writing, to the Commission office that determined the class certification issue.  
In its request, the agency must identify the location of the desired place of hearing 
and must set out, in detail, its reasons and justification for the requested change.  
The Administrative Judge will rule  on the  request  only after  the directors  of the 
concerned Commission district offices have conferred on the matter.

Travel Expenses 

August, 2015 

If the Administrative Judge sets a hearing site that is outside the local commuting 
area  of  the  agency’s  organizational  component  where  the  complaint  arose,  the 
agency  must  bear  all  reasonable  travel  and  per  diem  expenses  of  class  agents, 
their  authorized  representatives,  agency  representatives,  and  all  witnesses 
approved  by  the  Administrative  Judge,  except  that  an  agency  does  not  have  the 
authority  to  pay  the  travel  expenses  of  complainant’s  witnesses  who  are  not 
federal employees. 

The  agency’s  obligation  is  limited  to  those  costs  which  are  legally  payable  in 
advance  by  the  agency.    See  Expenses  of  Outside  Applicant/Complainant  to 
Travel to Agency EEO Hearing, File: B-202845, 61 Comp. Gen. 654 (1982); see 
also    John  Booth  (  Travel  Expenses  of  Witness  (  Agency  Responsible,  File:  B-
235845, 69 Comp. Gen. 310 (1990).  

D. 

Official Time for Agency Employees 

Any employee testifying at a hearing is entitled to official time for the time s/he 
spends testifying as well as a reasonable amount of time for travel to and from the 
hearing.   The  class agent and agent’s representative, if employees of the agency 
where  the  complaint  arose  and  was  filed,  are  entitled  to  official  time  for  actual 
time spent at the hearing and for a reasonable amount of time spent preparing for 
the hearing. 

An  agency  may  permit  its  employees  to  use  official  time  in  preparing  and 
presenting a class complaint which arose in another agency.  

X. 

ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE’S DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE 
CLASS COMPLAINT 

The Administrative Judge shall transmit his/her decision on the complaint to the parties.  
If  there  is  a  finding  of  discrimination,  the  decision  shall  include  systemic  relief  for  the 
class, and any individual relief, where appropriate, with regard to the personnel action or 
policy that gave rise to the complaint.  The decision shall be sent to the agency together 
with the entire record, including the transcript.  

If the Administrative Judge finds no class relief  appropriate, s/he shall determine if any 
finding of individual discrimination is warranted and, if so, shall issue a decision on the 
appropriate relief to be provided by the agency.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(i).

XI.  AGENCY FINAL ACTIONS - 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.204(j) and (k) 

A. 

Action on Administrative Judge’s Decision  

Within  sixty  (60)  days  of  receipt  of  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision,  the 
agency  must  issue  a  final  order  either  fully  implementing  or  simultaneously 
appealing the  Administrative Judge’s decision.   If the agency  does not  issue the 
final  order  within  sixty  (60)  days  of  receipt  of  the  Administrative  Judge's 
decision,  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  becomes  the  final  action  of  the 
agency.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(j)(2). 

The agency must transmit its final order to the class agent within five days of the 
expiration of the 60-day period. 

B. 

Agency Final Action Requirements 

The agency’s final order on a class complaint must be in writing; notify the class 
agent whether the agency will fully implement the decision of the Administrative 
Judge;  and  contain  a  notice  of  the  right  to  appeal  to  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission, the right to file a  civil action, and the applicable time 
limits.    If  the  final  order  does  not  fully  implement  the  decision  of  the 
Administrative  Judge,  the  agency  shall  simultaneously  file  an  appeal  in 
accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.403  and  append  a  copy  of  the  appeal  to  the 
final order.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(j)(1). 

Binding Nature of Agency Final Action Implementing Administrative Judge’s 

C. 
Decision 

The final agency action implementing the Administrative Judge’s decision finding 
discrimination will be binding on all members of the class and on the agency.  A 
final agency action implementing the Administrative Judge’s decision finding no 
discrimination  is  not  binding  on  a  class  member’s  individual  complaint.    Class 
members  may  not Aopt out@ of  the class action while it is pending.  See  Section 
V.C of this Chapter.

Notification of Agency Final Action 

The  agency  shall  notify  class  members  and  the  class  representative  of  its  final 
action  through  the  same  media  employed  to  give  notice  of  the  existence  of  the 
class  complaint.    The  notice,  where  appropriate,  shall  include  information 
concerning  the  rights  of  class  members  to  seek  individual  relief  and  of  the 
procedures to be followed.  Notice shall be given by  the agency within ten (10) 
days of the transmittal of its final action to the agent. 

XII.  RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUAL CLASS MEMBERS - 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(l) 

A. 

Claims for Individual Relief by Class Members Where Discrimination Is Found 

Where a finding of discrimination against a class is made, there is a presumption 
of discrimination as to each member of the class.  The agency has the burden of 
proving  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  a  class  member  is  not  entitled  to 
relief.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(l)(3). 

Within  thirty  (30)  days  of  receipt  of  notification  of  the  final  agency  action 
implementing the Administrative Judge’s decision, a class member who believes 
that s/he is entitled to individual relief must file a written claim with the head of 
the agency, or with the agency’s EEO Director. 

The claim must include a specific, detailed showing that: 

1. 

2. 

The  claimant  is  a  class  member  who  was  affected  by  the  discriminatory 
policy or practice; and  

The discriminatory action occurred within the period of time for which the 
Administrative Judge found class-wide discrimination in his/her decision. 

B. 

Timing of Agency Decision on Individual Claims for Relief 

Within  ninety  (90)  calendar  days  of  receiving  an  individual  claim,  the  agency 
must  issue  a  final  decision  on  that  claim.    The  agency’s  final  decision  must 
include a notice of the right to file an appeal or a civil action within the applicable 
time  limits.    The  decision  must  include  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of 
Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).

C. 

Oversight of Individual Claims for Relief 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Where  an  Administrative  Judge  finds  that  the  agency  discriminated 
against the class, the Administrative Judge should include in his/her order 
a  provision  that  establishes  a  mechanism  for  review  of  individual  claims 
pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.204(l)(3).    Under  that  section,  a  class 
member  must  file  a  claim  with  the  agency  within  thirty  (30)  days  of 
his/her  receipt  of  notification  from  the  agency  of  its  final  order  and  the 
agency must issue a final order within ninety (90) days of its receipt of the 
claim.    That  section  further  provides  that  Administrative  Judges  retain 
jurisdiction over the complaint in order to resolve any disputed claims of 
class members and may hold hearings or otherwise supplement the record 
on a claim filed by a class member. 

To implement this section, an Administrative Judge’s order should advise 
the  agency  to  inform  him/her  in  writing  within  sixty  (60)  days  of  the 
agency’s receipt of a claim from a class member that it intends to dispute 
the class member’s claim, and provide a  copy of such notice to the class 
member.  Once the agency informs the Administrative Judge and the class 
member  of 
the 
Administrative Judge will issue an order tolling the 90-day period within 
which  the  agency  is  required  to  issue  a  decision  on  the  class  member=s

The  Administrative  Judge’s  order  will  advise  the  agency  to  provide  a 
statement  in  support  of  its  decision  to  dispute  the  class  member’s  claim 
and  any  supporting  evidence  within  fifteen  (15)  days  of  the  agency’s 
receipt of the Administrative Judge’s order, providing a copy of any such 
submission  to  the  class  member.    The  class  member  will  have  15  days 
from  the  date  of  service  of  the  agency’s  submission  to  respond  to  the 
agency’s submission and may file a statement and documents in support of 
his/her claim, providing a copy of any such submission to the agency.  If 
service  of  the  submission  was  by  mail,  the  class  member  may  add  three 
days  to  the  date  that  the  response  is  due.    The  Administrative  Judge  has 
the discretion to enlarge the 15-day period at the written request of either 
party or on his/her own motion.  If a party seeks an enlargement of the 15-
day  period,  that  party  must  provide  a  copy  of  its  written  request  to  the 
other party.

The  Administrative  Judge  thereafter  may  determine  whether  s/he  needs 
additional information or should hold a hearing in order to further develop 
the record regarding the class member’s claim.  At the conclusion of fact 
finding,  the  Administrative  Judge  will  issue  a  decision  concerning  the 
class  member’s  claim  and  forward  the  decision  to  the  class  member  and

the agency.  The decision will advise the agency that the 90-day period for 
issuing  a  final  order  on  the  claim  will  resume  upon  its  receipt  of  the 
Administrative  Judge’s  decision.    The  agency  must  issue  a  final  order 
regarding  the  class  member=s  claim  within  the  90-day  period.    If  the 
agency  does  not  issue  the  final  order  within  the  90-day  period,  the 
Administrative Judge’s decision will become the final order of the agency. 

5. 

The agency’s final action on a class member’s claim must inform the class 
member  of  the  right  to  appeal  the  decision  to  the  Office  of  Federal 
Operations or to file a civil action, and it must include EEOC Form 573, 
Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).  

D. 

Limits on the Duration of a Finding of Class-Wide Discrimination 

The  agency  or  the  Commission  may  find  class-wide  discrimination  and  order 
remedial action for any policy or practice in existence within forty-five (45) days 
of  the  class  agent’s  initial  contact  with  the  EEO  Counselor.    Relief  may  be 
ordered  for  the  time  the  policy  or  practice  was  in  effect.    Under  the  pattern  of 
discrimination theory, incidents occurring earlier than 45 days before contact with 
the  EEO  Counselor  must  also  be  remedied  provided  the  initial  contact  with  the 
EEO  Counselor  was  timely  and  the  earlier  incidents  were  part  of  the  same 
continuing policy or practice found to have been discriminatory.  Where  contact 
with  the  EEO  Counselor  is  timely  as  to  one  of  the  events  comprising  the 
continuing  violation,  then  the  counseling  contact  is  timely  as  to  the  entire 
violation.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(l)(3).  This 45-day time period does not limit 
the two-year time period for which back pay can be recovered by a class member. 

E.  Where Class-Wide Discrimination Is Not Found 

The  agency  shall,  within  sixty  (60)  calendar  days  of  issuance  of  the  final 
decision, acknowledge receipt of an individual complaint as required in 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.106(d)  and  process  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subpart  A  each 
individual complaint that was subsumed into the class complaint. 

If it is found that the class agent or any other member of the class is a victim of 
discrimination, the relief provisions of 29 C.F.R. § 1614.501 shall apply.

XIII.  REPRISAL 

EEO MD-110 

Federal  employees  who  are  agents,  claimants,  representatives  of  agents  or  claimants, 
witnesses, or agency officials having responsibility for processing class complaints may 
file  individual  discrimination  complaints  if  they  believe  they  have  been  subjected  to 
restraint,  interference,  coercion,  or  reprisal  because  of  their  involvement  in  the 
presentation  and/or  processing  of  a  class  complaint.    EEO  counseling  must  precede  the 
filing of such complaints. 

Retaliation  claims  can  be  the  subject  of  class  actions  where  the  plaintiffs  establish  a 
general practice of retaliation against employees who oppose discriminatory practices or 
exercise rights protected under Title VII.  See, Holsey v. Armour & Co., 743 F.2d 199, 
216-217 (4th Cir. 1984), cert denied, 470 U.S. 1028 (1985).  The Commission has held 
that  reprisal  is  an  appropriate  basis  for  a  class  when  there  is  a  showing  that  specific 
reprisal actions were taken against a group of people for challenging agency policies, or 
where  reprisal  was  routinely  visited  on  the  class  members.    See  Levitoff  v.  Dep’t.  of 
Agriculture,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01913685  (Mar.  17,  1992),  request  to  reopen  denied, 
EEOC Request No. 05920601 (Sept. 10, 1992); as cited in Powell, et. al. v. Dep’t. of the

CHAPTER 9  
APPEALS TO THE COMMISSION 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Sections 1614.401(a)-(e) of 29 C.F.R. identify those entitled to file appeals to the Commission.  
29 C.F.R. § 1614.402(a) provides that appeals to the Commission must be filed by complainant 
within thirty (30) days1
 of receipt of an agency’s final action - that is, a dismissal, final agency 
decision  (FAD),  final  order,  or  final  determination.    If  an  attorney  of  record  represents  the 
complainant, the 30-day time limit shall begin to run from the date of receipt by the attorney of 
the  agency’s  final  action.    If  an  agency  determines  not  to  implement  the  decision  of  an 
Administrative Judge either in full or in part, it must notify the complainant of its determination 
in  a  final  order  issued  within  forty  (40)  days  of  its  receipt  of  the  Administrative  Judge’s 
decision  and  it  must  simultaneously  file  an  appeal  with  the  Commission,  in  a  digital  format 
acceptable  to  the  Commission,  absent  a  good  showing  why  the  agency  cannot  submit  digital 
records.    See  Chapter  6,  Section  VIII  for  more  information  on  what  constitutes  good  cause 
shown.    The  complainant  may  file  an  appeal  with  the  Commission  in  either  a  digital  format 
acceptable  to  the  Commission  or  by  mail.    For  information  regarding  appeals  submissions  see 
Section IV of this Chapter. 

The complainant shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the agency at the same time it is filed with 
the Commission.  In or attached to the appeal to the Commission, the complainant must certify 
the date and method by which service was made on the agency. 

The individual complainant should use EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition.  A copy of 
the  Form  is  attached  as  Appendix  P  to  this  Management  Directive.    The  agency  shall  attach  a 
copy  of  EEOC  Form  573  to  all  final  actions  and  dismissals  of  equal  employment  complaints.   
The  Commission  has  prepared  a  separate  form  that  agencies  may  use  to  file  appeals  with  the 
Commission.  A copy of that form is attached as Appendix O. 

1 All time limits stated in this Management Directive are in calendar days.  The time limits in Part 
1614  are  subject  to  waiver,  estoppels,  and  equitable  tolling.    29  C.F.R.  §  1614.604(c).    For  further 
guidance, see EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 2 “Threshold Issues,” IV-D, Timeliness.

II.   ADVISING THE PARTIES OF THEIR APPEAL RIGHTS 

A. 

Rights Following Administrative Judge Issuance of a Decision 

1. Merits/Class Certification Cases 

a. 

b. 

In a decision on the merits of a non-class complaint or concerning 
the issue of certification of a class action, the Administrative Judge 
shall advise the parties that the agency has forty (40) days from the 
date of its receipt of the Administrative Judge’s decision to review 
the  decision  and  to  take  final  action  on  the  decision  by  issuing  a 
final order.  The 40-day period within which the agency must take 
final  action  does  not  commence  until  the  Administrative  Judge 
issues  an  order  advising  the  agency  that  the  decision  of  the 
Administrative Judge is the final decision and that the agency must 
take  final  action  within  40  days  of  its  receipt  thereof.    Where  an 
Administrative Judge issues a decision finding discrimination, the 
40-day  period  will  not  commence  until  the  Administrative  Judge 
issues a final decision regarding remedies and attorney’s fees.2

In a decision on the merits of a class complaint, the Administrative 
Judge  shall  advise  the  parties  that  the  agency  has  sixty  (60)  days 
from the date of its receipt of the Administrative Judge’s decision 
to review the decision  and to take final  action  on  the decision by 
issuing a final order.  The 60-day period within which the agency 
must take final action does not commence until the Administrative 
Judge issues an order advising the agency that the decision of the 
Administrative Judge is the final decision and that the agency must 
take final action within 60 days of its receipt thereof.3

c.  

The  Administrative  Judge  should  inform  the  complainant  of  the 
following: 

2  If  service  of  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  was  by  mail  without  the  use  of  certified 
mail/return receipt, the agency may add five days to the date that the final action is due.  This rule, adding 
five days to the date of service, shall apply in all instances where the party being served has the right to 
take  an  action  within  a  period  of  time  following  such  service,  except  where  the  serving  party  uses 
certified mail/return receipt and can establish the date of actual receipt. 

3  Due  to  the  potential  complexity  of  class  complaints  that  proceed  through  litigation,  the  60-day 
period  is  intended  to  provide  agencies  adequate  time  to  review  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  on 
liability and relief.

receives  the  agency’s  final  order  to  file  an  appeal  of  the 
final order. 

the  agency’s  failure  to  take  final  action  by  issuing  a  final

where  the  agency’s  final  action/final  order  advises  the 
complainant  that  the  agency  has  determined  not  to  fully 
implement the Administrative Judge’s decision, the agency 
must file an appeal of the Administrative Judge’s decision 
simultaneously  with  notifying  the  complainant  of  its 
determination  (providing  the  complainant  with  a  copy  of 
the  appeal)  and  advise  the  complainant  of  his/her  right  to 
file  a  separate  appeal  of  the  Administrative  Judge’s 
decision within 30 days of the complainant=s receipt of the 
agency’s final order. 

2.  

Procedural Dismissal 

When  the  Administrative  Judge  issues  a  procedural  dismissal,  s/he  must 
advise the complainant that the complainant will have the right to file an 
appeal  of  the  agency’s  final  order  within  30  days  of  the  complainant’s 
receipt thereof. 

3.  

Class Action Settlement Agreements 

A  petition  to  vacate  a  resolution  may  be  filed  with  the  Administrative 
Judge asserting that the resolution favors only the class agent or is not fair, 
adequate,  and  reasonable  to  the  class  as  a  whole.    An  Administrative 
Judge’s decision that a class action settlement agreement is fair, adequate, 
and reasonable binds all members of the class.  The decision must inform 
the petitioner of the right to appeal the decision to the Commission.  The

An Administrative Judge’s decision that a resolution is not fair, adequate, 
and  reasonable  vacates  the  agreement  between  the  class  agent  and  the 
agency.    The  decision  must  inform  the  class  agent,  the  petitioner,  class 
members,  and  the  agency,  of  the  right  to  appeal  the  decision  to  the 
Commission.    The  decision  must  include  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573, 
Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).  The agency may use the separate 
form at Appendix O for filing its appeal with the Commission. 

B. 

Agency Final Action 

1.  

Agency Final Action 

An  agency  final  action  involves  agency  issuance  of  a  final  order  to  the 
complainant.  The final order informs the complainant whether the agency 
will fully implement the decision of the Administrative Judge and contains 
notice of the complainant’s right to appeal to the Commission.  The term 
“fully implement” means that the agency adopts without modification the 
decision of the Administrative Judge.   If the agency’s final order advises 
the  complainant that  the agency will  not  fully implement the decision of 
the  Administrative Judge,  the  agency  must  file  an  appeal  of  the  decision 
with  the  Commission  simultaneously  with  issuing  the  final  order  to  the 
complainant.  In this way, an agency will take final action on a complaint 
referred to an Administrative Judge by issuing a final order, but it will not 
be provided with the opportunity of introducing new evidence or writing a 
new decision in the case.  The agency may use the form attached hereto as 
Appendix O to file its appeal with the Commission.  Whether the agency’s 
final  order  advises  the  complainant  that  the  agency  will  or  will  not  fully 
implement the Administrative Judge’s  decision,  the agency  must  provide 
the  complainant  with  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of 
Appeal/Petition (Appendix P). 

2.  

Notice of Rights 

a.  

Full Implementation 

Where  the  agency  issues  a  final  order  in  which  it  agrees  to  fully 
implement  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision,  the  order  must 
inform the complainant that s/he has the right to file an appeal of 
the Administrative Judge=s decision and agency’s final order.  

The agency further must inform the complainant that s/he must file 
an  appeal  within  30  days  of  his/her  receipt  of  the  agency’s  final 
order and the agency must provide the complainant with a copy of 
EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).

Less than Full Implementation 

Where the agency issues a final order through which it informs the 
complainant  that  it  does  not  intend  to  fully  implement  the 
Administrative  Judge’s  final  decision,  the  agency’s  final  order 
must inform the complainant that the agency, simultaneously with 
the  issuance  of  its  final  order  to  the  complainant,  has  filed  an

The  agency  must  provide  the  complainant  with  a  copy  of  the

following: 

(1)  the  complainant  may  file  a  separate  appeal  of  the 
agency’s final order;  

(2) the Commission, as a general rule and in the absence of 
a  separate  appeal  from  the  complainant,  will  review  only 
the 
the  agency’s  decision  not

(3)  if  the  complainant  contends  that  the  Administrative 
Judge erred either in any rulings made during the pendency 
of the action or in the decision, the complainant must file a 
separate  appeal  from  the  agency’s  final  order  to  challenge 
such errors.   

The final order must inform the complainant that any such appeal 
must  be  filed  within  30  days  of  the  complainant’s  receipt  of  the 
final  order,  and  the  agency  must  provide  the  complainant  with  a 
copy of EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P). 

C. 

Agency Final Decision 

In  any  case  where  the  agency  issues  a  final  decision  (for  example,  where  the 
complainant elects to have the agency issue a final decision following completion 
of the investigation), the agency must inform the complainant of his/her right to 
file an appeal with the Commission and provide the complainant with a copy of 
EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of  Appeal/Petition  (Appendix  P).    The  agency  further 
must inform the complainant that any such appeal must be filed within 30 days of 
complainant’s receipt of the agency’s final decision.

Agency Procedural Decision 

August, 2015 

Where the agency issues a decision dismissing a complaint in its entirety pursuant 
to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.107(a),  the  agency  must  inform  the  complainant  of  his/her 
right to file an appeal with the Commission and provide  the complainant with a 
copy of EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition (Appendix P).  The agency 
further must inform the complainant that any such appeal must be filed within 30 
days of complainant’s receipt of the agency’s dismissal decision. 

E.  Mixed Case Complaints 

The  agency  must  advise  the  complainant  that  s/he  may  appeal  a  final  agency 
decision on a mixed case complaint by filing the appeal with the Merit Systems 
Protection  Board  (not  the  Commission).    The  agency  further  must  inform  the 
complainant that any such appeal must be filed within 30 days of his/her receipt 
of  the  agency’s  decision.    For  a  fuller  discussion  concerning  the  processing  of 
mixed cases, see Chapter 4, Section II of this Management Directive. 

III.  PERSONS WHO MAY APPEAL 

The  Commission’s  regulations  governing  appeals  to  the  Commission  are  located  at 
subpart  D  of  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614.    Section  1614.401  of  29  C.F.R.  sets  out  who  may 
appeal  to  the  Commission  when  an  issue  of  employment  discrimination  is  raised  either 
alone or in connection with a grievance, settlement, or a Merit Systems Protection Board 
(MSPB) claim.

§ 1614.107(a); 2) a final order from the agency stating whether it will fully implement the decision of the 
Administrative  Judge,  see  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.110(a);  3)  a  final  agency  decision  on  the  merits  of  the 
complaint  where  the  complainant  requested  an  immediate  final  decision  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108(f);  or  4)  an  agency’s  final  determination  on  its  alleged  noncompliance  with  a  settlement

further provide that the agency must file an appeal with the Commission at the same time it serves the 
final order on the complainant following receipt of a decision from an Administrative Judge where it does 
not intend to fully implement the decision.  The agency’s filing of an appeal of an Administrative Judge’s 
decision that it does not intend to fully implement will result in the Commission’s review of the agency’s 
decision  not  to  fully  implement  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision.    The  complainant  need  not  file  a 
separate appeal to have the Commission review the agency’s actions.  Where, however, the complainant

or in the decision, the complainant would need to file an appeal from the agency’s final order to challenge 
such errors. 

If an agency fails to take any action during the 40-day period, the Administrative Judge’s decision 
would be deemed ratified and the complainant would be entitled to file an appeal of the Administrative 
Judge’s decision as ratified after the expiration of the 40-day period.  The agency would not be permitted 
to cross-appeal or challenge any aspect of the Administrative Judge’s decision in this situation. 

5  If  the  agency  issues  a  final  order  to  the  complainant  stating  that  it  does  not  intend  to  fully 
implement the decision of the Administrative Judge but fails to file an appeal, the agency’s final order has 
no effect on the Administrative Judge’s decision.  If the agency fails properly to issue a final order and 
file an appeal simultaneously with the issuance of the order, the Administrative Judge’s decision will be 
deemed  ratified  by  the  agency  upon  the  expiration  of  the  agency’s  40-day  period  for  accepting  or  not 
accepting the Administrative Judge’s decision. 

6 Included is a dismissal of a complaint that does not meet the prerequisites of a class complaint as 
enumerated in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.204(a)(2) where the decision to dismiss informs the class agent that the 
complaint is being filed as an individual complaint.  The Office of Federal Operations, Appellate Review 
Programs, will provide expedited consideration (within 90 days of receipt of appeal) of class complaints

IV.  FILING THE APPEAL AND RESPONSE 

A. 

How to Appeal 

1. 

The complainant, agent, grievant or individual class claimant (hereinafter 
appellant) must file an appeal by mailing the appeal to: 

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
Office of Federal Operations  
P.O. Box 77960 
Washington, DC 20013  
Fax: (202) 663-7022 

As  an  alternative  the  appeal  may  be  submitted  through  facsimile  or  the 
Commission’s electronic document submission portal. 

The  complainant  should  use  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of  Appeal/Petition  – 
Complainant (Appendix P) and should indicate what is being appealed. 

2. 

Unless  it  has  shown  good  cause  why  it  is  unable  to  do  so,9
,  the  agency 
must file an appeal with the Commission in digital format, either by using 
the Commission’s electronic document submission portal or by some other 
approved method.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.403(g).  The agency may file its

Federal Operations identifying why they cannot meet the digital filing requirements and when they expect 
to be able to meet the digital filing requirements.

appeal by using the form appended hereto at Appendix O to file its appeal 
with the Commission and/or by providing the Commission with a copy of 
the order it sends to the complainant.  

3. 

Where  an  agency  files  an  appeal  simultaneously  with  providing  the 
complainant  with  a  final  order  indicating  that  it  does  not  intend  to  fully 
implement the decision of the Administrative Judge, the complainant need 
not  file  a  separate  appeal  as  a  prerequisite  to  Commission  review  of  the 
propriety  of  the  agency’s  decision  not  to  implement  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision.  If, however, the complainant believes that other issues 
presented in his/her complaint and addressed by the Administrative Judge 
were  wrongly  decided,  or 
the 
Administrative Judge’s decision contained errors, the complainant should 
file  an  appeal  from  the  agency’s  final  order  in  order  to  ensure  that  the 
Commission will address these issues as well.  Although the Commission 
has the right to review all of the issues in a complaint on appeal, it also has 
the  discretion not to do  so and  may  focus  only  on  the  issues  specifically 
raised on appeal.

B. 

Service of Notice of Appeal 

The complainant on appeal shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the agency at the 
same  time  it  is  filed  with  the  Commission.    In  or  attached  to  the  appeal  to  the 
Commission, the complainant must certify the date and method by which service 
was made on the agency. 

The agency must certify to the Commission that it has provided the complainant 
with a copy of the order in which it advised the complainant that it did not intend 
to  fully  implement  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision,  that  it  informed  the 
complainant  of  his/her  right  to  file  an  appeal  of  its  decision  and  provided  the 
complainant  with  information  as  to  how  s/he  may  file  an  appeal,  and  that  it 
provided  the  complainant  with  a  copy  of  EEOC  Form  573,  Notice  of 
Appeal/Petition (Appendix P). 

C. 

Appeal Will Be Acknowledged 

OFO  will  docket  and  acknowledge  in  writing  the  receipt  of  an  appeal.    Where 
both  the  agency  and  the  complainant  file  appeals  based  on  the  same  complaint 
following the agency’s issuance of an order stating that it does not intend to fully 
implement  the  decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge,  the  Commission  shall 
consolidate the appeals under a single Commission Appeal No. and consider both 
appeals simultaneously.

D. 

Dismissal of Appeal 

EEO MD-110  

If a party files an appeal beyond the applicable time limits, the Commission may 
dismiss  the  appeal.    The  agency  should  advise  the  complainant  in  its  dismissal 
decision or final order that if s/he files his/her appeal beyond the thirty (30)-day 
period  set  forth  in  the  Commission’s  regulations,  s/he  should  provide  an 
explanation as to why his/her appeal should be accepted despite its untimeliness.  
If the complainant cannot explain why his/her untimeliness should be excused in 
accordance  with  29 C.F.R.  § 1614.604,  the  Commission  may  dismiss  the  appeal 
as untimely. 

E. 

Briefs and Supporting Documents 

The complainant may file a brief or statement in support of his/her appeal with the 
Office of Federal Operations.  The optional brief or statement must be filed within 
thirty (30) days of filing the notice of appeal and a copy of it must be sent to the 
other party. 

The agency may file a brief or statement in support of its final action.  The brief 
or  statement  must  be  filed  within  twenty  (20)  days  of  filing  its  appeal,  and  in 
accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.403(g),  must  be  filed  in  a  digital  format 
acceptable to the Commission (see Appendix L). 

F. 

Statements in Opposition to an Appeal 

Any statement or brief in opposition to an appeal must be submitted to OFO and 
served on the opposing party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the statement or 
brief  supporting  the  appeal.    Where  both  the  complainant  and  the  agency  file 
appeals and briefs or statements in support of their appeals, both parties may file 
statements in opposition to the appeal of the other party.  If no brief or statement 
supporting  the  appeal  is  filed,  the  party  opposing  the  appeal  must  file  its 
opposition within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the appeal.   

G. 

Submission of Case File 

Absent notice from the Commission that it has the case file from the hearing on 
the same matter, the agency must submit the complaint file to OFO within thirty 
(30) days of notification that the complainant has filed an appeal or within thirty 
(30)  days  of  submission  of  an  appeal  by  the  agency.    If  the  complaint  was 
adjudicated by an Administrative Judge, the complaint file must include copies of 
all documents issued by or served on the Administrative Judge, including, but not 
limited to, all correspondence to and from the Administrative Judge, orders from

the Administrative Judge, and motions and briefs of the parties.  Agencies should 
develop internal procedures that will ensure the prompt submission of complaint 
files  upon  a  determination  not  to  fully  implement  an  Administrative  Judge’s 
decision or notice that a complainant has filed an appeal. 

The  agency  must  submit  appeals  and  complete  complaint  case  file(s)  to  the 
Commission’s  Office  of  Federal  Operations  in  a  digital  format  unless  they  can 
show  good  cause  for  not  doing  so.    Complainants  and  their  representative(s),  if 
applicable, are strongly encouraged to file all documents in a digital format.  See, 
29 C.F.R.  §1614.403(g).    All  documents  may  be  uploaded  to  the  Commission’s 
electronic  document  submission  portal.    If  a  CD  is  used,  it  is  preferred  that  all 
documents be provided in a PDF format. 

The electronic complaint file must at a minimum have the following features: 

• 

• 

Electronic bookmarks corresponding to the file index and section dividers 
of the paper file, if a paper file was created;

Sequentially  numbered  pages  starting  with  the  first  page  of  the  file.    All 
pages  in  the  report  of  investigation  must  be  accounted  for  in  the  page 
the  cover  page  and  any 
numbering  of 
administrative  documents,  in  order  for  the  numbers  in  the  paper  file  to 
match precisely the numbers in the electronic file.  An individual entering 
page number 150 into Adobe Acrobat should come to the exact same page 
as  an  individual  turning  to  page  150  of  the  paper  file.    Administrative

Signatures on Electronic Documents 

It  is  the  Commission’s  policy  to  support,  encourage,  and  in  the  case  of  agency 
submissions on appeal, mandate the use of digital documents in lieu of paper for 
documentation  sent  to  the  Commission  specifically  under  the  authority  of 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.403(g).  A digital document used by a person, agency, or other 
entity  shall  have  the  same  force  and  effect  as  those  documents  not  produced  by 
electronic means. 

In support of the policy, the Commission considers electronic signatures on such 
submissions  as  having  the  same  force  and  effect  as  signatures  and  records 
produced  by  hand  or  other  non-electronic  means.    “Electronic  signature”  means 
any  digital  symbol,  sound,  or  process  attached  to  or  logically  associated  with  a 
digital  record  and  executed  or  adopted  by  a  person  with  the  intent  to  sign  the 
record.    The  Commission  will  accept  an  array  of  digital  objects  to  serve  as  an

example,  “/s/Jane  Doe”),  a  graphical  image  of  a  handwritten  signature,  or  an 
authenticated process that creates an electronic signature.  An electronic signature 
is  considered  attached  to  or  logically  associated  with  a  digital  record  if  the 
electronic signature is linked to the record during transmission and storage.

APPELLATE PROCEDURE 

A.  Where Record Is Complete 

Where  the  record  is  complete,  OFO  shall  issue  a  decision  in  accordance  with 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.405. 

B.  Where Record Requires Supplementation 

While the Commission retains the right to supplement the record on appeal, it is 
intended  that  this  right  will  be  exercised  only  in  rare  instances  to  avoid  a 
miscarriage of justice. 

1. 

2. 

Where  the  record  requires  supplementation,  OFO  may  require  additional 
information  from  one  or  both  of  the  parties.    OFO  may  supplement  the 
record by an exchange of letters, memoranda, or investigation.  Each party 
shall provide copies of such supplemental information to the other party at 
the time it is submitted to OFO.  

Where the  record  is so incomplete as  to require  remand to the  agency in 
order to complete the investigation, the Commission shall designate a time 
period between thirty (30) and ninety (90) days within which the agency 
must complete the investigation.  During the period of remand, the appeal 
will  be  held  in  abeyance  and  the  complaint  will  be  monitored  by  OFO.   
Upon  completion  of  the  investigation,  the  agency  must  provide  the 
complainant  with  a  copy  of  its  supplemental  record  and  findings  and 
return  the  completed  record  to  OFO.    The  complainant  may,  within 
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the supplemental record, submit a statement 
concerning  the  supplemental  record  to  OFO.    Upon  receipt  by  OFO,  the 
supplemental record will be included in the appeal file and the appeal will 
be processed appropriately.

Sanctions 

August, 2015 

Absent good cause shown, there is no legitimate basis for either party to an appeal 
to fail to comply with the appellate procedures in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.404 or to fail 
to respond fully and in a timely fashion to a request for information.  Accordingly, 
where  either  party  to  an  appeal  fails  to  comply  with  the  appellate  procedures  in 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.404 or fails to respond fully and in a timely fashion to requests 
for

circumstances, impose any of the following sanctions:

draw  an  adverse  inference  that  the  requested  information  would  have 
reflected  unfavorably  on  the  party  refusing  to  provide  the  requested 
information;10

consider  the  matters  to  which  the  requested  information  or  testimony 
pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;  

issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or 

take such other actions as appropriate. 

See 29  C.F.R. § 1614.404(c).    OFO  will  aggressively  utilize  sanctions  if  parties 
fail,  without  good  cause  shown,  to  comply  with  the  appellate  procedures  or  to

effectuate  the  policies  of  the  Commission  by  both  deterring  the  non-complying 
party from similar conduct in the future and by providing an equitable remedy to 
the opposing party.  

Before OFO issues sanctions on either party to an appeal, it will provide the party 
with a notice to show cause why the sanctions identified in the notice should not 
be imposed.  The notice to show cause will identify the specific conduct that is the 

10  See  for  example,  Smith  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation  (Federal  Aviation  Administration),  EEOC 
DOC 0320080085, (Mar. 21, 2012) (finding that because the agency failed to comply with OFO’s explicit 
order  to  produce  comparative  evidence,  the  agency  was  subject  to  sanctions  for  its  noncompliance, 
including  the  drawing  of  an  adverse  inference  that  the  requested  comparative  evidence  would  have 
reflected unfavorably on the agency). 

11  The  Commission  has  exercised  its  inherent  authority  to  enforce  its  Part  1614  regulations  by 
ordering  sanctions  in  response  to  various  violations.    See  for  example,  Vu  v.  Social  Security 
Administration,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120072632  (Jan.  20,  2011)(finding  that  the  agency  was  subject  to 
sanctions for its failure to submit the complete complaint file); DaCosta v. Dep’t. of Education,  EEOC 
Appeal No. 01995992 (Feb. 25, 2000)(Commission issued sanction against agency for failure to complete 
timely investigation).

basis for the finding of noncompliance and will describe the proposed sanction(s) 
to be imposed.  The notice to show cause will further provide the non-complying 
party with an opportunity to cure its noncompliance within a reasonable period of 
time, to be noted in the order.  If the party fails to cure its noncompliance or to 
otherwise  show  good  cause  why  sanctions  should  not  be  imposed,  OFO  shall 
impose the sanctions identified in its notice.12

D. 

Appeals Decisions Are Final 

An  appellate  decision  issued  under  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.405(a)  is  final  pursuant  to 
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.407  unless  a  timely  request  for  reconsideration  is  filed  by  a 
party to the case.  A party may request reconsideration within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of a decision of the Commission, which the Commission in its discretion 
may  grant,  if  the  party  demonstrates  that  1)  the  appellate  decision  involved  a 
clearly  erroneous  interpretation  of  material  fact  or  law,  or  2)  the  decision  will 
have a  substantial impact on the policies, practices,  or  operations  of the agency.  
See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.405(c); Section VII of this Chapter. 

12 Sanctions usually will be contained in the decision of the Commission on appeal.  If the sanction 
is  contained  in  a  separate  order  and  not  the  decision  on  the  appeal,  the  sanction  is  not  immediately 
reviewable.  Once OFO issues a decision on an appeal, the sanctioned party may request reconsideration 
pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.405(c).    If  the  sanction  is  issued  while  a  matter  is  pending  review  under 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.405(c) or is contained in a 29 C.F.R. § 1614.405(c) decision, there is no administrative 
review available.

VI. 

STANDARDS OF REVIEW ON APPEAL 

Generally,  standards  of  review  delineate  the  nature  of  the  inquiry  on  appeal  by 
establishing the extent to which the reviewing body will substitute its own judgment for 
that of  the prior  decision-maker.  The Commission has essentially  employed a de novo 
standard of review in issuing appeals decisions since it took over the federal sector EEO 
function  from  the  Civil  Service  Commission  pursuant  to  Reorganization  Plan  No.  1  of 
1978.   

The decision on an appeal from an agency’s dismissal or final action shall be based on a 
de  novo  review,  except  that  the  review  of  the  factual  findings  in  a  decision  by  an 
Administrative  Judge  issued  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109(i)  and  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.204(i) shall be based on a substantial evidence standard of review.  This Section 
of  the  Management  Directive  will  ensure  a  degree  of  uniformity  and  predictability  in 
assessing case development and in processing appeals. 

A. 

Review of Final Decisions Issued by the Agency 

Appeals  of  final  decisions  or  actions  issued  by  agencies,  duly  filed  pursuant  to 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.401(a), (d), or (e) will be considered by the Commission in the 
following manner:

on 
§ 1614.110(b) shall be reviewed de novo. 

individual  complaints  pursuant 

the  merits  of 

The  de  novo  standard  requires  that  the  Commission  examine  the  record 
without  regard  to  the  factual  and  legal  determinations  of  the  previous 
decision  maker.    On  appeal  the  Commission  will  review  the  documents, 
statements,  and  testimony  of  record,  including  any  timely  and  relevant 
submissions  of  the  parties,  and  the  Commission  will  issue  its  decision 
based  on  the  Commission’s  own  assessment  of  the  record  and  its 
interpretation of the law. 

As  a  general  rule,  no  new  evidence  will  be  considered  on  appeal  unless 
there  is  an  affirmative  showing  that  the  evidence  was  not  reasonably 
available prior to or during the investigation or during the hearing process.  
The  Commission  may  request  supplementation  of  the  record.    See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.404(b). 

Following  de  novo  review,  the  Commission  will  issue  decisions  on  the 
appeals of decisions issued pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.110(b) based on 
a preponderance of the evidence.

Where appropriate, and after the requisite analysis, the  Commission may 
adopt  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  final  decision  issued  by  the 
agency.    Such  an  adoption  does  not  short-cut  the  review  process,  but 
merely serves to expedite communication of the result of the review. 

B. 

Review of Decisions Issued by Administrative Judges 

The  Commission  shall  consider  an  appeal  by  either  an  agency  or  a  complainant 
following a final action based on a decision from an Administrative Judge issued 
pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109(g)  (summary  judgment  decisions),  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.109(i) (decisions on individual complaints), and 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.204(d) 
and  (i)  (decisions  on  class  complaints),  duly  filed  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.401 et seq., in the following manner: 

1. 

2. 

The  review  of  the  post-hearing  factual  findings  in  an  Administrative 
Judge’s  decision  shall  be  based  on  a  substantial  evidence  standard  of 
review.    In  Universal  Camera  Corp.  v.  National  Labor  Relations  Board, 
340  U.S.  474,  477  (1951),  the  Supreme  Court  noted  that  substantial 
evidence “is more than a mere scintilla.  It means such relevant evidence 
as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. . . .  
It ‘must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be 
established.    [I]t  must  be  enough  to  justify,  if  the  trial  were  to  a  jury,  a 
refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it 
is one of fact for the jury.’”  [Citations omitted.] 

Applying  the  substantial  evidence  review  standard,  the  Commission  will 
give deference to an Administrative Judge’s post-hearing factual findings 
based  on  evidence  in  the  record.    Factual  determinations  will  be 
distinguished  from  legal  determinations,  and  the  Administrative  Judge’s 
factual determinations will be given deference.  For example, a credibility 
determination of an Administrative Judge based on the demeanor or tone 
of voice of a witness will be accepted unless documents or other objective 
evidence  so  contradicts  the  testimony  of  the  witness  or  the  testimony  of 
the  witness  otherwise  so  lacks  in  credibility  that  a  reasonable  fact  finder 
would not credit it.  

3.  

A  finding  of  discriminatory  intent  will  be  treated  as  a  factual  finding 
subject to the substantial evidence review standard.  See Pullman-Standard 
Co. v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 293 (1982).

Legal determinations will be reviewed de novo on appeal. 

a. 

b. 

in  decisions,  whether  made  by  an 
Legal  determinations 
Administrative Judge or by the agency, will be reviewed using a de 
novo  standard.    There  will  be  no  presumption  that  the  previous 
decision-maker was correct in his/her interpretation or application 
of the law. 

An  Administrative  Judge’s  decision  to  issue  a  decision  without  a 
hearing  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.109(g)  will  be  reviewed  de 
novo.  The substantial evidence standard of review will apply only 
to  decisions  rendered  following  a  hearing  and  will  not  apply  to 
decisions  issued  on  summary  judgment  or  to  decisions  issued 
without a hearing with the consent of the parties. 

5. 

As  a  general  rule,  no  new  evidence  will  be  considered  on  appeal  unless 
there  is  an  affirmative  showing  that  the  evidence  was  not  reasonably 
available  prior  to  or  during  the  hearing.    The  Commission  may  request 
supplementation of the record.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.404(b). 

C. 

The Responsibility of the Parties 

1. 

On  appeal,  the  burden  is  squarely  on  the  party  challenging  the 
Administrative  Judge’s  decision  to  demonstrate  that  the  Administrative 
Judge’s factual determinations are not supported  by substantial evidence.  
This burden does not exist in a de novo review.  The appeals statements of 
the  parties,  both  supporting  and  opposing  the  Administrative  Judge’s 
decision,  are  vital  in  focusing  the  inquiry  on  appeal  so  that  it  can  be 
determined whether the Administrative Judge’s factual determinations are 
supported by substantial evidence. 

2. 

In  an  appropriate  case,  and  in  instances  where  a  party  fails  to  submit  a 
statement or brief in support of his/her appeal, the Commission may issue 
a summary decision.   

VII.  RECONSIDERATION 

A. 

Reconsideration Is Not an Appeal 

A request for reconsideration is not a second appeal to the Commission.  A party 
may request reconsideration within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Commission 
decision.    The  Commission,  in  its  discretion,  may  grant  the  request  if  the  party 
demonstrates that:

The  appellate  decision  involved  a  clearly  erroneous  interpretation  of 
material fact or law; or 

The  decision  will  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  policies,  practices,  or 
operations of the agency.  29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.405(c)(1) & (2). 

The Commission reserves the right to reopen any decision on its own motion.  See 
Parnell  v. Dep’t. of Veterans’ Affairs, EEOC Request No. 0520100031 (Dec. 7, 
2009).

Reconsideration Procedures 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Requests  for  reconsideration  and  any  supporting  statement  or  brief  must 
be  filed  with  the  Office  of  Federal  Operations  (OFO)  within  thirty  (30) 
days of receipt of a decision of the Commission and a statement or brief in 
opposition  to  a  request  for  reconsideration  must  be  filed  within  twenty 
(20) days of receipt of another party’s timely request for reconsideration.  
OFO  will  accept  statements  or  briefs  in  support  of  the  request  from 
complainants by fax transmittal, provided they are no more than ten (10) 
pages  long.    Agency  briefs  must  be  submitted  in  an  approved  digital 
format.    The  request  must  also  include  proof  of  service  on  the  opposing 
party.   

The requesting party must submit any supporting documents or brief at the 
time the request is filed.  The burden is on the requesting party to make a 
substantial showing that its request meets one of the two prerequisites for 
a granting of reconsideration.  

The  opposing  party  shall  have  20  days  from  receipt  of  another  party’s 
timely  request  for  reconsideration  in  which  to  submit  any  brief  or 
statement  in  opposition.    Such  brief  or  statement  must  be  served  on  the 
requesting  party  and  proof  of  service  must  be  included  with  the 
submission to OFO.  OFO will accept briefs or statements in opposition to 
the  request  from  complainants  by  fax  transmittal,  provided  they  are  no 
more than 10 pages long.  Agency briefs must be submitted in an approved 
digital format.   

4. 

Failure  to  provide  a  proof  of  service  or  to  submit  comments  within  the 
prescribed time frame will result in the denial of the request, or the option 
not to consider the party’s untimely statement or brief.

C. 

Reconsideration Decision Is Final 

The Commission’s decision on a request for reconsideration is final, and there is 
no further right by either party to request reconsideration.  If the decision remands 
the  complaint  for  further  agency  consideration,  the  parties  retain  the  rights  of 
appeal and reconsideration with respect to any subsequent decision. 

VIII.  REMEDIES 

A. 

An Agency Shall Provide Full Relief after a Finding of Discrimination 

When  the  agency  or  the  Commission  finds  that  the  agency  has  discriminated 
against an applicant or employee, the agency shall provide an appropriate remedy 
as explained in 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, subpart E. 

Clear and Convincing Standard Needed to Limit Relief; Duty to Cure 

B. 
Discrimination Remains 

1. 

2. 

When  an  Administrative  Judge,  agency,  or  the  Commission  finds  that 
discrimination  existed,  but  also  finds  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence 
that  the  agency  would  have  made  the  same  employment  decision  even 
absent  the  discrimination,  the  agency  shall  nevertheless  take  all  steps 
necessary to eliminate the  discriminatory  practice and  ensure that it does 
not recur. 

Back pay, computed in the manner prescribed by 5 C.F.R. § 550.805, shall 
be  awarded  from  the  date  the  individual  would  have  entered  on  duty, 
assumed the duties of the position at issue, or not been removed from the 
position unless clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant 
or  employee  would  not  have  been  selected  for,  placed  into,  or  removed 
from  the  position  even  absent  discrimination.    The  complainant  has  the 
obligation to mitigate damages.

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Compliance  with  Orders  of 
the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity 
Commission  in  final  federal  appeals  decisions  is  mandatory.    Section 
717(b)  of  Title  VII,  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-16(b)  provides  that  the 
Commission  shall  have  authority 
to  enforce  prohibitions  against 
discrimination  in  the  federal  government  “through  appropriate  remedies, 
including reinstatement  or hiring of  employees  with or without back pay 
as  will  effectuate  the  policies  of  this  section  and  shall  issue  rules, 
regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate 
to carry out its responsibilities.” 

The  ordered  relief  shall  be  provided  in  full  not  later  than  one  hundred 
twenty  (120)  days  after  receipt  of  the  final  decision  unless  otherwise 
ordered in the decision.  A decision is considered final when it is issued.  
The 120-day period includes the 30-day period in which the complainant 
can  file  a  request  for  reconsideration,  as  well  as  the  90-day  period  in 
which the complainant can file a civil action. 

A  complainant  may  petition  OFO  to  seek  enforcement  of  a  Commission 
Order.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.503(a).  The petition shall be submitted to OFO 
and shall set forth the basis for the complainant=s assertion that the agency 
  If  a  petition  is  docketed 
is  not  complying  with  the  decision. 
acknowledgment  letters  will  be  sent  to  both  parties  identifying  the  new 
docket  number  and  advising  them  of  the  right  to  submit  a  brief  or  to 
comment on the issue(s) in dispute.   

Where  the  Director  of  OFO  is  unable  to  obtain  satisfactory  compliance 
with the final decision, the Director shall submit appropriate findings and 
recommendations  for  enforcement  to  the  Commission  pursuant  to 
29 C.F.R.  §  1614.503(d).    Among  other  things,  the  Commission  may 
certify  the  matter  to  the  Office  of  Special  Counsel  pursuant  to  a 
memorandum  of  understanding.    See  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.503(f)  or  issue  a 
notice to show cause for noncompliance to the head of an agency that has 
failed  to  comply  with  a  Commission  order  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.503(e).

Where  the  Commission  has  determined  that  an  agency  is  not  complying 
with  a  prior  decision  and  wishes  to  complete  administrative  efforts,  the 
Commission shall notify  the complainant of his/her right to seek judicial 
review of the agency=s refusal to order the relief or commence a de novo 
proceeding.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.503(g). 

B. 

Interim Relief 

1. 

Interim  relief  where  the  agency  files  a  request  for  reconsideration  of  a 
decision  regarding  removal,  separation,  or  suspension  continuing  beyond 
the date of the request for reconsideration: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

When  the  agency  requests  reconsideration  and  the  case  involves 
removal,  separation,  or  suspension  continuing  beyond  the  date  of 
the  request  for  reconsideration,  and  when  the  decision  orders 
retroactive  restoration,  the  agency  shall  comply  with  the  decision 
to  the  extent  of  the  temporary  or  conditional  restoration  of  the 
employee  to  duty  status  in  the  position  specified  by  the 
Commission,  pending  the  outcome  of  the  agency=s  request  for 
reconsideration.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.502(b).  

The agency must notify the complainant that his/her restoration is 
temporary or conditional at the same time it seeks reconsideration.  
Failure  of  the  agency  to  provide  notification  will  result  in  the 
dismissal of the agency=s request.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.502(b)(3).   

When the agency seeks reconsideration of a decision that included 
an  award  of  payments  of  amounts  owed,  the  agency  may  delay 
such payment provided it advises the complainant of its delay and 
further  informs  the  complainant  that  it  will  pay  interest  on  any 
award  ultimately  determined  to  be  owed  to  the  complainant.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.502(b)(2).   

2. 

Interim  relief  where  an  agency  appeals  from  a  decision  of  an 
Administrative  Judge  in  a  case  involving  separation,  or  suspension 
continuing  beyond  the  date  of  the  appeal,  and  when  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision orders retroactive restoration: 

a. 

The  agency  shall  comply  with  the  decision  to  the  extent  of  the 
temporary or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status 
in  the  position  specified  in  the  decision,  pending  the  outcome  of 
the agency appeal.  The employee may decline the offer of interim 
relief.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.505(a)(1).

d. 

An agency may decline to return a complainant to his/her place of 
employment  if  it  determines  that  the  return  or  presence  of  the 
complainant  will  be  unduly  disruptive  to  the  work  environment.   
However,  the  agency  must  provide  prospective  pay  and  benefits.   
29 C.F.R. § 1614.505(a)(5). 

An  agency  also  may  delay  the  payment  of  other  amounts, 
exclusive  of  pay  and  benefits,  when  it  files  an  appeal  of  an 
Administrative  Judge=s  decision.    If  an  agency  declines  to  make 
such payments, it will be required to pay interest on these amounts 
from the date of the decision until payment is made if the outcome 
of the appeal requires the agency to make the payment.  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.505(a)(3).  

An  agency  must  inform  the  Commission  and  the  complainant  in 
writing  that  it  will  delay  making  required  payments  at  the  same 
time that it files its appeal that it will delay making the payments 
of  any  amounts  owed  pending  resolution  of  the  appeal.    See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.505(a)(4).  If an agency fails to inform either the 
complainant  or  the  Commission  and  fails  further  to  make  the 
the 
payments 
Commission will dismiss the appeal.  The complainant must file a 
request for dismissal with the Commission within twenty-five (25) 
days of the date of service of the agency=s appeal and provide the 
agency  with  a  copy  of  the  request.    The  agency  will  have  fifteen 
(15)  days  from  receipt  of  the  complainant=s  request  to  file  a 
response.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.505(b).

There  is  no  legitimate  basis  for  delay  in  complying  with  a  Commission 
order, particularly in those cases where the Commission has ordered relief 
after a finding of discrimination. 

OFO  will  aggressively  utilize  sanctions  if  the  agency  fails  to  implement 
the relief ordered.   

OFO  may  recommend  that  the  Commission  take  enforcement  action 
where  an  agency  does  not  comply  with  a  Commission  order,  or,  as 
directed  by  the  Commission,  refer  the  matter  to  another  appropriate 
agency.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.503(d).  The Commission may issue a show 
cause notice to the head of the federal agency that is in noncompliance or 
refer the matter  to  the  Office  of Special Counsel for enforcement action.  
See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.503(e) and (f).

5. 

OFO may issue a notice to the complainant that the administrative process 
for  securing  compliance  has  been  exhausted. 
  See  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.503(g).  Such a notice will inform the complainant of the right to 
file a civil action for enforcement of the Commission decision and to seek 
judicial review of the agency’s refusal to implement the relief ordered by 
the Commission, or of the right to commence proceedings pursuant to the 
appropriate statute.  

An OFO notice to the complainant advising that the administrative process 
for  securing  compliance  has  been  exhausted  may  be  issued  after  the 
Commission determines an agency is not complying with a prior decision, 
when an agency fails or refuses to submit a report of compliance required 
by the Commission, or upon receipt of a request from the complainant.  In 
determining  whether  to  issue  such  a  notice,  OFO  will  consider  such 
factors as whether the agency is making reasonable efforts to comply with 
the  Commission  order  or,  if  the  notice  is  requested  by  the  complainant, 
whether the complainant has legal representation to secure enforcement in 
court.    After  issuing  such  a  notice,  the  Commission  ordinarily  will 
terminate its administrative processing of the complaint.  Processing will 
continue,  however,  if  the  Director  of  OFO  determines  that  continued 
processing  would  effectuate  the  purposes  of  the  laws  enforced  by  the 
Commission. 

D. 

Priority Consideration for Cases Remanded for Investigation 

Agencies  should  give  priority  to  cases  remanded  for  an  investigation  if  this  is 
necessary to comply with the time frames contained in a Commission order.  OFO 
will  issue  sanctions  against  agencies  when  it  determines  that  agencies  are  not 
making  reasonable  efforts  to  comply  with  a  Commission  order  to  investigate  a 
complaint. 

E. 

Remand of Dismissed Claims 

Where a complainant’s appeal includes a dismissed claim that the Administrative 
Judge has affirmed but that OFO reverses either on appeal or on reconsideration, 
OFO  shall  remand  the  dismissed  claim  to  the  Administrative  Judge  for  further 
processing  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109.    Where  a  complainant 
appeals from  an agency  final  decision that includes a dismissed claim that OFO 
reverses,  OFO  shall  remand  the  dismissed  claim  to  the  agency  and  include  an 
order  directing  the  agency  to  process  the  matter  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.108, except that OFO may order the completion of the investigation within 
a time period shorter than 180 days.

CIVIL ACTIONS 

Filing  a  civil  action  terminates  Commission  processing  of  an  appeal.    See  29 C.F.R.

XI.  NOTICE REQUIREMENTS 

Agencies are required to notify complainants of their rights to appeal to the Commission 
and  to  file  a  civil  action  within  the  specified  limitations  periods.    Agencies  must  also 
notify  complainants  of  their  statutory  right  to  request  court  appointment  of  counsel  for 
representation in connection with the filing of civil actions, which arise from  Title VII, 
GINA,  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act.    See  Hilliard  v.  Volcker,  659  F.2d  1125  (D.C.  Cir. 
1981).    Therefore,  agencies  subject  to  29 C.F.R.  Part  1614  are  required  to  include  the 
appropriate  language  in  every  decision  on  complaints  which  allege  discrimination.   
Sample language is provided in Chapter 10, Section IV of this Management Directive.

CHAPTER 10  
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS, CIVIL ACTIONS, 
AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL 

I. 

INTRODUCTION  

Aggrieved persons must be made aware of administrative and civil action time limitations 
which potentially may bar an aggrieved person’s ability to file appeals and civil actions.  
All time periods set out in this Management Directive are stated in calendar days unless 
otherwise indicated.  The first day counted is the day after the event from which the time 
period begins to run and the last day of the period shall be included unless it falls on a 
Saturday  or  Sunday  or  federal  holiday,  in  which  case  the  period  shall  be  extended  to 
include  the  next  business  day.    All  time  periods  are  subject  to  waiver,  estoppel  and 
equitable tolling. 

All  parties  should  be  aware  that  attorney’s  fees  may  be  awarded  at  the  administrative 
level and beyond under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-

Under  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.401(b),  an  agency  is  required  to  file  an 
appeal to the Commission if the agency’s final order does not fully 
implement  the  decision  of  the  Administrative  Judge. 
  The 
Commission’s use of the word “may” in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.401(b) 
is  not  inconsistent  with  this  requirement.    The  agency  has  the 
option  to  appeal  if  it  is  not  satisfied  with  the  Administrative 
Judge’s decision.  If the agency chooses not to appeal, however, it 
must  fully  implement  the  Administrative  Judge’s  decision.    In 
other  words,  when  the  agency  decides  whether  it  will  fully 
implement the Administrative Judges’ decision, it is also deciding 
whether  to  appeal;  a  decision  to  fully  implement  means  that  it  is 
not appealing while a decision not to fully implement means that it 
is appealing.

Regardless  of  whether 
individual  complainant  pursued  any 
administrative complaint processing, a complainant may file a civil action 
in a court of competent jurisdiction within two years or, if the violation is 
willful, within three years of the date of the alleged violation of the Equal 
Pay Act.  Recovery of back wages is limited to two years prior to the date 
of  filing  suit,  or  to  three  years  if  the  violation  is  willful;  liquidated 
damages in an amount equal to lost back wages may also be awarded.  The 
filing of an administrative complaint does not toll the time for filing a civil 
action.

Filing  a  timely  civil  action  under  any  of  these  statutes  terminates  Commission 
processing of an appeal.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.409.  If a civil action is filed after 
an appeal has also been filed, the parties are requested to notify the Commission 
of this event in writing.

August, 2015 

The Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not extend the time limit for filing a civil action 
in  mixed  case  complaints.    See  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.310,  which  sets  forth  the 
statutory rights to file a civil action in mixed case complaints.  

IV.  NOTICE OF COMPLAINANT’S RIGHT TO REQUEST COURT 

APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND STATEMENT OF RIGHT TO 
APPEAL 

Consistent  with  the  court’s  holding  in  Hilliard  v.  Volcker,  659  F.2d  1125  (D.C.  Cir. 
1981),  it  is  the  Commission’s  policy  to  require  all  federal  agencies  subject  to  the 
Management  Directive  to  inform  complainants,  in  writing,  of  their  statutory  right  to 
request court  appointment of  counsel  for representation  in  connection  with  the  filing of 
civil  actions  that  arise under  Title  VII, the  Genetic  Information Nondiscrimination Act, 
and the Rehabilitation Act. 

In  Hilliard,  the  court  held  that  agencies  must  inform  complainants  unsuccessful  in  the 
administrative process that, in the event they file a civil action, the court has discretionary 
authority to appoint counsel for them.  A litigant who fails to request counsel should not 
be penalized because an agency has been remiss in its duty to inform the complainant of 
the court’s authority. 

Therefore, all federal agencies subject to 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 must include the following 
language in every final action or final decision on complaints which allege discrimination 
of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  disability,  genetic  information,  and/or 
retaliation:  

Within  30  days  of  your  receipt  of  the  final  action  or  final  decision  (as 
appropriate), you have the right to appeal this final action or final decision 
to:  

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
Office of Federal Operations  
P.O. Box 77960 
Washington, DC 20013 

You also have the right to file a civil action in an appropriate U.S. District 
Court.  If you choose to file a civil action, you may do so

decision (as appropriate) if no appeal has been filed,

within  90  days  after  receipt  of  the  EEOC’s  final 
decision on appeal, or  

after 180 days from the date of filing an appeal with 
the Commission if there has been no final decision 
by the Commission. 

You must name the person who is the official agency head or department 
head  as  the  defendant.    Agency  or  department  means  the  national 
organization, and not just the local office, facility, or department in which 
you  might  work.    Do  not  name  just  the  agency  or  department.    In  your 
case, you must name                   as the defendant.  [The Administrative 
Judge or agency must supply the name of the proper person.]  You must 
also state the official title of the agency head or department head.  Failure 
to provide the name or official title of the agency head or department head 
may result in dismissal of your case.  

If  you  decide  to  file  a  civil  action,  under  Title  VII  or  under  the 
Rehabilitation Act, and if you do not have or cannot afford the services of 
an  attorney,  you  may  request  that  the  Court  appoint  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  and  that  the  Court  permit  you  to  file  the  action  without 
payment  of  fees,  costs,  or  other  security.    The  grant  or  denial  of  the 
request is within the sole discretion of the Court.  Filing  a request for 
an attorney does not extend your time in which to file a civil action.  Both 
the request and the civil action MUST BE FILED WITHIN NINETY (90) 
CALENDAR  DAYS  of  the  date  you  receive  the  final  action  or  final 
decision (as appropriate) from the agency or the Commission.

REMEDIES 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

In  federal  EEO  law,  there  is  a  strong  presumption  that  a  complainant  who  prevails  in 
whole or in part on a claim of discrimination is entitled to full relief which places him/her 
in the position s/he would have been in absent the agency’s discriminatory conduct.  See 
Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418-419 (1975). 

This  Chapter  of  the  Management  Directive  sets  forth  guidance  for  use  by  agencies  and 
persons  seeking  remedial  relief  in  a  variety  of  areas,  including:  back  pay,  front  pay, 
attorney’s fees and costs, awards of compensatory damages, and other forms of equitable 
relief.  This guidance applies only to the federal sector administrative process. 

II. 

NON-DISCRIMINATORY PLACEMENT 

When  an  agency  or  the  Commission  finds  that  an  employee  of  the  agency  was 
discriminated  against,  the  agency  shall  provide  the  individual  with  non-discriminatory 
placement  into  the  position  s/he  would  have  occupied  absent  the  discrimination.    For 
cases  in  which  the  employee  is  not  selected  for  a  position  or  promotion  due  to 
discrimination,  this  would  include  an  offer  of  placement  into  the  position  sought,  or  a 
substantially  equivalent  position.    See  Carson  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120100078 (Feb. 16, 2012). 

The  offer  should  be  made  retroactive  to  the  date  of  the  selection  in  question.    The 
individual should receive all step or pay increases and monetary benefits associated with 
the  position.    See  Stewart  v.  Dep’t.  of  Homeland  Security,  EEOC  Request  No. 
0520070124 (Nov. 14, 2011).  A “substantially equivalent position” is a position within 
the  same  commuting  area.    Bakken  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120093529 (Aug. 8, 2011). 

When the relief ordered includes the offer of a position or a promotion, the offer shall be 
made  to  the  complainant  in  writing,  providing  the  complainant  fifteen  (15)  days  from 
receipt of the offer to notify the agency of the acceptance or rejection.  Failure to respond 
within the 15-day time limit shall be construed as a declination.  Any back pay liability 
shall cease to accrue with either the actual placement of the complainant into the position 
in question, or with the date the offer was declined. 

In cases involving a discriminatory termination, the agency should offer to reinstate the 
complainant to his/her former position retroactive to the date of the termination.  See Oni 
v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Treasury,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720100015  (Oct.  11,  2011).    The 
complainant should also receive all applicable benefits and step or pay increases. 

Management Directive 
11-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  some  cases,  there  is  evidence  that  discrimination  was  one  of  multiple  motivating 
factors  for  an  employment  action.    In  these “mixed  motive” cases,  the  agency does not 
have  to  offer  complainant  the  position  sought  if  it  can  demonstrate  by  clear  and 
convincing  evidence  that  it  would  have  taken  the  same  action  even  absent  the 
discrimination.    See  Montante  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120110240  (Nov.  9,  2011),  request  for  reconsideration  denied,  EEOC  Request  No. 
0520120259  (June  8,  2012).    If  the  agency  is  able  to  make  this  demonstration,  the 
complainant is not entitled to personal relief such as reinstatement, hiring, or promotion.  
The  complainant  may  still  be  entitled  to  declaratory  relief,  injunctive  relief,  and/or 
attorneys’ fees and costs.  Id. 

When an individual accepts an offer of employment as a remedy for discrimination, s/he 
shall  be  deemed  to  have  performed  service  for  the  agency  during  the  period  he  would 
have  served  but  for  the  discrimination  for  all  purposes  except  for  meeting  service 
requirements for completion of a required probationary or trial period. 

III.  BACK PAY 

A. 

Back Pay Issues 

When  an  agency  or  the  Commission  finds  that  an  employee  of  the  agency  was 
discriminated  against,  the  agency  shall  provide  the  individual  with  non-
discriminatory  placement  into  the  position  s/he  would  have  occupied  absent  the 
discrimination,  with  back  pay  computed  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  5  C.F.R. 
§ 550.805.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(c)(1).  The purpose of a back pay award is 
to restore to the complainant the income he would have otherwise earned but for 
the  discrimination.    See  Albemarle  Paper  Co.  v.  Moody,  422  U.S.  at  418-419 
(1975);  Davis  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Petition  No.  04900010  (Nov.  29, 
1990).  A number of discriminatory personnel actions can generate back pay.  The 
most common actions generating back pay are: removals, suspensions, denials of 
promotions, and failure to hire.  

Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation.  The back pay 
computation should also include any applicable step increases or pay differentials.  
See  Morrow  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720070058  (Nov.  13, 
2009) (ordering the agency to provide complainant with a back pay award which 
included interest,  overtime, and night  pay  differential).    Under  Title  VII,  GINA, 
and the Rehabilitation Act, back pay is limited to two years prior to the date the 
discrimination complaint was filed. 

Management Directive 
11-2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 

Determining Gross Back Pay 

Back pay includes all forms of compensation and reflects fluctuations in working 
time,  overtime  rates,  penalty  overtime,  Sunday  premium  and  night  work, 
changing rates of pay, transfers, promotions, and privileges of employment.  The 
Commission also construes “benefits” broadly to include annual leave, sick leave, 
health insurance, and retirement contributions.  Vereb v. Dep’t. of Justice, EEOC 
Petition  No.  04980008  (Feb.  26,  1999);  Holly  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC 
Petition No. 04A50003 (Nov. 2, 2005).  

[T]he Commission recognizes that precise measurement cannot always be used to 
remedy  the  wrong  inflicted,  and  therefore,  the  computation  of  back  pay  awards 
inherently  involves  some  speculation.    Hanns  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC 
Petition  No.  04960030  (September  18,  1997).    The  Commission  has  held  that 
uncertainties involved in a back pay determination should be resolved against the 
agency that has already been found to have committed acts of discrimination.  Id.  
See  also  Davis  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Petition  No.  04900010  (Nov.  29, 
1990); and Besemer v.  U.S.  Postal Service, EEOC Petition No.  04890005 (Dec. 
14, 1989). 

C. 

Overtime or Premium Pay as a Component of Back Pay 

Back pay will be required to cover any overtime or premium pay that would have 
been  worked  absent  discrimination.    The  parties  often  disagree  over  whether 
overtime would have been worked and to what extent overtime could have been 
earned.    The  overtime  component  of  a  back  pay  award  should  generally  be 
calculated  based  upon  the  average  amount  of  overtime  worked  by  similarly 
situated employees.  Haines v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Petition No. 04A50018 
(Nov.  23,  2005);  Holly  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Petition  No.  04A50003 
(Nov. 2, 2005).  If the position is unique, such that a comparison with a similarly 
situated employee is not possible, the agency should calculate overtime based on 
the actual overtime worked by the person who was selected for the position.  See, 
for  example,  Bowman  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120112333 
(Oct.  3,  2011),  request  for  reconsideration  denied,  EEOC  Request  No. 
0520120091 (Mar. 16, 2012). 

D. 

Retirement Deductions and Back Pay 

The  Commission  has  held  that  make  whole  relief  requires  the  agency  to  make 
retroactive tax-deferred contributions to the complainant’s retirement account for 
the  relevant  period.    To  the  extent  complainant  would  have  received  agency 
contributions to a retirement fund as a component of her salary, she is entitled to 
have  her  retirement  benefits  adjusted  as  part  of  her  back  pay  award,  including 
sums  which  the  account  would  have  earned  during  the  relevant  period.    The 

Management Directive 
11-3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agency  should  provide  its  calculations  of  the  amount  of  contributions  to  the 
agency’s retirement system that both it and complainant would have made during 
her absence, as well as the earnings which would have accrued.  See Kretschmar 
v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Petition No. 04A40044 (Mar. 25, 2005).   

E. 

Interim Earnings Deducted from Back Pay 

If the complainant lost a job or did not receive a position due to discrimination, 
the complainant has the responsibility of mitigating the harm by looking for other 
work.    Ghannam  v.  Agency  for  International  Development,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01990574 (June 22, 2004).  Wages earned by the employee while separated from 
the agency are commonly called “interim wages.”  The agency should deduct the 
interim wages earned by the complainant from  the amount of  back pay  owed to 
the  complainant  as  provided  for  in  Title  VII.    42  U.S.C.  §  2000e  (5)(g).    If  the 
agency believes that the complainant did not do enough to mitigate lost wages, it 
must  prove  so  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.    See  McNeil  v.  U.S.  Postal 
Service, EEOC Request No. 05960436 (Dec. 9, 1999). 

However, income that the complainant could have earned while still holding the 
position  at  the  agency  should  not  be  subtracted  or  offset  from  back  pay.   
“Moonlight”  employment is  employment that  the employee  could have  engaged 
in  even  while  federally  employed.    See  5  C.F.R.  §  550.805(e)(1).    See  Paulk  v. 
U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Petition  No.  04A10026  (Oct.  4,  2001)  (Commission 
found  that  petitioner’s  overtime  earnings  were  earned  from  his  working  65-80 
hours  per  week  in  a  position  he  acquired  during  the  period  subsequent  to  his 
termination  from  the  agency,  and  thus  petitioner  could  not  have  held  both  the 
supplemental job and the job he lost because of discrimination, and therefore, the 
agency properly offset these earnings from complainant’s back pay award).  

F.  Worker’s Compensation Benefits May Be Partially Deductible from Back Pay 

A Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) award is meant to compensate 
for lost wages and/or reparation for physical injury.  A claim of back pay against a 
Federal  agency  during  the  same  time  period  covered  by  a  FECA  claim  would 
have  the  potential  for  a  double  recovery  of  back  pay.    Any  portion  of  a  FECA 
award  attributable  to  lost  wages  during  the  back  pay  period  in  a  discrimination 
finding  will  be  deducted  from  the  back  pay  award.    The  portion  of  the  FECA 
award that is paid as reparation for physical injuries is not related to wages earned 
and should not be deducted.   

If  the  agency  contends  that  receipt  of  workers’  compensation  would  result  in 
double recovery, the agency must determine what portion of the FECA benefits, if 
any,  applied  to  back  pay,  leave  and  other  benefits,  and  what  portion  of 

Management Directive 
11-4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complainant’s  FECA  benefits  applied  to  reparation  for  physical  injuries.    See 
Ulloa v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Petition No. 04A30025 (Aug. 3, 2004).  

G. 

Availability for Work – Prerequisite for Receipt of Back Pay 

The applicable regulations provide that the amount of back pay awarded shall be 
reduced  by  the  amounts  earnable  with  reasonable  diligence  by  the  person 
discriminated  against.    Thus,  the  complainant  has  a  duty  to  mitigate  or  lessen 
damages by making a reasonable good faith effort to find other employment.  This 
means that the complainant must seek a substantially equivalent position, that is, a 
position  that  affords  virtually  identical  compensation,  job  responsibilities, 
working conditions, status, and promotional opportunities as the position he was 
discriminatorily  denied.    See  Knott  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0720100049 (July 5, 2010). 

As a general rule, a complainant must be ready, willing, and able to work during 
the period of back pay recovery in order to receive back pay.  The Commission 
has stated that if an agency can present persuasive evidence that complainant was 
not  able  to  work  during  the  back  pay  period,  back  pay  would  not  be  awarded; 
however,  the  agency  has  the  burden  of  proof.    Morman  v.  Dep’t.  of  Defense 
(Defense  Commissary  Agency),  EEOC  Petition  No.  04A10006  (July  31,  2002).  
The  back  pay  regulation  5  C.F.R.  §  550.805(c)  provides  that  periods  of 
unavailability may not be included in the back pay period unless such periods of 
time are the result of an illness or injury related to an unjustified or unwarranted 
personnel action.  When a complainant receives workers’ compensation due to an 
agency’s  failure  to  provide  reasonable  accommodation,  this  does  not  preclude  a 
back pay award.  The receipt of workers’ compensation benefits does not indicate 
that a person was unable to work during the back pay period.  See McClendon v. 
U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Petition No. 04960013 (May 22, 1997).   

Unemployment Compensation Not Deducted from Back Pay – the Collateral Source 

H. 
Rule 

Unemployment compensation is an interim source of income, but it is a collateral 
source  in the  sense  that it comes  from the state  – not the  federal  employer.   An 
employer cannot set  off  or  mitigate its damages  through  a collateral source –  in 
this  case  the  state’s  payment  of  unemployment  compensation  even  though  the 
employer might have contributed to the source.  

When a back payment is made where unemployment had been received, in theory 
the unemployment compensation represents an overpayment from the state and is 
due to the state.  See Morra-Morrison v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Petition No. 
04980023  (June  2,  1999).    This  process  of  recoupment  is  generally  a  matter 
between the complainant and the state.

Tax Consequences of a Lump Sum Payment of Back Pay 

The  Commission  has  recognized  that  an  agency  is  liable  for  any  increased  tax 
liability  resulting  from  receipt  of  a  lump  sum  of  back  pay  in  a  single  tax  year.   
When an individual receives back pay as a lump sum payment, s/he is entitled to a 
tax  offset  payment  for  the  tax  year  in  which  she  received  the  payment.   
Additionally,  the  individual  will  have  the  burden  of  establishing  the  amount  of 
his/her  increased  federal  income  tax  liability  to  the  agency.    See  Mohar  v.  U.S. 
Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0720100019 (Aug. 29, 2011); Teresita Lorenzo 
v.  Dep’t.  of  Defense  Education  Activity,  EEOC  Petition  No.  01A61644 
(September  29,  2005);  Warren  Goetze  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  EEO  Appeal  No. 
01991530 (Aug. 23, 2001).   

J. 

Liquidated Damages (ADEA and EPA only) 

Liquidated  damages  in  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  cases  are  generally  monetary 
awards equal to, and in addition to, the back pay due to the complainant when a 
violation is found to be willful or in reckless disregard of the statutes.  

In  Equal  Pay  Act  cases,  willfulness  is  not  a  required  factor  for  liquidated 
damages.    Such  damages  are  available  for  a  violation  of  the  EPA  unless  the 
agency  can  prove  that  it  acted  in  “good  faith”  and  reasonably  believed  that  its 
actions  did  not  violate  the  EPA.    A  finding  of  willfulness  under  the  EPA, 
however,  may  extend  the  limitations  period  on  back  pay  from  two  (2)  years  to 
three (3) years.   

Since  an  EPA  claim  may  also  be  brought  as  a  sex-based  wage  discrimination 
claim under Title VII, compensatory damages may also be available if the claim is 
brought under both statutes. 

While liquidated damages for willful violations of the ADEA are available in the 
private  sector  under  29  U.S.C.  Sec.  626(b),  they  are  not  available  under  the 
federal sector provisions at Sec. 633a (b).  See Jacobson v. Shalala, EEO Request 
No.  05930689,  (June  2,  1994);  Falks  v.  Rubin,  EEOC  Request  No.  05960250, 
(September 6, 1996); Amaro v. Potter, EEOC Appeal No. 0120020929, (May 29, 
2003). 

K. 

Restoration of Leave 

Where  there  has  been  a  finding  of  discrimination,  the  complainant  is  entitled  to 
back  pay  for  time  lost  from  work  during  the  applicable  periods,  as  well  as  the 
restoration of any leave used because of the agency’s discriminatory actions.  Cox 
v.  Social  Security  Administration,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720050055  (Dec.  24, 
2009).    For  example,  the  restoration  of  leave  taken  for  purposes  of  avoiding  or 

Management Directive 
11-6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recovering from a discriminatory hostile work environment is a valid component 
of  equitable  relief.    See  Burton  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0720090046  (June  9,  2011);  see  also  Lamb  v.  Social  Security  Administration, 
EEOC Appeal No. 0120103232 (Mar. 21, 2012) (leave restoration ordered where 
denial  of  reasonable  accommodation  resulted  in  leave  usage);  Complainant  v. 
Dep’t.  of  Defense,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120084008  (June  6,  2014)  (leave 
restoration ordered where leave used in lieu of improperly denied official time). 

IV.  FRONT PAY 

Front  pay  is  an  equitable  remedy  that  compensates  an  individual  when  reinstatement  is 
not  possible  in  certain  limited  circumstances.    The  Commission  has  held  that  front  pay 
may  be  awarded  in  lieu  of  reinstatement  when:  (1)  no  position  is  available;  (2)  a 
subsequent  working  relationship  between  the  parties  would  be  antagonistic;  or  (3)  the 
employer has a record of long-term resistance to anti-discrimination efforts.  Brinkley v. 
U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Request No, 05980429 (Aug. 12, 1999).  The fact that front 
pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement implies that the complainant is able to work but 
cannot  do  so  because  of  circumstances  external  to  the  complainant.    See  Cook  v.  U.S. 
Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01950027 (July 17, 1998). 

The  Commission  has  held  that  front  pay  is  an  equitable  remedy  to  be  awarded  for  a 
reasonable  future  period  required  for  the  victim  of  discrimination  to  reestablish  his 
rightful place in the job market.  See Deidra Brown-Fleming v. Dep’t. of Justice, EEOC 
Petition No. 0420080016 (Oct. 28, 2010).  

V. 

OTHER FORMS OF EQUITABLE RELIEF 

As appropriate, the agency shall also: 

1. 

2. 

Cancel  an  unwarranted  personnel  action  and  restore  the  employee  to  the  status 
s/he occupied prior to the discrimination; 

Expunge  any  adverse  materials  relating  to  the  discriminatory  employment 
practice from the agency’s records;1

 and 

1  See  Sipriano  v.  Dep’t.  of  Homeland  Security,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0120103167  (Jan.  20,  2011),

reconsideration denied, EEOC Request No. 0520110295 (May 12, 2011) (ordering the agency to expunge 
evaluation reports and documents referencing a discriminatory investigation).

Provide  the  individual  with  a  full  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  employee 
benefit that was denied - for example, training, preferential work assignments, or 
overtime scheduling.2

When  the  finding  of  discrimination  involves  a  performance  appraisal,  the  appropriate 
relief should include raising the rating to that which the individual would have received 
absent  the  discrimination.    McKenzie  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120100034  (July  7,  2011);  Hairston  v.  Dep’t.  of  Education,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120071308  (Apr.  15,  2010).    In  addition,  the  individual  is  entitled  to  all  benefits  and 
awards  that  s/he  would  have  received  if  she  had  achieved  the  higher  performance 
appraisal  rating.    Cook  v.  Dep’t.  of  Labor,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720080045  (Feb.  22, 
2010). 

  See 

It  is  also  appropriate  to  order  training  for  agency  personnel  found  to  have  engaged  in 
discrimination,  and  to  consider  taking  disciplinary  action  against  those  officials  who 
engaged in the discrimination.3
, EEOC Appeal No. 
0120073831  (September  22,  2009),  request  for  reconsideration  denied,  EEOC  Request 
No. 0520100086 (Mar. 22, 2010) (ordering the agency to provide the Selecting Official 
who discriminated against complainant 16 hours of EEO training and to consider taking 
disciplinary action against the official).  The Commission does not consider training to be 
“discipline.”  See Morrow v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070058 (Nov. 
13, 2009). 

James v. Dep’t. of Agriculture

For  example,  in  Burton  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720090046  (June  9, 
2011),  one  of  the  responsible  management  officials  found  to  have  engaged  in  unlawful 
discrimination  and  retaliation  was  a  high-level  management  official  who  set  the 
leadership tone for the entire facility, and, thus, requiring five hours of EEO training for 
all facility management and supervisory staff was appropriate.  See also Kitson v. Dep’t. 
of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  0720100052  (Feb.  15,  2011),  request  for  reconsideration 
denied, EEOC Request No. 0520110312 (June 10, 2011) (ordering the agency to provide 
training  for  upper-level  employees  at  an  agency  facility  following  a  finding  of 
discriminatory  non-selection);  Wagner  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0120103125  (Dec.  1,  2010)  (ordering  the  agency  to  provide  EEO  training  to  all 
employees at an agency facility following a finding that agency managers and employees 
subjected complainant to a hostile work environment).   

The  Commission  has  also  found  that,  in  cases  involving  discriminatory  policies  or 
practices, the appropriate relief includes ordering the agency to “cease and desist” from 
adhering to that policy or practice.  For example, in Smith v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC 

2 See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(c). 

3 In fact, the Commission strongly urges that agencies include consideration of disciplinary action 
in all agency orders on findings of intentional discrimination.  In certain circumstances, training may be 
ordered for additional agency managers and staff.

Request  No.  0520100287  (July  9,  2010),  the  Commission  ordered  the  agency  to  cease 
and  desist  from  requiring  that  all  contact  with  EEO  Counselors  be  arranged  by 
management officials. 

Following  a  finding  of  discrimination,  the  agency  should  take  steps  to  ensure  that  the 
same type of action does not recur.  In Cheeks v. Dep’t. of the Army, EEOC Appeal No. 
0120091345 (Feb. 1, 2012), the agency was found to have engaged in racial harassment.  
The  agency  was  ordered  to  take  all  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  complainant  had  no 
contact  with  the  supervisor  responsible  for  the  harassment,  as  well  as  to  provide 
complainant  with  a  designated  management  official  to  whom  he  could  report  any 
subsequent  acts  of  harassment.    See  also  Ighile  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
0720110010  (Apr.  13,  2012)  (ordering  the  agency  to  cease  and  desist  from  all  hostile 
conduct  directed  to  complainant,  and  take  appropriate  action  to  ensure  that  his  co-
workers cease and desist from any hostile conduct). 

VI.  ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS 

A. 

Introduction 

Attorney’s  fees  and  costs  shall  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.501(e). 

In federal EEO law, there is a strong presumption that a complainant who prevails 
in  whole  or  in  part  on  a  claim  of  discrimination  is  entitled  to  an  award  of 
attorney’s fees and costs.  More specifically, complainants who prevail on claims 
alleging discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as 
amended,  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  as  amended,  are  presumptively 
entitled  to  an  award  of  attorney’s  fees  and  costs,  unless  special  circumstances 
render  such  an  award  unjust.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.501(e)(1).    (Complainants 
prevailing on claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  of 1967, 
as  amended,  and  the  Equal  Pay  Act  of  1963,  as  amended,  are  not  entitled  to 
attorney’s  fees  at  the  administrative  level.)    Only  where  a  Title  VII,  GINA,  or 
Rehabilitation Act complainant rejects an offer of resolution made in accordance 
with 29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(c) and does not obtain more relief than the agency had 
offered, or in the rarest of other circumstances, might an agency limit or deny an 
award of fees. 

B. 

Determination of Prevailing Party Status 

1. 

A  “prevailing  party,”  within  the  meaning  of  Section  706(k)  of  Title  VII, 
42 U.S.C.  §  2000e-5(k),  is  a  complainant  who  has  succeeded  on  any 
significant issue that achieved some of the benefit the complainant sought 
in filing the complaint.  Texas State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland I.S.D., 489 

Management Directive 
11-9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
U.S. 782 (1989).  The Commission has relied on a two-part test set forth in 
Miller v. Staats, 706 F.2d 336 (D.C. Cir. 1983), for determining whether a 
complainant is a prevailing party.  Baldwin v. Dep’t. of Health & Human 
Services,  EEOC  Request  No.  05910016  (Apr.  12,  1991).    To  satisfy  the 
first part of the test, the complainant must have substantially received the 
relief  sought.   Id.  To  satisfy the  second part  of the test, there must be a 
determination that the  complaint was  a catalyst  motivating the agency to 
provide the relief.  Id. (citing Miller, 706 F.2d at 341).  A purely technical 
or  de  minimis  success  is  insufficient  to  confer  “prevailing  party”  status.   
Texas State Teachers Ass’n. at 792. 

The touchstone is whether the actual relief on the merits materially alters 
the  legal  relationship  between  the  parties  by  modifying  the  agency’s 
behavior in a way that directly benefits the complainant.  Farrar v. Hobby, 
506  U.S.  103  (1992);  Bragg  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01945699 (Mar. 7, 1996).  Even an award of nominal monetary damages 
may  be  sufficient  to  meet  this  standard.    Farrar.    Monetary  relief  is  not 
required;  non-monetary  relief  such  as  reinstatement  or  a  higher 
performance rating is sufficient.  Id. 

An  attorney  who  represents  himself  is  not  entitled  to  an  award  of  fees.   
Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432 (1991).  Neither a non-attorney nor a federal 
employee (including attorneys) who represents a complainant is entitled to 
an award of fees.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(1)(iii).

A prevailing complainant is presumptively entitled to fees and costs unless 
special  circumstances  render  such  an  award  unjust.

(1983); Thomas v. Dep’t. of State, EEOC Appeal No. 01932717 (June 10, 
1994).    Special  circumstances  should  be  construed  narrowly.    The 
following arguments are not sufficient to show special circumstances:  

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

the complainant did not need an attorney;  

the  complainant’s  attorney  worked

the complainant’s attorney accepted the case pro bono;

the  complainant’s  attorney  was  paid  from  some  private  fee 
agreement;

implement 

the  decision,  and 

the  Commission  upholds 

Agencies are not required to pay for attorney’s fees for services rendered 
during the pre-complaint process unless an Administrative Judge issues a 
decision  finding  discrimination,  the  agency  issues  a  final  order  that  does 
not 
the 
Administrative Judge’s decision  on appeal.    If the agency  agrees  to fully 
implement the Administrative Judge’s decision, it cannot be compelled to 
pay  attorney’s  fees  for  fees  incurred  during  the  pre-complaint  process, 
except  that  fees  may  be  recovered  for  a  reasonable  period  of  time  for 
services  performed  in  reaching  the  decision  whether  to  represent  the 
complainant.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.501(e)(1)(iv).    The  agency  and  the 
complainant can agree, however, that the agency  will pay attorney’s fees 
for pre-complaint process representation.  Id. 

No  attorney’s  fees  may  be  awarded  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment  Act,  see  Coome  v.  Social  Security  Administration,  EEOC 
Appeal No. 0720120010 (Oct. 12, 2012), or Equal Pay Act, see Jacobsen 
v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal Nos. 0720100046 and 0720100047

Awards to Prevailing Parties in Negotiated Settlements 

1. 

2. 

A complainant who prevails through a negotiated settlement is entitled to 
attorney’s fees and costs under the same standards as any other prevailing

F.2d 880 (D.C. Cir. 1980); EEOC v. Madison Community Unit Sch. Dist. 
12,  818  F.2d  577  (7th  Cir.  1987);  Cerny  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  EEOC 
Request No. 05930899 (Oct. 19, 1994).  A settlement agreement that fails, 
however, to preserve the issue of fees and costs will operate as an implicit 
waiver of fees and costs.  Wakefield v. Matthews, 852 F.2d 482 (9th Cir. 
1988); Elmore v. Shuler, 787 F.2d 601 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  The Commission 
strongly  encourages  parties  to  resolve  fee  and  cost  issues  by  negotiated 
settlement.4

The Administrative Judge will not review a negotiated fee agreement for 
fairness or reasonableness, except in class cases.  Foster v. Boise-Cascade, 
Inc., 577 F.2d 335 (5th Cir.)(per curiam), reh’g denied, 581 F.2d 267 (5th 
Cir.  1978);  Jones  v.  Amalgamated  Warbasse  Houses,  Inc.,  721 F.2d  881 
(2d  Cir.  1983),  cert.  denied,  466  U.S.  944  (1984).    In  class  cases,  the 
Administrative  Judge  should  review  the  agreement  to  ensure  that  the 
negotiated fee is fair and reasonable to all parties.  

E. 

Awards of Costs and Fees for Expert and Non-Lawyer Services 

1. 

A  prevailing  complainant  is  entitled  to  recovery  of  his/her  costs.    Costs 
include  those  costs  authorized  by  28  U.S.C.  §  1920.    29  C.F.R. 
§ 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(C).  These include: witness fees; transcript costs; and 
printing  and  copying  costs.    In  addition,  reasonable  out-of-pocket 
expenses may include all costs incurred by the attorney that are normally 
charged  to  a  fee-paying  client  in  the  normal  course  of  providing 
representation.  Hafiz v. Dep’t. of Defense, EEOC Petition No. 04960021 
(July 11, 1997).  These costs may include such items as mileage, postage, 
telephone calls, and photocopying. 

2. 

A  prevailing complainant is  entitled to expert fees as part of recoverable 
attorney’s  fees.    42  U.S.C.  §  1988.    The  fee  is  not  limited  to  per  diem 
expenditures,  but  includes  all  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  the 

4  Where  the  parties  enter  into  a  settlement  agreement  that  provides  for  but  does  not  quantify  the 
amount of attorney’s fees and costs, the attorney should submit his/her statement of fees and costs and 
supporting documentation to the agency for determination of the amount due.  The agency should issue a 
decision on fees within 60 days of receipt of the statement and supporting documentation.  See 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A).   If the complainant disputes the amount awarded, s/he may file an appeal with 
the Commission.

retention  of  an  expert.    Id.    Recovery  is  generally  limited  to  testifying 
experts,  but  fees  may  be  awarded  for  non-testifying  experts  if  the 
complainant  can  show  that  the  expert’s  services  were  reasonably 
necessary to the case. 

A prevailing complainant is entitled to compensation for the work of law 
clerks, paralegals, and law students  under the supervision  of members of 
the bar, at market rates, 29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(1)(iii), but not for clerical 
services.  Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274 (1989).   

Reasonable  costs  incurred  directly  by  a  prevailing  complainant  (for 
example, one who is unrepresented or who is represented by a non-lawyer) 
are compensable.  Hafiz, supra.  Costs must be proved in the same manner 
as fees are, and the complainant must provide documentation, such as bills 
or receipts.  

Witness  fees  shall  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  28  U.S.C.  § 1821, 
except that no award shall be made for a federal employee who is in a duty 
status when made available as a witness.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(2)(iii).

Computation of Attorney’s Fees 

1. 

Attorney’s  fees  will  be  computed  by  determining  the  “lodestar.”    The 
“lodestar”  is  the  number  of  hours  reasonably  expended  multiplied  by  a 
reasonable hourly rate.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983).  
By  regulation,  the  Commission  uses  the  same  basis  for  calculating  the 
amount of attorney’s fees.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B). 

a. 

b. 

c. 

All  hours  reasonably  spent  in  processing  the  complaint  are 
compensable.    Fees  shall  be  paid  for  services  performed  by  an 
attorney  after  the  filing  of  a  written  complaint,  provided  that  the 
attorney  provides  reasonable  notice  of  representation  to  the 
agency, Administrative Judge, or Commission, except that fees are 
allowable for a reasonable  period of  time prior to the notification 
of  representation  for  any  services  performed  in  reaching  a

be awarded only under the circumstances set forth above in Section 
III.B.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(1)(iv).   

An attorney is eligible for work performed at the appeals stage for 
an award of fees, provided the complainant prevails at this stage.

f. 

The  number  of  hours  should  not  include  excessive,  redundant,  or 
otherwise  unnecessary  hours.    Hensley,  461  U.S.  at  434;  Bernard 
v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans  Affairs,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01966861  (July 
17,  1998).    The  presence  of  multiple  counsel  at  hearing  or 
deposition  may  be  considered  duplicative  in  certain  situations, 
such as where one or more counsel had little or no participation or 
where the presence of multiple counsel served to delay or prolong 
the  hearing  or  deposition.    Hodge  v.  Dep’t.  of  Transportation, 
EEOC  Request  No.  05920057  (Apr.  23,  1992).    The  presence  of 
multiple  counsel  is  not  necessarily  duplicative,  however,  and  is 
often  justifiable.    Time  spent  on  clearly  meritless  arguments  or 
motions,  and  time  spent  on  unnecessarily  uncooperative  or 
contentious  conduct  may  be  deducted.    Luciano  v.  Olsten  Corp., 
109  F.3d  111  (2d  Cir.  1997);  Clanton  v.  Allied  Chemical  Corp., 
416 F. Supp. 39 (E.D. Va. 1976). 

A reasonable hourly rate is a rate based on “prevailing market rates 
in  the  relevant  community”  for  attorneys  of  similar  experience  in 
similar  cases.    Cooley  v.  Dep’t.  of  Veterans  Affairs,  EEOC 
Request No. 05960748 (July 30, 1998) (quoting Blum v. Stenson, 
465 U.S. 886 (1984)).  A higher rate for time spent at hearing may 
be  reasonable  if  trial  work  would  command  a  higher  rate  under 
prevailing  community  standards.    Where  multiple  attorneys  have 
worked  on  the  case,  the  rate  for  each  attorney  should  be 
determined separately.  The limits on hourly rates contained in the 
Equal Access to Justice Act are not applicable. 

The applicable rate for fee awards to public interest attorneys is the 
prevailing  hourly  rate  for  the  community  in  general.    Hodge  v. 
Dep’t. of  Transportation, EEOC  Request No. 05920057 (Apr. 23, 
1992).    In  Save  Our  Cumberland  Mountains,  Inc.  v.  Hodel, 
857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court held that the prevailing 
market rate should also be used to determine fee awards to private, 
for-profit  attorneys  who  represent  certain  clients  at  reduced  rates, 
which reflect "non-economic" goals.  See also Cooley v. Dep’t. of 
Veterans  Administration,  EEOC  Request  No.  05960748  (July  30, 
1998);  Hatfield  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  EEOC  Appeal  No. 
01892909 (Dec. 12, 1989). 

g. 

The  hours  spent  on  unsuccessful  claims  should  be  excluded  in 
considering  the  amount  of  a  reasonable  fee  only  where  the 
unsuccessful claims are distinct in all respects from the successful 
claims.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983).  

Management Directive 
11-14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
h. 

The  degree  of  success  is  an  important  factor  in  calculating  an 
award  of  attorney’s  fees.    Farrar  v.  Hobby,  506  U.S.  103  (1992).   
In determining the degree of success, the relief obtained (including 
both monetary and equitable relief) should be considered in light of 
the complainant’s goals.  City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561 
(1986); Cullins v. Georgia Department of Transportation, 29 F.3d 
1489  (1994).    Where  the  complainant  achieved  only  limited 
success,  the  complainant  should  receive  only  the  amount  of  fees 
that  is  reasonable  in  relation  to  the  results  obtained.    Hensley  v. 
Eckerhart,  461  U.S.  424  (1983);  Cerny  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy, 
EEOC  Request  No.  05930899  (Oct.  19,  1994).    However,  a 
reasonable  fee  may  not  be  determined  by  mathematical  formula 
based  on  monetary  relief  obtained.    Riverside  at  563;  Cullins  at 
1493.  The determination of the degree of success should be made 
on  a  case-by-case  basis.    In  many  cases,  an  award  of  equitable 
relief  only  or  a  small  award  of  monetary  damages  may  reflect  a 
high  degree  of  success.    Failure  to  obtain  the  maximum  damages 
allowable  or  a  large  monetary  award  generally  does  not  reflect 
limited success. 

2. 

There  is  a  strong  presumption  that  the  lodestar  represents  the  reasonable 
fee.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(B).    In  limited  circumstances,  the 
lodestar figure may be adjusted upward or downward, taking into account 
the degree of success, the quality of representation, and long delay caused 
by the agency.  The lodestar may be adjusted only under the circumstances 
described in this subpart. 

a. 

b. 

An  award  of  attorney’s  fees  may  be  enhanced  in  cases  of 
exceptional  success.    The  complainant  must  show  that  such  an 
enhancement  is  necessary  to  determine  a  reasonable  fee.    City  of 
Burlington  v.  Dague,  505 U.S.  557  (1992).    Conversely,  a  fee 
award  may  be  reduced  in  cases  of  limited  success.    Texas  State 
Teachers Ass=n v. Garland I.S.D., 489 U.S. 782 (1989).  However, 
there  is  no  requirement  that  fee  awards  be  proportional  to  the 
amount  of  monetary  damages  awarded.    City  of  Riverside  v. 
Rivera, 477 U.S. 561 (1986). 

An award of attorney’s fees may be enhanced where the quality of 
representation  is  exceptional.    McKenzie  v.  Kennickell,  875  F.2d 
330  (D.C.  Cir.  1989).    Conversely,  the  award  of  attorney’s  fees 
may be reduced where the quality of representation was poor, the 
attorney’s  conduct  resulted  in  undue  delay  or  obstruction  of  the 
process, or where settlement likely could have been reached much 
earlier  but  for  the  attorney’s  conduct.    Lanasa  v.  City  of  New

Orleans,  619  F.  Supp.  39  (E.D.  La.  1985);  Barrett  v.  Kalinowski, 
458 F. Supp. 689 (M.D. Pa. 1978). 

The  lodestar  may  not  be  enhanced  to  compensate  for  the  risk  of 
non-payment, risk of losing the case, or difficulty finding counsel.  
City of Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557 (1992). 

A lodestar may be adjusted to compensate for a long delay where 
the  delay  is  caused  by  the  agency.    Pennsylvania  v.  Delaware 
Valley Citizens’ Council, 483 U.S. 711 (1987). 

If  the  Administrative  Judge  or  agency  determines  that  an 
adjustment to the lodestar is appropriate, the Administrative Judge 
or  agency  may  calculate  the  adjustment  by  either  adding  or 
subtracting  a  lump  sum  from  the  lodestar  figure  or  by  adding  or 
subtracting a percentage of the lodestar.  The Administrative Judge 
or  agency  has  discretion  to  determine  the  amount  of  the 
adjustment.    Normally,  the  adjustment  should  be  no  more  or  less 
than  75%  of  the  lodestar  figure.    The  Administrative  Judge  or 
agency  must  provide  a  detailed  written  explanation  of  why  the 
adjustment was made, and what factors supported the adjustment.  
Coutin v. Young & Rubicam Puerto Rico, Inc., 124 F.3d 331 (1st 
Cir. 1997). 

3. 

f. 

The party seeking to adjust the lodestar, either up or down, has the 
burden of justifying the deviation.  Copeland v. Marshall, 641 F.2d 
880, 892 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Brown v. Dep’t. of Commerce, EEOC 
Appeal No. 01944999 (May 17, 1996).

Where a complainant rejects an offer of resolution and the final decision is 
not more favorable than the offer, attorney’s fees and costs incurred after 
the  expiration  of 
thirty  (30)-day  acceptance  period  are  not 
compensable.    29  C.F.R.  § 1614.109(c)(3).    This  regulation  further 
provides that an Administrative Judge may award attorney’s fees and costs 
despite  the  complainant’s  failure  to  accept  an  offer  of  resolution  where 
Athe  interests  of  justice  would  not  be  served@  by  a  denial  of  fees.    An 
example  of  when  fees  would  be  appropriate  is  where  the  complainant 
received an offer of resolution, but was informed by a responsible agency 
official that the agency would not comply in good faith with the offer (for 
example, would unreasonably delay implementation of the relief offered).  
A  complainant  who  rejected  the  offer  for  that  reason,  and  who  obtained 
less  relief  than  was  contained  in  the  offer  of  resolution,  would  not  be 
denied attorney’s fees in this situation.

the  decision-making  authority, 

When 
the  agency,  an 
Administrative  Judge,  or  the  Commission,  issues  a  decision  finding 
discrimination, the decision normally should provide, under the standards 
set  forth  above,  for  the  complainant’s  entitlement  to  attorney’s  fees  and 
costs.  The  complainant’s  attorney then must submit a verified statement 
of  attorney’s  fees  (including  expert  witness  fees)  and  other  costs,  as 
appropriate, to the agency or Administrative Judge within thirty (30) days 
of receipt of the decision and must submit a copy of the statement to the 
agency.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(2)(i).5

A  statement  of  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  must  be  accompanied  by  an 
affidavit  executed  by  the  attorney  of  record  itemizing  the  attorney’s 
charges  for  legal  services.    A  verified  statement  of  fees  and  costs  shall 
include the following:

c. 

a  list  of  services  rendered  itemized  by  date,  number  of  hours, 
detailed summary of the task, rate, and attorney’s name;  

documentary  evidence  of  reasonableness  of  hours,  such  as 
contemporaneous  time  records,  billing  records,  or  a  reasonably 
accurate substantial reconstruction of time records;  

documentary  evidence  of  reasonableness  of  rate,  such  as  an 
affidavit  stating  that  the  requested  rate  is  the  attorney’s  normal 
billing  rate,  a  detailed  affidavit  of  another  attorney  in  the 
community familiar with prevailing community rates for attorneys 
of  comparable  experience  and  expertise,  a  resume,  a  list  of  cases 
handled,  or  a  list  of  comparable  cases  where  a  similar  rate  was 
accepted; and 

documentation of costs. 

d. 
National Ass’n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, 675 F.2d 
1319 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  A fee award may be reduced for failure to provide 
adequate documentation.  If seeking an  adjustment to the lodestar figure, 
the fee application shall clearly identify the specific circumstances of the 
case that support the requested adjustment.  Id. 

5 Where the Commission finds discrimination in a case in which the agency takes final action under 
29 C.F.R.  § 1614.110(a),  the  Commission  will  remand  the  case  to  the  Administrative  Judge  for  a 
determination  of  attorney’s  fees.    Where  the  decision  on  appeal  originates  from  a  case  handled 
exclusively by the agency (that is, where the complainant elected a final agency decision under 29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.110(b)), the Commission will remand the case to the agency for a determination of attorney’s fees.

The agency may respond to the statement of fees and costs within 30 days 
of  its  receipt.    If  the  agency  contests  the  fee  request,  it  must  provide 
equally detailed documentation in support of its arguments.  Id.   

Discovery into the reasonableness of the hours or rate is permissible, but 
discouraged.    The  Administrative  Judge  has  discretion  to  grant  or  deny 
permission to conduct discovery by interrogatory or document request. 

The Administrative Judge or agency will issue a decision determining the 
amount  of  attorney’s  fees  or  costs  due  within  60  days  of  receipt  of  the 
statement and affidavit.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A).  The decision 
should  provide  a  written  explanation  of  any  award  of  fees  and  costs, 
including, as appropriate, findings of fact, analysis, and legal conclusions.  
29 C.F.R. § 1614.501(e)(2)(ii)(A).  The decision must include a notice of 
right to appeal to the Commission. 

The Commission encourages the parties to resolve fee and cost issues by 
negotiated  settlement  during  the  30-day  period  for  filing  a  fee  petition.   
The Administrative Judge will not review a negotiated fee agreement for 
fairness or reasonableness, except in class cases. 

If the Administrative Judge decides to bifurcate the liability and damages 
determinations  in  a  case,  the  decision  on  liability  should  provide  for 
entitlement  to  attorney’s  fees  and  the  subsequent  decision  on  damages 
should also include the determination of the amount of the award of fees 
and  costs.    The  complainant’s  attorney  should  be  directed  to  submit  the 
statement  of  fees  and  costs  within  30  days  of  receipt  of  the  decision 
finding liability.  The attorney may submit a supplemental petition for fees 
incurred during the damages phase of the case.  

H.  Miscellaneous Issues 

1. 

An Administrative Judge may award interim fees pendente lite6
 where the 
complainant  has  prevailed  on  an  important  non-procedural  allegation  of 
, 446 U.S. 
discrimination in the course of the case.  
754  (1980);  Trout  v.  Garrett,  891  F.2d  332  (D.C.  Cir.  1989).    However, 
interim awards should be granted only under special circumstances, such 
as  where  a  complainant’s  attorney  has  invested  substantial  time  and 
resources into a case over a long period of time. 

Hanrahan v. Hampton

6 Pendente lite is Latin for awaiting the litigation (lawsuit).  It is applied to court orders (such as 

temporary child support) which are in effect until the case is tried, or rights that cannot be enforced until 
the lawsuit is over.

3. 

A prevailing complainant is entitled to an award of fees for time spent on a 
fee claim including time spent defending the award on appeal.  Southeast 
Legal Defense Group v.  Adams, 657 F.2d 1118 (9th Cir. 1981); Lund v. 
Affleck, 587 F.2d 75 (1st Cir. 1978).  However, the Administrative Judge 
may  reduce  or  eliminate  fees  for  time  spent  on  litigating  the  fee  award 
where  fee  claims  are  exorbitant  or  the  time  devoted  to  preparing  a  fee 
claim is excessive.  Gagne v. Maher, 594 F.2d 336 (2d Cir. 1979), aff’d, 
448 U.S. 122 (1980).  A reasonableness standard applies.  Black v. Dep’t. 
of the Army, EEOC Request No. 05960390 (Dec. 9, 1998). 

Even  absent  a  finding  of  discrimination,  the  Administrative  Judge  has 
authority to impose attorney’s fees and costs as an appropriate sanction for 
refusal to obey discovery or other orders.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(f)(3)(v).  
For  example,  a  complainant  may  be  entitled  to  attorney’s  fees  when  the 
agency fails without  good cause shown to respond to discovery  requests, 
Shine  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01972201  (Dec.  12, 
1998),  or  falsifies  documents  or  testimony,  Wichy  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Air 
Force, EEOC Appeal No. 01962972 (September 25, 1998).  Fees and costs 
may  be  awarded  for  work  associated  with  efforts  to  secure  discovery 
compliance,  even  when  the  complainant  does  not  prevail  on  the  merits.   
Stull v. Dep’t. of Justice, EEOC Appeal No. 01942827 (June 15, 1995).

VII.  COMPENSATORY DAMAGES 

Compensatory damages  are awarded to compensate a complaining party for losses or suffering 
inflicted  due  to  the  discriminatory  act  or  conduct.    See  Carey  v.  Piphus  435  U.S.  247,  254 
(1978)(purpose of damages is to “compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of 
constitutional  rights”).    Compensatory  damages  “may  be  had  for  any  proximate  consequences 
which  can  be  established  with  requisite  certainty.”    22  Am  Jur  2d  Damages  §  45  (1965) 
Compensatory  damages  include  damages  for  past  pecuniary  loss  (out-of-pocket  loss),  future 
pecuniary  loss,  and  nonpecuniary  loss  (emotional  harm).    See  Goetze  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy, 
EEOC Appeal No. 01991530 (Aug. 23, 2001).

Entitlement to Seek Compensatory Damages 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Pursuant to Section 102(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a complainant 
who  establishes  his/her claim  of  unlawful  discrimination  may  receive,  in 
addition to equitable remedies, compensatory damages for past and future 
pecuniary losses (that is, out of pocket expenses) and non-pecuniary losses 
(for  example,  pain  and  suffering,  mental  anguish). 
  42  U.S.C. 
§ 1981a(b)(3).  For an employer with more than 500 employees, the limit 
of liability for future  pecuniary  and non-pecuniary  damages is $300,000.  
Id.    Complainants  prevailing  on  claims  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment Act of 1967, as amended, and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as 
amended, are not entitled to compensatory damages at the administrative 
level. 

Under  Section  102  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991,  compensatory 
damages  may  be  awarded  for  past  pecuniary  losses,  future  pecuniary 
losses, and non-pecuniary losses that are directly or proximately caused by 
the  agency’s  discriminatory  conduct.    However,  Section  102  prohibits 
such  awards  for  an  employment  practice  that  is  unlawful  because  of  its 
disparate  impact.    Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  under 
Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992).  

However,  Section  102  also  provides  that  an  agency  is  not  liable  for 
compensatory  damages  in  cases  of  disability  discrimination  where  the 
agency demonstrates that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the 
complainant’s disability. 

An agency can demonstrate a good faith effort by proving that it consulted 
with the individual with a disability and attempted to identify and make a 
reasonable  accommodation.    Schauer  v.  Social  Security  Administration, 
EEOC  Appeal  No.  01970854  (July  12,  2001);  compare  Luellen  v.  U.S. 
Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01951340  (Dec.  23,  1996)  (agency 
demonstrated  good  faith  effort  where  it  consulted  with  complainant  and 

Management Directive 
11-20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
her  physicians  in  attempting  to  identify  a  reasonable  accommodation, 
despite the fact that these efforts were not sufficient to afford complainant 
a reasonable accommodation); Morris v. Dep’t. of Defense, EEOC Appeal 
No. 01962984 (Oct. 1, 1998) (agency did not make a good faith effort to 
identify  and provide a reasonable accommodation for complainant  where 
it  did  not  make  any  attempt  to  find  an  available  office  position  for 
complainant in spite of his repeated requests.). 

4. 

The Commission may set out the amount of compensatory damages to be 
awarded  by  the  respondent  agency  in  its  decisions.    Alternatively,  the 
Commission may remand the matter to the agency for a determination of 
the amount of compensatory damages. 

B. 

Legal Principles 

1. 

Non-Pecuniary Damages 

Non-pecuniary  damages  are  losses  that  are  not  subject  to  precise  quantification 
including  emotional  pain  and  injury  to  character,  professional  standing,  and 
reputation.    Compensatory  damages  are  awarded  to  compensate  for  losses  or 
suffering  inflicted  due  to  discrimination.    Punitive  damages  are  not  available 
against the federal government. 

The  particulars  of  what  relief  may  be  awarded,  and  what  proof  is  necessary  to 
obtain  that  relief,  are  set  forth  in  detail  in  the  Commission  Notice  No.  915.002, 
Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  under  Section  102  of  the  Civil 
Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992).  Briefly stated, the complainant must submit 
evidence to show that the agency’s discriminatory conduct directly or proximately 
caused the losses for which damages are sought.  Id. at 11-12, 14; Rivera v. Dep’t. 
of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 01934157 (July 22, 1994).  

the  extent 

The  amount  awarded  should  reflect 
the  agency’s 
discriminatory action directly or proximately caused harm to the complainant and 
the extent to which other factors may have played a part.  The Commission Notice 
No. 915.002, Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under Section 102 
of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991  (July  14,  1992)  at  11-12.    The  amount  of  non-
pecuniary damages should also reflect the nature and severity of the harm to the 
complainant, and the duration or expected duration of the harm.  Id. at 14.  

to  which 

In  Carle  v.  Dep’t.  of  the  Navy,  the  Commission  explained  that  “objective 
evidence”  of  non-pecuniary  damages  could 
the 
complainant  explaining  how  s/he  was  affected  by  the  discrimination.    EEOC 
Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 1993).  Non-pecuniary damages must be limited to 

include  a  statement  by 

Management Directive 
11-21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the sums necessary to compensate the injured party for the actual harm and should 
take into account the severity of the harm and the length of the time the injured 
party  has  suffered  from  the  harm.    Carpenter  v.  Dep’t.  of  Agriculture,  EEOC 
Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995). 

Objective  evidence  of  compensatory  damages  can  include  statements  from 
complainant  concerning  his  emotional  pain  or  suffering,  inconvenience,  mental 
anguish,  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life,  injury  to  professional  standing,  injury  to 
character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other non-
pecuniary  losses  that  are  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  discriminatory  conduct.    Id.  
Statements from others including family members, friends, health care providers, 
or  other  EEO  Counselors  (including  clergy)  could  address  the  outward 
manifestations  or  physical  consequences  of  emotional  distress, 
including 
sleeplessness,  anxiety,  stress,  depression,  marital  strain,  humiliation,  emotional 
distress, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, significant weight loss or gain, or a 
nervous  breakdown.    Id.    Complainant’s  own  testimony,  along  with  the 
circumstances of a particular case, can suffice to sustain his burden in this regard.  
Id.    The  more  inherently  degrading  or  humiliating  the  defendant’s  action  is,  the 
more  reasonable  it  is  to  infer  that  a  person  would  suffer  humiliation  or  distress 
from that action.  Id.   

Evidence  from  a  health  care  provider  or  other  expert  is  not  a  mandatory 
prerequisite  for  recovery  of  compensatory  damages  for  emotional  harm.    See 
Lawrence  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  01952288  (Apr.  18,  1996) 
(citing Carle v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan.. 5, 1993)).  
The absence of supporting evidence, however, may affect the amount of damages 
appropriate in specific cases.  Id. 

Non-pecuniary  damages  must  be  limited  to  compensation  for  the  actual  harm 
suffered as a result of the agency’s discriminatory actions.  See Carter v. Duncan-
Huggans,  Ltd.,  727  F.2d  1225  (D.C.  Cir.  1994);  The  Commission  Notice  No. 
915.002,  Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  Under  Section  102  of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) at 13.  A proper award should take 
into account the severity of the harm and the length of time that the injured party 
suffered the harm.  See Carpenter, supra.  Additionally, the amount of the award 
should not be “monstrously excessive” standing alone, should not be the product 
of  passion  or  prejudice,  and  should  be  consistent  with  the  amount  awarded  in 
similar cases.  See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service, EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 
(Apr. 15, 1999), citing  Cygnar v. City of  Chicago, 865 F. 2d  827, 848 (7th Cir. 
1989).    Finally,  we  note  that  in  determining  non-pecuniary  compensatory 
damages,  the  Commission  has  also  taken  into  consideration  the  nature  of  the 
agency’s  discriminatory  actions.    See  Utt  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal 
No.  0720070001  (Mar.  26,  2009);  Brown-Fleming  v.  Dep’t.  of  Justice,  EEOC 
Appeal No. 0120082667 (Oct. 28, 2010).

2. 

Past Pecuniary Damages 

Compensatory damages may be awarded for pecuniary losses that are directly or 
proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct.  See The Commission 
Notice  No.  915.002,  Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  under 
Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) at 8.  Pecuniary losses 
are  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  agency's  unlawful  action, 
including job-hunting expenses, moving expenses, medical expenses, psychiatric 
expenses,  physical  therapy  expenses,  and  other  quantifiable  out-of-pocket 
expenses.  Id.  Past pecuniary losses are losses incurred prior to the resolution of a 
complaint through a finding of discrimination, or a voluntary settlement.  Id. at 8-
9.  

In a claim for pecuniary compensatory damages, complainant must demonstrate, 
through appropriate evidence and documentation, the harm suffered as a result of 
the agency's discriminatory action.  Rivera v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal 
No.  01934156  (July  22,  1994);  The  Commission  Notice  No.  915.002, 
Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  Under  Section  102  of  the  Civil 
Rights  Act  of  1991  (July  14,  1992),  at  11-12,  14;  Carpenter  v.  Dep’t.  of 
Agriculture, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995).  Objective evidence in 
support of a claim for pecuniary damages includes documentation showing actual 
out-of-pocket  expenses  with  an  explanation  of  the  expenditure.    See  The 
Commission Notice No. 915.002, Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available 
Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) at 11-12; Carle 
v. Dep’t. of the Navy, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369 (Jan. 5, 1993).  The agency is 
only  responsible  for  those  damages  that  are  clearly  shown  to  be  caused  by  the 
agency's discriminatory conduct.  Id.  To recover damages, the complainant must 
prove that the employer's discriminatory actions were the cause of the pecuniary 
loss.  The Commission Notice No. 915.002, Compensatory and Punitive Damages 
Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (July 14, 1992) at 8. 

3. 

Future Pecuniary Damages 

Future  pecuniary  losses  are  losses  that  are  likely  to  occur  after  resolution  of  a 
complaint.    See  Compensatory  and  Punitive  Damages  Available  under  Section 
102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Commission Notice No. 915.002 at 9 .   

An  award  for  the  loss  of  future  earning  potential  considers  the  effect  that 
complainant's  injury  will  have  on  her  ability  in  the  future  to  earn  a  salary 
comparable  with  what  she  earned  before  the  injury.    Brinkley  v.  U.S.  Postal 
Service,  EEOC  Request  No.  05980429  (Aug.  12,  1999)  citing  McKnight  v. 
General Motors Corp., 973 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1992).  Where complainant 
has  shown  that  her  future  earning  power  has  been  diminished  as  a  result  of  the 
agency's discrimination, the Commission has awarded  future pecuniary damages 
for  the  loss  of  future  earning  capacity.    See  Morrison  v.  U.S.  Postal  Service, 

Management Directive 
11-23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EEOC Appeal No. 07A50003 (Apr. 18, 2006) (citing Brinkley, supra); Hernandez 
v.  U.S.  Postal  Service,  EEOC  Appeal  No.  07A30005  (July  16,  2004).    Proof  of 
entitlement  to  loss  of  future  earning  capacity  involves  evidence  suggesting  that 
the  individual's  injuries  have  narrowed  the  range  of  economic  opportunities 
available to her.  Carpenter v. Dep’t. of Agriculture, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 
(July  17,  1995).    Generally,  the  party  seeking  compensation  for  loss  of  earning 
capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty 
or reasonable probability that the loss has been sustained.  Id., (citing Annotation, 
Evidence  of  Impaired  Earnings  Capacity,  18  A.L.R.  3d  88,  92  (1968)).    Such 
evidence  need  not  prove  that  the  injured  party  will,  in  the  near  future,  earn  less 
than  she  did  previously,  but  that  “[her]  injury  has  caused  a  diminution  in  [her] 
ability to earn a living.”  Carpenter, supra, (citing Gorniak v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger 
Corp., 889 F.2d 481, 484 (3d Cir. 1989)).

CHAPTER 12  
SETTLEMENT AUTHORITY 

I. 

INTRODUCTION  

Public  policy  favors  the  amicable  settlement  of  disputes.    It  is  clear  that  this  policy  in 
favor  of settlement  of disputes applies  particularly  to employment discrimination cases.  
See, for example, Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm., 581 
F.2d  941  (D.C.  Cir.  1978);  Shaw  v.  Library  of  Congress,  479  F.  Supp.  945  (D.D.C. 
1979).    Agencies  are  encouraged  to  seek  resolution  of  EEO  complaints  through 
settlement at any time during the administrative or judicial process.  Agencies and EEO 
complainants  should  be  creative  in  considering  settlement  terms.    In  this  Chapter,  we 
discuss  the  authority  for  settlements  of  EEO  disputes  and  various  options  for  those 
settlements. 

II. 

AUTHORITY  

Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  expressly  encourages  the  settlement  of 
employment  discrimination  disputes  without  litigation.    Courts  have  consistently 
encouraged  the  settlement  of  discrimination  claims  and  have  upheld  those  settlements 
when challenged.  See, for example, Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Comm., 432 U.S. 355 (1977); Alexander v.  Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 
36 (1974). 

The  Supreme  Court  held  in  Chandler  v.  Roudebush,  425  U.S.  840  (1976),  that  federal 
employees have the same rights under the employment discrimination statutes as private 
sector employees, thus recognizing the right of federal employees to enter into voluntary 
settlements  with  federal  agencies.    As  a  result,  Section  717  of  Title  VII  of  the  Civil 
Rights  Act  of  1964  authorizes  agencies  to  fashion  settlements  of  EEO  disputes  in 
resolution of such claims.  The same analysis applies to disputes brought under Section 
501  or  505  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  Section  15  of  the  Age  Discrimination  in 
Employment  Act  of  1967,  and  the  Equal  Pay  Act.    See  Matter  of  Albert  D.  Parker, 
64 Comp. Gen. 349 (1985). 

Conciliation  and  voluntary  settlement  are  critical  to  efforts  to  eradicate  employment 
discrimination, both in the public and private sectors.  The legislative history of Section 
717 of Title VII is unequivocal in stressing that the broadest latitude exists in determining 
the appropriate remedy for achieving this end.1

Public Welfare, 92nd Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 
1972, at 424 (Comm. Print 1972).

12-1 

 
 
 
  
                                                 
 
The  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission’s  strong  support  for  settlement 
attempts at all stages of the EEO complaint process is codified in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.603, 
which states, “Each agency shall make reasonable efforts to voluntarily settle complaints 
of discrimination as early as possible in, and throughout, the administrative processing of 
complaints,  including  the  pre-complaint  counseling  stage.”2    Settlement  agreements 
entered  into  voluntarily  and  knowingly  by  the  parties  are  binding  on  the  parties.   
Settlements may not involve waiver of remedies for future violations.  Settlements of age 
discrimination complaints must also comply with the requirements of the Older Workers 
Benefits Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. § 626, involving waivers of claims.  That is, a waiver 
in settlement of an age discrimination complaint must be knowing and voluntary.3

The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel has affirmed the broad authority of 
agencies to settle EEO disputes by applying remedies a court could order if the case were 
to go to trial.  In an opinion interpreting the authority of an agency to settle a Title VII 
class  complaint,  the  Department’s  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  advised  that  a  complainant 
can  obtain  in  settlement  whatever  the  agency  concludes,  in  light  of  the  facts  and 
recognizing the inherent uncertainty of litigation, that a court could order as relief in that 
case  if  it  were  to  go  to  trial.    In  the  case  it  reviewed,  which  alleged  discrimination  in 
classification  decisions,  the  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  determined  that  the  agency  could 
agree not to reclassify positions of specific employees downward because a court could 
enjoin  reclassification  of  the  positions  of  those  employees  if  the  court  found  some 
cognizable  danger  of  recurrent  violation.    The  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  found  the 
proposed  settlement  valid  under  Title  VII,  even  though  the  Office  of  Personnel 
Management  contended  that  the  agency’s  authority  to  reclassify  pursuant  to  applicable 
statutes, rules, and regulations cannot be superseded by settlement. 

The  relief  provided  by  an  agency  to  settle  an  EEO  dispute  cannot  be  greater  than  the 
relief  a  court  could  order  if  that  particular  dispute  were  to  go  to  trial.    For  example, 
assume  that  a  GS-9  employee  files  an  EEO  complaint  alleging  discrimination  in  the 
denial of a promotion to the level of a GS-11.  If the employee has met the time-in-grade 
and  any  other  job-related  requirements,  it  is  appropriate  to  offer  in  settlement  a 
retroactive  promotion  to  GS-11.    It  would  not  be  appropriate,  however,  to  propose  a 
promotion  to  a  GS-12  position  for  which  the  employee  has  not  met  the  requirements.   
However,  if  an  individual  was  denied  promotion  to  a  GS-11  position  and  one  or  more 

2  One  of  the  mechanisms  for  settling  complaints  is  the  offer  of  resolution,  which  is  set  forth  in 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.109(c).  Offers of resolution are not, however, the only way to settle complaints; they 
are a particular method, which, in certain circumstances, can limit an agency’s liability for attorney’s fees 
and costs.  

3  Section  (f)(2)  of  the  OWBPA  in  conjunction  with  Sections  (f)(1)(A)  through  (E)  set  forth  the 
minimum standards.  A settlement agreement is knowing and voluntary when the complainant is given a 
reasonable period of time to consider the settlement agreement, and the waiver is worded in a reasonably 
understandable  way,  specifically  refers  to  rights  or  claims  under  the  ADEA,  and  does  not  waive  future 
rights.  In addition, the settlement agreement must provide something of value in exchange for the waiver 
and must advise the complainant to consult with an attorney before signing the agreement.

individuals  who  got  the  promotion  at  that  time  were  subsequently  promoted  to  GS-12 
based  on  a  career  ladder,  then  it  may  be  appropriate  to  offer  a  GS-12  position  in 
settlement of the complaint.  

On  the  other  hand,  parties  are  encouraged  to  be  creative  in  resolving  an  employment 
dispute  and  may  agree  to  settle  a  complaint  for  relief  that  may  be  different  than  that 
which a court might order, as long as it is no greater than what a court might order.  For 
example, an agency may settle a complaint involving the termination of an employee by 
agreeing to pay for or provide outplacement services to help the former employee find a 
new  job,  provided  that  the  cost  of  the  outplacement  services  does  not  exceed  the  total 
monetary  relief  a  court  could  order  if  the  complainant  were  to  prevail  in  the  case.    In 
another  example,  an  agency  could  agree  to  reassign  a  complainant  to  a  different 
supervisor  or  office  in  a  settlement  of  a  complaint,  alleging  discriminatory  failure  to 
promote, where the complainant and the supervisor who made the promotion decision do 
not get along.  

III.  TITLE VII AUTHORITY INDEPENDENT OF BACK PAY ACT  

The Comptroller General of the United States has considered objections to settlements of 
EEO  disputes  in  a  number  of  cases.    In  these  decisions,  the  Comptroller  General  has 
confirmed  the  authority  of  agencies  to  enter  into  settlements  of  EEO  claims  and 
considered ancillary questions about settlements.  

In  one  of  these  decisions,  the  Comptroller  General  affirmed  that  Title  VII  contains 
authority for remedying employment discrimination and this authority is independent of 
the authority contained in the Back Pay Act to provide back pay only where a finding has 
been made of “an unwarranted and unjustified personnel action.”  5 U.S.C. § 5596.  “The 
connection between Title VII and the Back Pay Act arises only because the Commission 
has provided in its regulations on remedial actions that when discrimination is found, an 
award  of  back  pay  under  Title  VII  is  to  be  computed  in  the  same  manner  as  under  the 
Back  Pay  Act  regulations.”    Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission,  Informal 
Settlement of Discrimination Complaints, 62 Comp. Gen. 239, 242 (1983).  The authority 
to  award  back  pay  is  derived  from  Title  VII;  the  regulations  borrow  the  formula  for 
calculating the amount of back pay owed from the Back Pay Act. 

The  independent  Title  VII  authority  to  settle  EEO  claims  is  significant  because,  unlike 
the Back Pay Act, Section 717 of Title VII does not limit awards of back pay to situations 
where there has been a finding of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.  Thus, 
there is no impediment to an award of back pay as part of a settlement without a finding 
of discrimination. 

When  evaluating  the  risk  of  litigation  versus  the  cost  of  settlement,  agencies  should 
include the cost of a federal retirement annuity in their consideration, if an annuity would 

Management Directive 
12-3 

 
 
 
become  payable  immediately.    This  reflects  the  actual  cost  to  the  government  of  the 
proposed settlement and should be considered when deciding whether the settlement is in 
the  interest  of  the  government.    This  calculation  may  lead  an  agency  to  explore 
alternative  solutions,  such  as  purchasing  a  private  annuity.    The  purchase  of  a  private 
annuity  may  not  be  desirable  in  all  instances,  but  can  be  considered  as  a  possible 
alternative.  Following are some examples that reflect this calculation: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

An  employee  at  a  GS-14,  step  10,  separates  at  age  50  with  25  years  of 
service.    His  only  annuity  eligibility  is  for  a  deferred  annuity  at  age  62.  
The present value of this deferred benefit (when the employee is age 50) is 
$259,992.  If, under the terms of a settlement agreement, his separation is 
changed to an involuntary separation (thus entitling him to an immediate 
discontinued  service  retirement  benefit),  the  value  of  the  benefit  is 
$691,546.  Thus, the cost to the government resulting from the settlement 
is the difference, or an additional $431,554.  

An  employee  at  a  GS-14,  step  10,  separates  at  age  55  with  30  years  of 
service, and therefore is eligible for  an immediate annuity.  The value of 
this annuity is $843,800.  If, in settlement, she is retroactively promoted to 
a  GS-15,  step  10,  for  three  years,  the  value  of  her  annuity  becomes 
$992,669.  This means the settlement costs the government an additional 
$148,869 in retirement annuities.  

An  employee  at  GS-14,  step  10,  separates  at  age  56  with  30  years  of 
service  and  is  eligible  for  an  immediate  annuity  valued  at  $825,588.    If, 
pursuant to a settlement, he is retroactively considered a law enforcement 
officer for 20 years of his federal career, the value of his retirement benefit 
becomes  $1,027,344.    Thus,  the  settlement  adds  $201,756  to  the 
government's cost of his retirement.  

An  employee  at  a  GS-14,  step  10,  separates  at  age  50  with  25  years  of 
service.    When  the  employee  is  55,  the  value  of  her  deferred  annuity 
payable at age 62 is $364,653.  If the employee is returned to the agency’s 
rolls  for  five  years,  enabling  her  to  retire  immediately,  her  retirement 
benefit has a value of $1,044,361.  This settlement would add $679,708 to 
the government’s costs.  

In  settlement,  the  level  of  a  GS-12,  step  10,  employee  is  retroactively 
changed to GS-14, step 10, for a period of three years.  Assuming that she 
is entitled to an immediate annuity, the value of her retirement benefit is 
raised  from  $582,132  to  $817,945.    Thus,  the  additional  cost  to  the 
government of this settlement is $235,813.  

IV.  NO FINDING OF DISCRIMINATION NECESSARY FOR SETTLEMENTS  

It  has  long  been  the  practice  in  both  the  private  sector  and  the  federal  sector  for 

Management Directive 
12-4 

 
 
employers and agencies to enter into settlements that contain cash payments where there 
has been neither a finding of discrimination, either judicially or administratively, nor an 
admission by the employer or agency of any wrongdoing. 

The Comptroller General has supported these settlements, stating “it is beyond question 
that  an  agency  has  the  general  authority  to  informally  settle  a  discrimination  complaint 
and  to  award  back  pay  with  a  retroactive  promotion  or  reinstatement  in  an  informal 
settlement without a specific finding of discrimination.”  Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission,  Informal  Settlement  of  Discrimination  Complaints,  62  Comp.  Gen.  239, 
242 (1983). 

V. 

CASH AWARDS WITHOUT CORRESPONDING PERSONNEL ACTIONS  

Settlements of EEO disputes may contain monetary payments that are independent of any 
personnel  action,  provided  that  the  monetary  payment  does  not  exceed  the  amount  of 
back pay, attorney’s fees,4 costs, or damages5
 the employee would have been entitled to 
in the case if discrimination had been actually found.  

The  Comptroller  General  has  considered  settlements  of  EEO  disputes  comprised  of 
monetary payments unconnected to personnel actions on at least two occasions and held 
that they were authorized and appropriate:  

[W]e  conclude  that  Federal  agencies  have  the  authority  in  informally  settling 
discrimination complaints filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as 
amended,  to  make  awards  of  backpay,  attorney’s  fees,  or  costs,  without  a 
corresponding personnel action and without a finding of discrimination, provided 
that the amount of the award agreed upon must be related to backpay and may not 
exceed  the  maximum  amount  that  would  be  recoverable  under  Title  VII  if  a 
finding of discrimination were made. 

Id. at 244; Matter of Albert D. Parker, 64 Comp. Gen. 349 (1985). 

VI.  PERSONNEL ACTIONS WITH LUMP SUM PAYMENTS  

An agency may informally settle an EEO complaint by providing a lump sum payment as 

4 Attorney's fees are not available during the administrative process of complaints brought under the 

Age Discrimination in Employment Act or the Equal Pay Act.  

5  The  Commission  has  the  authority  to  award  compensatory  damages  during  the  administrative 
process.  Gibson v. West, 527 U.S. 212 (1999).  Agencies, therefore, are authorized to pay compensatory 
damages in a settlement during the administrative process.  Compensatory damages should be calculated 
separately from back pay, other benefits, and fees and are limited to no more than $300,000. 

Management Directive 
12-5 

 
 
 
                                                 
  
a  retroactive  personnel  action  in  lieu  of  back  pay.    As  long  as  the  settlement  does  not 
exceed the relief to which the complainant would be entitled if a finding of discrimination 
had been made, it is authorized.  

If the settlement provides for a retroactive personnel action, all appropriate contributions 
to the retirement funds must be made.  Settlements may resolve claims actually made and 
also  claims  that  could  be  made,  provided  that  the  factual  predicate  for  the  claims  that 
could be made has occurred.  For example, an agency may settle a complainant’s formal 
complaint, alleging failure to promote and include relief for the complainant’s retaliation 
claim, which has not been raised, except in the settlement discussions.  

Since  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991  provided  for  award  of  compensatory  damages  in 
appropriate cases, settlements often provide for one lump sum amount covering monetary 
relief, even when there is a personnel action involved as well.  In these cases, parties can 
agree  to  an  overall  figure  in  the  settlement  that  represents  damages,  back  pay,  and 
attorney’s fees.  That figure can reflect the maximum amount a  court  could  award, and 
need  not  be  limited  to  an  amount  that  the  agency  believes  a  complainant  can  prove  in 
court.  The settlement  agreement does not  need  to  contain a  separate breakdown  of the 
lump sum showing individual amounts of back pay, damages, and fees.  The lump sum 
agreed  to  by  the  parties  can  be  equal  to  or  less  than  the  total  amount  of  back  pay, 
damages, and fees  that  would be awarded if  a  finding of discrimination  were made.  A 
lump  sum  cannot,  under  any  circumstances,  exceed  the  amount  that  the  agency 
concludes,  in  light  of  the  facts  and  recognizing  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  litigation,  a 
court could award if a lawsuit were brought.  

If a lump sum settlement is intended to award enhanced retirement benefits as part of its 
terms, the rates of basic pay or grade and step deemed to be received by the complainant, 
and  the  periods  during  which  each  rate  of  pay  was  received,  must  be  specified  in  the 
settlement  terms.    OPM  advises  that  if  this  specific  information  is  not  set  out  in  the 
settlement document, the terms of the settlement will not be included in the calculation of 
the complainant's retirement benefits. 

VII.  IMPLEMENTING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS  

There may be some instances where a proposed informal settlement appears to be at odds 
with  normal  personnel  procedure  or  practice  contained  in  regulations  implementing 
Title 5  of  the  United  States  Code  or  processing  guidance  of  the  Office  of  Personnel 
Management.    Such  situations  could  arise  where  Office  of  Personnel  Management 
regulations or guidance foresee personnel actions taken in the normal course of business 
and  do  not  generally  discuss  personnel  actions  taken  pursuant  to  court  order  or  a 
settlement.    Title  VII  provides  authority  to  enter  into  settlements  of  EEO  complaints,6

6  As  noted  earlier  in  this  Chapter,  the  same  analysis  applies  to  EEO  complaints  filed  under  the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963. 

Management Directive 
12-6 

 
 
                                                 
 
and,  likewise,  Title  VII  provides  authority  for  agencies  to  effectuate  the  terms  of  those 
settlements.  

Chapter 32, Section 6(b) of OPM’s Guide to Processing Personnel Actions describes the 
procedure  for  documenting  personnel  actions  taken  as  the  result  of  a  settlement 
agreement,  court  order,  or  Commission  or  MSPB  decision.    The  purpose  of  this 
procedure is to protect the privacy of the employee. 

Rather  than  including  personal  and  irrelevant  settlement  information  on  the  employee's 
SF-50,  the  SF-50  may  be  processed  with  the  computer  code  “HAM.”    (“HAM”  is  a 
computer code that prints on the SF-50 a citation to 5 C.F.R. § 250.101.)  If an agency’s 
computer system does not permit the use of the citation “HAM,” then the SF-50 may cite 
to 5 C.F.R. § 250.101.  This section of the Code of Federal Regulations indicates that the 
personnel action is processed under an appropriate legal authority.

proceedings, the agency agrees, subject to a ten (10) working day advance request by the 
NC agency to take all necessary steps to procure the services of a qualified court reporter 
to  transcribe  investigative  proceedings  and  to  prepare  transcripts  of  those  proceedings.   
The  NC  agency  shall  not  arrange  and  provide  court  reporter  services  on  a 
reimbursable  basis.    All  arrangements  shall  be  made  by  the  agency  and  all  bills  for 
transcription services and transcripts shall be sent directly to the agency.  Such bills shall

time  frame  deemed  necessary  by  the  NC  agency,  but  not  later  than  ten  calendar  days 
from the date of the investigative proceeding. 

E. 

Procedure for Reimbursement 

Upon completion of the investigation, the NC agency shall present to the 
1. 
agency an itemized billing statement of the costs and expenses and the total hours 
expended  by  the  assigned  NC  agency  personnel  for  services  related  to  the 
investigation of the complaint pursuant to Part C. 4. a. of this Agreement. 

As appropriate, the itemized billing statement shall include a standard rate factor 
for employee benefits and administration (28%, as provided in Part C. 4. a. of this 
Agreement).    The  time  expended  by  the  assigned  NC  agency  personnel 
investigating the complaint shall include time spent in a travel status and for other 
time spent on the investigation either during or after normal duty hours. 

The  statement  shall  also  include  a  recitation  of  the  total  dollar  amount  to  be 
reimbursed to the NC agency by the agency.  Such amount shall be calculated by 
multiplying  the  total  hours  expended  by  the  official  hourly  rate  of  the  assigned 
NC  agency  personnel  based  on  the  individual’s  official  grade  and  step  and  in 
accordance with the applicable federal pay schedule.   

Upon  presentation  of  the  itemized  billing  statement,  collection  shall  be  effected 
by  the  NC  agency  via  the  U.S.  Treasury’s  intra-governmental  payment  and 
collection system (IPAC) using the following agency accounting data:

2. 
In the event that the complaint is settled, withdrawn by the complainant, or 
canceled by the agency prior to the NC agency’s completion of the investigation, 
the NC agency shall present the agency an itemized billing statement for all hours 
expended by the assigned NC agency personnel up to such time as the complaint 
is settled, withdrawn, or canceled and costs incurred by the NC agency. 

Travel expenses relating to the investigation shall be paid by the agency at 
3. 
General  Schedule  Administration rates as  travel is  performed.    Travel shall not 
be arranged and paid for by the NC agency on a reimbursable basis.  When 
the  agency’s  designated  contact  person  for  the  complaint  is  notified  by  the  NC 
agency that travel arrangements are necessary with respect to the investigation of 
the complaint, the contact person shall arrange or cause to be arranged all round-
trip  travel  arrangements  to  include  all  airline  scheduling  and  tickets,  lodging 
accommodations at the destination and authorized per diem.   

Prior  to  travel,  the  agency  shall  deliver  the  necessary  airline  tickets  (either  by 
paper or notification of availability of electronic ticket), confirmation of lodging 
arrangements,  and  any  travel  advance  as  authorized  by  the  Federal  Travel 
Regulations  to  the  designated  NC  agency  personnel.    Upon  completion  of  the 
travel, the NC agency shall present the agency with the necessary information and 
documents  for  the  agency  to  prepare  a  travel  claim  for  the  signature  of  the 
personnel  investigating  the  complaint.    The  agency  shall  promptly  process  and 
settle such travel claims. 

F. 

Agreement Effective Date, Term Modification, and Termination 

This  Agreement  will  become  effective  when  signed  by  both  the  agency  and  the  NC 
agency and will remain in effect until completion of the investigation and final payment 
of costs as set forth herein is made by the agency, the complaint is settled, withdrawn by 
the complainant or cancelled by the agency and final payment of costs as set forth herein 
is made by the agency.  The NC agency and the agency may modify this Agreement by 
written consent.  The NC agency or the agency may terminate this Agreement by giving 
30 days advance written notice to the other.  

Should a disagreement arise on the interpretation of the provisions of this agreement, or 
amendments and/or revisions thereto, that cannot be resolved at the operating level, the 
area(s) of disagreement shall be stated in writing by each party and presented to the other 
party  for consideration.   If agreement on interpretation is not reached  within thirty (30) 
days, the parties shall forward the written presentation of the disagreement to respective 
higher officials for appropriate resolution.

APPENDIX B  EEO-MD-110 
EEO COUNSELING TECHNIQUES 

This  attachment  can  be  used  to  develop  or  refine  counseling  techniques  when  traditional 
counseling  is  selected.    Below  are  suggested  methods  to  follow  in  each  step  of  the  counseling 
process. 

EEO counseling consists of the following steps: 

1. 
2.  
3. 
4. 
5. 

Preparing for the effort 
Holding discussions 
Assessing the situation 
Determining appropriate resolution technique(s) 
Using informal resolution technique(s) 

In  reviewing  each  step,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  remember  that  each  informal  resolution 
situation  will  be  different  and  each  EEO  Counselor  will  have  his/her  own  style.    There  will 
probably be times when the EEO Counselor will need to make modifications to fit the situation. 

A.  Meeting with the Aggrieved Person 

1. 

Initial Actions 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Upon  contact  by  an  aggrieved  person,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  record 
the date and set an appointment for the initial counseling session to discuss 
the dispute.  Before the initial meeting, the EEO Counselor should advise 
the  aggrieved  person  of  his/her  right  to  be  accompanied,  advised,  and 
represented  by  a  representative  at  any  stage  in  the  complaint  process, 
including 
reasonable 
accommodation(s) available throughout the EEO process.

Also,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  advise  the  aggrieved  person  that  the 
aggrieved  person  will  remain  anonymous  during  counseling  unless  s/he 
chooses not to remain anonymous.  29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(g). 

The  EEO  Counselor  should  begin  the  initial  meeting  with  the  aggrieved 
person by explaining the role of the EEO Counselor.  The EEO Counselor 
should then give him/her an opportunity to explain the problem.  The EEO 
Counselor  should  create  an  atmosphere  which

The  EEO  Counselor  should  listen  attentively  in  order  to  get  an 
understanding  of  the  issues  involved  (the  facts  as  the  aggrieved  person 
sees  them  and  the  action(s)  alleged  to  be  discriminatory).    Once  the 
aggrieved  person  has  had  the  opportunity  to  relate  the  dispute  fully,  the 
EEO  Counselor  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  define  the  claims(s)  and

basis(es) involved, determine if the problem comes under the purview of 
the anti-discrimination laws, and determine if special procedures apply.   

The  EEO  Counselor  should  find  out  if  the  aggrieved  person  tried  to 
resolve  the  problem  or  brought  the  problem  to  the  agency’s  attention 
before seeking counseling and, if so, how.  Part of the problem might be 
that  s/he  did  not  use  the  appropriate  mechanisms  to  handle  the  problem 
prior to seeking counseling and, if properly handled, the problem may be 
easily resolved. 

The  EEO  Counselor  should  ask  the  aggrieved  person  whether  s/he  is 
willing to meet with agency officials. 

If the dispute is to be handled under Part 1614, the EEO Counselor should 
provide the aggrieved person with an overview of informal counseling and 
the discrimination complaint process under Part  1614, including required 
notifications  and  time  frames,  and  answer  any  questions  s/he  may  have 
about counseling and the complaint process. 

If a dispute involves employment discrimination and the aggrieved person 
chooses to have his/her case processed by the agency, the EEO Counselor 
must  provide  counseling,  regardless  of  whether  the  EEO  Counselor 
believes the case has merit. 

2. 

Disputes Not Involving Discrimination 

After  listening  to  and  asking  questions  of  the  aggrieved  person,  it  may  become 
apparent  that  s/he  is  not  alleging  discrimination  on  one  or  more  of  the  bases 
protected by the anti-discrimination laws.  For example, a person may allege that 
s/he was the target of reprisal for union activities.  In the absence of facts to show 
that the union activities are related to participation in protected EEO activities or 
related  to opposing  discriminatory practices,  the  EEO  Counselor  can  offer other 
alternatives for redress.   

3. 

Disputes Involving Prohibited Discrimination 

When  the  dispute  involves  an  allegation  of  discrimination,  the  EEO  Counselor 
should proceed with the initial counseling session and do the following: 

a. 

Determine whether special procedures  apply (i.e., mixed case, negotiated 
grievance procedure, or age).  Also, advise the aggrieved individual how 
the  agency’s EEO alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process works in 
counseling  and  of  the  aggrieved  person’s  option  to  choose  EEO  ADR 
during  the  counseling  stage  of  the  process  where  the  agency  agrees  to 
offer EEO ADR in the particular case.

person will accept to resolve the problem.  Suppose the aggrieved person 
will accept being placed at the top of the agency’s waiting list for the next 
available  opening.    The  EEO  Counselor  may  be  able  to  resolve  this 
dispute  by  presenting  the  offer  to  agency  officials  as  a  first  step.    If  the 
agency  agrees,  the  EEO  Counselor  has  avoided  the  need  to  formulate  a 
resolution strategy. 

Learning  early  on  exactly  what  it  is  that  the  aggrieved  person  is  seeking 
may  well  provide  the  basis  for  a  prompt  resolution  and  save  everyone 
time. 

Make sure the aggrieved person understands that s/he cannot be forced to 
agree to any proposed solutions or to reach an agreement with the agency 
and that s/he may file a formal complaint. 

Conclude  the  initial  EEO  counseling  session  by  making  sure  that  the 
procedural  requirements  of  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614  were  followed  and  that 
enough information was obtained to attempt resolution. 

B.  Meeting with Agency Officials  

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Explain the aggrieved person's allegations and summarize the reasons or facts s/he 
gave  for  believing  there  has  been  discrimination.    The  aggrieved  person’s  name 
can be used only if anonymity has been waived in writing. 

Explain or answer any questions about EEO counseling and the federal complaint 
process.    Emphasize  that  the  EEO  Counselor’s  role  is  to  attempt  to  resolve  a 
dispute.  If counseling is successful and resolution is reached, then the need to file 
a formal complaint is avoided. 

Give the agency an opportunity to present its position on the matters raised by the 
aggrieved person and ask agency officials to suggest ways the problem might be 
resolved. 

Try  to  get  a  sense  of  the  relationship  between  the  aggrieved  person  and  the 
responding  agency  official  (assuming  the  aggrieved  person  did  not  request 
anonymity).  Is the relationship hostile, perhaps because of past dealings?  Is the 
agency official interested in meeting with the aggrieved person?

Make  sure  that  agency  officials  understand  that  the  agency  cannot  be  forced  to 
enter into an agreement as a result of EEO counseling. 

C. 

Considering Factors in Situation 

The  EEO  Counselor’s  approach  to  a  given  situation  will  depend  on  several  factors, 
including the following: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Nature  of  the  alleged  discriminatory  acts  and  characteristics  of  the  dispute 
between the parties. 

Relationship between the aggrieved person and the agency.  

Whether  the  EEO  Counselor  must  gather  facts  beyond  those  provided  by  the 
aggrieved person and the agency. 

Acceptance  by  the  aggrieved  person  and  the  agency  of  various  resolution 
techniques. 

5. 

The EEO Counselor’s willingness to participate in various resolution techniques.  

D. 

Conducting the Inquiry  

1. 

Focus on the Issue(s) and Basis(es) 

The  EEO  Counselor  may  be  required  to  interview  witnesses  and  review  agency 
records.    An  inquiry  into  an  EEO  dispute  begins  when  the  EEO  Counselor 
attempts  to  gather  information  following  the  initial  meeting  with  the  aggrieved 
person.    Upon  completion  of  this  initial  meeting  with  the  aggrieved  person,  the 
claim(s)  raised  should  be  clearly  defined  and  the  basis(es),  i.e.,  race,  color,  sex 
(including  equal  pay,  pregnancy,  transgender,  and  sex  stereotypes),  religion, 
national  origin,  age,  reprisal,  genetic  information,  and/or  disability,  identified.   
The EEO Counselor should keep in mind that the aggrieved person is best able to 
assist in defining the issue(s) since s/he is an involved party.  The EEO Counselor 
should not conclude an initial interview with the aggrieved party without a clear 
understanding of the issue(s) and basis(es).   

The  direction  the  inquiry  will  take  depends  upon  the  EEO  Counselor’s 
understanding  of  the  issue(s)  and  basis(es).    If  the  issue(s)  involves  a  personnel 
action,  it  will  be  necessary  to  identify  the  action  with  as  much  specificity  as 
possible.    For  example,  if  the  aggrieved  person  alleges  discrimination  in  a 
promotion action, the EEO Counselor must at least determine the position applied 
for,  and  whether  the  aggrieved  person  was  qualified,  was  on  the  list  of  best 
qualified  candidates,  was  interviewed,  and  whether  a  selection  was  made.    This 
information will help to focus the inquiry on the specific portion of the personnel 
action at issue.  The EEO Counselor must include dates to ensure that the dispute 

Management Directive 
App. B-4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

Appendix B  MD-110 

was  raised  in  a  timely  manner.    For  those  issues  that  involve  actions  other  than 
personnel  actions  documented  by  an  SF-50,  the  data  gathering  approach  is  the 
same, but gathering information can be more difficult. 

2. 

Data Gathering from Witnesses and Agency Records 

a. 

Once the claims(s) and basis(es) are defined, the EEO Counselor will need 
to  determine  if  it  is  necessary  to  gather  information  from  sources  other 
than  the  aggrieved  person  and  agency  representative  in  order  to  attempt 
resolution.    Potential  sources  of  information  could  include  witnesses  and 
written documentation or records. 

If  the  EEO  Counselor  determines  that  witness  interviews  are  necessary, 
s/he should attempt to interview witnesses who have direct knowledge of a 
particular situation.   The EEO Counselor should limit witness  interviews 
to  those  persons  who  can  provide  information  that  will  help  the  EEO 
Counselor  better  understand  the  dispute  so  that  resolution  can  be 
attempted.    Sometimes  witness  interviews  will  be  the  only  source  of 
information  other  than  information  obtained  from  the  aggrieved  person 
and  the  agency.    Such  disputes  would  include  allegations  of  harassment, 
either  sexual  or  otherwise,  or  situations  where  the  issue  raised  is  one  of 
inappropriate conduct or treatment based on a prohibited reason.   

b. 

Early in the process, the EEO Counselor must determine what documents 
control the action taken; i.e., whether there is a written agency procedure 
that  must  be  followed  in  certain  situations.    For  example,  if  the  issue 
involves  a  promotion  action,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  decide  if  it  is 
necessary  to  review  the  applicable  promotion  plan  and,  if  so,  determine 
where the plan is maintained.  The EEO Counselor may be able to obtain 
needed information  from  official personnel folders, supervisors’ working 
files, or wherever the personnel action is maintained, such as a promotion 
folder.    By  making  inquiries,  the  EEO  Counselor  will  soon  learn  where 
such documents are kept and who maintains the records. 

When  looking  at  individual  records,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  keep  in 
mind  that  his/her  role  is  to  achieve  informal  resolution  at  the  lowest 
possible  level,  so  the  number  of  records  reviewed  should  be  kept  to  a 
minimum.    Only  records  of  the  aggrieved  person  and  of  those  who 
allegedly received different, more favorable treatment should be examined 
in an effort to achieve informal resolution. 

The EEO Counselor’s first contact may be at the personnel office, but the 
EEO  Counselor  may  determine  other  sources  for  obtaining  needed 
documents. 

Management Directive 
App. B-5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix B  EEO MD-110 

August, 2015 

For situations which EEO Counselors encounter often, the following types 
of issues will require review of certain records:   

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

Promotion  -  The  promotion  folder  should  include  the  vacancy 
announcement, job description, ranking/rating factors, and SF- 171 
or  applications  of  at  least  the  aggrieved  person  and  the  selectee.   
The EEO Counselor should notify the personnel office that an EEO 
inquiry  was  made  concerning  a  promotion  action.    The  EEO 
Counselor should request that documents relating to the promotion 
action, which might ordinarily be destroyed, be retained while the 
inquiry is pending.   

Time  and  Attendance  -  Agency  regulations/orders  on  time  and 
attendance,  time  and  attendance  records  of  the  aggrieved  person 
and person(s) the aggrieved person is comparing himself/herself to, 
and how each is treated. 

Training  -  Agency  procedures  for  requesting  and  recommending 
training, any forms required, and training approved or denied with 
reason(s). 

Appraisal/Rating  -  Agency  regulations/orders  on  system  imple-
mentation  and  administration,  elements  and  standards,  perfor-
mance  requirements,  rating  of  the  aggrieved  person,  and  ratings 
prepared  by  same  rating  and/or  reviewing  official  of  similarly 
situated employees. 

c. 

In  reviewing  documentation,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  copy  only 
documents  needed  in  the  discussions  that  will  follow  the  initial  inquiry.   
Notes  should  be  kept,  but  the  identity  of  comparators  should  not  be 
revealed  to  the  aggrieved  person.    Review  of  documents  should  be 
restricted to those that relate to the issue(s) raised by the aggrieved person 
and are necessary to resolve the concerns informally at the lowest possible 
level.  

EEO counseling will often involve the use of various techniques to bring 
about early resolution.  For example, it may include: 

(1) 

(2) 

Holding  separate  meetings,  followed  by  joint  meetings,  and  then 
telephone contact to work out details of an agreement; 

Holding  a  joint  meeting  to  set  forth  the  facts  as  both  sides  see 
them, followed by separate meetings with the parties in which the 
various possibilities for resolution are explored; or 

(3) 

Conducting  a  conference  call  or  separate  telephone  calls  to  the 

Management Directive

parties during which the dispute is resolved.  Care should be taken 
to protect anonymity unless waived.

Developing a Resolution Strategy for 30-Day Counseling Period 

1. 

Joint Meetings (An aggrieved person must agree to a joint meeting) 

a. 

Advantages: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

Gives  the  aggrieved  person  and  the  agency  an  opportunity  to 
present  the  facts  as  each  sees  them  and  to  clarify  points  of 
confusion or misunderstanding. 

Gives the parties an opportunity to explore directly with each other 
the means for resolving issues underlying the problems. 

Helps  the  parties  establish  a  more  constructive  working  relation-
ship by getting a better understanding of each other’s concerns. 

Enables  the  parties  to  “shake  hands”  on  any  agreements  reached 
and to work together to put them in writing. 

Allows  the  EEO  Counselor  better  control  of  the  process,  making 
sure  that  the  parties  treat  each  other  as  equals  and  that  threats  or 
coercion are not used. 

b. 

Disadvantages: 

(1) 

Risks  a  blow-up,  a  hardening  of  positions,  and  increased 
antagonism. 

(2)  May  require  the  parties  to  call  a  recess  to  explore  changes  in 

position with others (e.g., counsel). 

(3)  May be difficult to schedule. 

(4) 

Can be costly when the parties are in different locations. 

c. 

The EEO Counselor Should Use This Approach When: 

(1) 

(2) 

The  parties’  positions  are  based  on  different  facts  or  different 
perceptions of the same facts. 

The parties have not had an opportunity to talk with each other or 
would like a way to reopen discussions.

2. 

Separate Meetings 

a. 

Advantages: 

(1) 

Allows  the  EEO  Counselor  to  learn  more  about  the  parties’ 
specific concerns and priorities. 

(2) 

Allows the EEO Counselor to explore alternatives. 

(3) 

Allows the parties to ask questions they do not want to ask in front 
of the other party. 

(4) 

Prevents the possibility of intimidation. 

(5)  May be easier to schedule than a joint meeting. 

b. 

Disadvantages: 

(1)  May lead the parties to wonder what the EEO Counselor is saying 

to the other side. 

(2) 

Unless  the  resolution  reached  through  separate  meetings  is  re-
stated in a joint meeting or through a conference call, the parties do

The EEO Counselor needs to help one or both parties be realistic 
about possible solutions.

The parties are in different locales and are not logistically able to 
meet face to face. 

The issues are comparatively easy to deal with, such as those based 
on a misunderstanding or incorrect information. 

The  EEO  Counselor  needs  more  information  to  determine  if 
counseling is productive, and scheduling a meeting for this purpose 
is too time-consuming.

4. 

Attempting Resolution 

When the EEO Counselor has a good grasp of the issues involved and has decided 
on  which  EEO  counseling  technique  to  use,  s/he  is  ready  to  attempt  resolution.   
Resolution of  an EEO problem means  that  the aggrieved  person and the  agency 
come  to  terms  with  a  problem  and  agree  on  a  solution.    The  EEO  Counselor 
should  generally  concentrate  on  resolving  individual  cases  independently;  but, 
when  appropriate,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  ask  for  assistance  from  the  EEO 
Director  in  reaching  a  solution  or  correcting  a  problem.    When  asking  the  EEO 
Director for  help,  the EEO Counselor should relate what s/he has learned  in the 
inquiry (using the aggrieved person’s name only if s/he has given permission) and 
be prepared to recommend specific action. 

There is no set formula for a EEO Counselor to follow in attempting a resolution 
using  the  techniques  described.    The  EEO  Counselor  can  attempt  resolution  by 
talking with the parties separately or together.  The EEO Counselor can talk with 
them together only if the aggrieved person has given permission; otherwise, they 
must be spoken with separately.  

The  following  subsections  highlight  barriers  faced  when  attempting  resolution 
and  provide  guidance  on  how  to  attempt  resolution  using  the  EEO  counseling 
techniques of joint meetings, separate meetings, and telephone communication. 

5. 

Obstacles to Informal Resolution 

In  order  to  resolve  an  EEO  dispute,  the  agency  and  the  aggrieved  person  must 
agree  on  a  solution.    However,  only  the  agency  has  the  authority  to  resolve  an 
EEO dispute.  Like most situations involving two parties, the EEO Counselor can 
expect obstacles to resolution of EEO disputes.  These obstacles can be put up by 
both  parties.    The  challenge  is  to  overcome  these  obstacles  and  work  out  a 
solution. 

Sometimes obstacles can be overcome by bringing the parties together and having 
them candidly discuss their attitude toward working out a solution.  Other times, 
obstacles can be lessened by helping the parties explore possible outcomes if the 
dispute is escalated to the formal complaint level.  However, the EEO Counselor 
must recognize that not all obstacles can be overcome and attempts at resolution 
should  end  when  it  is  apparent  that  the  parties  are  unable  to  come  to  an 
agreement. 

a. 

Some agency obstacles are listed below: 

(1) 

“There was no discrimination so nothing should be done.” 

(2) 

“The  decision  at  issue  was  correctly  made,  procedures  were 
correct, and nothing should be done for the aggrieved person.” 

Management Directive 
App. B-10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August, 2015 

Appendix B  MD-110 

(3) 

“Resolution will encourage frivolous complaints.” 

(4) 

“Subordinates and supervisors will lose respect for a manager who 
settles rather than fights.” 

b. 

Aggrieved persons may also impose obstacles to successful resolutions of 
problems.  Such obstacles may include: 

(1) 

“Discrimination must be punished.” 

(2) 

“My manager must be disciplined.” 

(3) 

“My manager must apologize.” 

(4) 

“No remedy is sufficient.” 

(5) 

“The  agency  must  pay  punitive 
damages.”1

F. 

Attempting Resolution Using the Joint Meeting Technique  

This  subsection  outlines  the  steps  and  activities  involved  in  arranging  and  conducting 
joint  meetings.    The  EEO  Counselor  should  make  sure  the  aggrieved  person  has 
consented to joint meetings with the agency before arranging a joint meeting. 

1. 

Arranging a Joint EEO Counseling Session 

a. 

b. 

c. 

The EEO Counselor should select a location convenient for both parties. 

The  EEO  Counselor  should  arrange  a  date  and  time  convenient  to  both 
parties, but as soon as possible. 

If there does not seem to be a mutually acceptable time for the parties to 
meet, consider the following questions: 

(1) 

(2) 

Is there a suitable and feasible alternative to the joint meeting?  If 
so, the EEO Counselor should use it. 

Does the scheduling problem appear to be real, or does it appear to 
be a delaying tactic?

(4) 

If  the  scheduling  problem  appears  to  be  real,  how  do  the  parties 
feel  about  postponing  the  meeting?    Would  a  request  for  an 
extension make resolution within 30 days impossible? 

If the scheduling problem is more of a delaying tactic and if there 
is  no  suitable  alternative  to  a  joint  meeting,  the  EEO  Counselor 
should terminate counseling.   

The EEO Counselor should determine who will be attending the meeting 
and let all parties know who will be present. 

The EEO Counselor should let the parties know the way the meeting will 
be  run  and  suggest  ways  the  parties  can  prepare  for  the  meeting.    Each 
party  should  understand  that  the  EEO  Counselor  chairs  the  meeting  but 
will  not  take  a  position  on  the  merits  of  either  party’s  position  or  the 
merits  of  any  proposed  solutions  made  by  the  parties,  and  that  the  EEO 
Counselor will not make decisions for the parties. 

The  EEO  Counselor should explain that the purpose of the meeting is to 
provide each party with an opportunity to present the facts and problems 
as  each  sees  them,  to  clarify  the  issues,  to  establish  points  of  agreement 
and disagreement, and to explore the possibility of some form of voluntary 
resolution acceptable to both parties.  

The EEO Counselor should suggest that the parties review the facts of the 
case as they know them and think about what it would take to resolve the 
problem as they see it. 

The EEO Counselor should point out the confidentiality of discussions to 
both parties. 

If, at the last minute, one of the parties calls to cancel, the EEO Counselor 
should try to determine if the reason is legitimate.  If it appears it is, the 
EEO Counselor should reschedule the meeting as quickly as possible.  If 
rescheduling  becomes  a  problem,  an  alternative  to  the  joint  meeting 
should be explored.  If there is a question about the reason for cancellation 
or  if  a  party  cancels  more  than  one  meeting,  the  EEO  Counselor  should 
decide whether informal resolution efforts should be terminated.

Make sure everyone at the table knows everyone else and the reason each 
person is there. 

Set  the  tone  and  establish  ground  rules.    This  is  the  time  to  restate  the 
purpose  of  the  meeting,  the  EEO  Counselor’s  role,  and  the  role  and 
responsibility of the parties.   

Work with the parties toward resolution.   

Prepare to handle the unexpected. 

(1) 

(2) 

If  one  party  does  not  appear  for  the  meeting,  the  EEO  Counselor 
should  find  out  why.    Discuss  the  issues  involved  with  the  party 
who  does  appear.    Try  to  get  a  sense  of  what  it  would  take  to 
resolve  the  dispute.    See  if  the  party  is  interested  in  continuing 
EEO counseling and is willing to reschedule the meeting. 

If one of the parties is about to break off discussions and leave in a 
huff, the EEO Counselor should try to calm the  parties down and 
do the following: 

- 

- 

- 

Help  both  parties  save  face  by  getting  them  to  put  aside 
emotions and address the problem. 

Talk to the parties separately, if necessary. 

Not dwell on the incident if discussions resume, but remind 
the  parties  that  a  resolution  does  not  have  to  be  achieved 
and that it is okay to agree to disagree and to end informal 
resolution.  The EEO Counselor can  explain  to  the  parties 
that a decision to end informal resolution efforts should be 
a  conscious,  deliberate  one,  not  one  simply  made  in  a 
moment of anger. 

f. 

If one of the parties accuses the EEO Counselor of bias and asks the EEO 
Counselor  to  leave,  the  EEO  Counselor  should  leave  provided  the  other 
party is willing to continue the meeting without the EEO Counselor.  If the 
other party is not willing to continue, the meeting should be adjourned. 

(1) 

Later,  if  appropriate,  the  EEO  Counselor  can  clarify  what 
happened and try to regain acceptance.  

(2) 

Apologize for any misconceptions that might have been created. 

(3) 

Decide whether to terminate EEO counseling.

Ending the Joint EEO Counseling Session 

A joint EEO counseling session can end in one of the following ways: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

With a resolution.  The EEO Counselor should explain that s/he will draw 
up a written agreement to be signed by both parties. 

Without  resolution  but  with  an  agreement  to  keep  trying.    The  EEO 
Counselor should explain that she will arrange the next meeting.  Keep in 
mind the requirement, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(d), to conduct the 
final  interview  no  later  than  the  30th  day  of  initial  contact  by  the 
aggrieved  person,  unless  the  aggrieved  person  and  the  EEO  Director  (or 
his delegate) agrees in writing to postpone the final interview.  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105(e). 

Without  a  resolution  and  with  a  decision  to  end  EEO  counseling.    The 
EEO  Counselor  should  explain  to  the  aggrieved  person  that  s/he  will  set 
up  a  final  counseling  session  at  which  time  the  EEO  Counselor  will 
explain the next steps. 

The EEO Counselor should make sure that each party  agrees on the way 
the meeting is ending.

Attempting Resolution Using the Separate Meeting Technique 

1.  What Should Be Done Up Front 

Separate  EEO  counseling sessions with  each  party  can  be used  in  place  of or to 
supplement joint meetings.  If separate meetings are to be used, the parties should 
know:  

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

That the EEO Counselor will be meeting separately with the parties. 

The purpose of the meetings. 

That what is said in the meetings is intended to be confidential. 

That  the  EEO  Counselor  will  not  serve  as  an  advisor  to  the  parties  or 
comment directly on the substance of a proposal. 

2. 

Handling Special Situations 

The  following  paragraphs  describe  situations  which  may  occur  in  separate 
meetings and suggest ways each situation might be handled.

Appendix B  MD-110 

a. 

The agency concedes directly or indirectly that there may be some merit to 
what the aggrieved person sees as a problem. 

(1) 

The  EEO  Counselor  can  explore  alternative  solutions  to  the 
problem,  for  example,  suggesting  that  the  agency  consult  with 
appropriate officials  to review the dispute  and merits with  a view 
towards  possible  resolution.    The  EEO  Counselor  should  consult 
with  his/her  EEO  Director  to  discuss  the  dispute  before  a 
suggestion is made to the agency to consult with legal counsel. 

(2) 

The EEO Counselor must be careful not to prejudge a case because 
a formal investigation may not find the situation to be as the parties 
described it. 

(3) 

The  EEO  Counselor  may  assist  the  agency  and  the  aggrieved 
person in reaching an acceptable resolution of the dispute. 

b. 

The aggrieved person concedes directly or indirectly that there may be no 
merit to the allegations.  (S/he thinks that there was unfair treatment, but it 
may  not  have  been  in  violation  of  the  anti-discrimination  laws  and 
regulations.)  In such a case, the EEO Counselor can examine alternative 
solutions to the problem. 

c. 

The parties may ask the EEO Counselor for his/her opinion regarding the 
strength of the allegation.  The EEO Counselor should: 

(1) 

Inform  the  parties  that  s/he  cannot  comment  on  the  strength  or 
weakness of a given situation.  

(2) 

Let the parties judge the strength and weakness of an allegation. 

H. 

Attempting Resolution Using Telephone Communication 

The general procedures outlined for joint and separate meetings also apply to telephone 
conference calls and separate telephone calls to each party.  However, at the start of the 
conversation the EEO Counselor should:  

1. 

2. 

Ask if anyone else is on the line. 

Remind parties that recording the conversation is prohibited.

APPENDIX C  EEO-MD-110 
EEO COUNSELOR CHECKLIST 

At  the  initial  counseling  session,  EEO  Counselors  must  advise  individuals  in  writing  of  their 
rights and responsibilities.  At a minimum those rights include the following: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

g. 

h. 

The right to anonymity. 

The  right  to  representation  throughout  the  complaint  process 
including the counseling stage.  The EEO Counselor should make 
clear  to  the  aggrieved  person  that  the  EEO  Counselor  is  not  an 
advocate  for  either  the  aggrieved  person  or  the  agency,  but  acts 
strictly as a neutral in the EEO process. 

The right to choose between the agency’s EEO alternative dispute 
resolution  (ADR)  process  or  EEO  counseling,  where  the  agency 
agrees  to  offer  EEO  ADR  in  the  particular  case,  and  information 
about each procedure. 

The possible election requirement between a negotiated grievance 
procedure  and  the  EEO  complaint  procedure.    See  Chapter  4, 
Section III of this Management Directive. 

The  election  requirement  in  the  event  that  the  claim  at  issue  is 
appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), i.e., the 
dispute  is  a  mixed  case.    See  Chapter  4,  Section  II  of  this 
Management Directive. 

The requirement that the aggrieved person file a complaint within 
15  calendar  days  of  receipt  of  the  EEO  Counselor’s  Notice  of 
Right to File a Formal Complaint in the event s/he wishes to file a 
formal complaint at the conclusion of counseling or EEO ADR. 

The right to file a notice of intent to sue when age is alleged as a 
basis for discrimination and of the right to file a lawsuit under the 
ADEA 
instead  of  an  administrative  complaint  of  age 
discrimination, pursuant to § 1614.201(a). 

The  right  to  go  directly  to  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  on 
claims of sex-based wage discrimination under the Equal Pay Act 
even though such claims are also cognizable under Title VII.1

1  Sex-based  claims  of  wage  discrimination  may  also  be  raised  under  Title  VII;  individuals  so 
aggrieved may thus claim violations of both statutes simultaneously.  Equal Pay Act complaints may be 
processed administratively under Part 1614.  In the alternative, a complainant in the EPA claim may go 
directly to a court of competent jurisdiction.

APPENDIX D  EEO-MD-110 
INFORMATION ON OTHER PROCEDURES 

A.  

Negotiated Grievance Procedures in Collective Bargaining Agreements 

1. 

Aggrieved Person Makes Election  

At the initial counseling session, the EEO Counselor must  inform  the aggrieved 
person of the possible applicability of the election of remedies provisions from the 
Civil  Service  Reform  Act  of  1978,  5  U.S.C.  §  7121(d),  concerning  negotiated 
grievance procedures. 

a. 

In order for an aggrieved person to be covered under 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d), 
both of the following conditions must be met: 

(1) 

(2) 

S/he  must  be  employed  in  a  federal  agency  subject  to  the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d); and 

S/he must be covered  by a collective bargaining  agreement  at the 
agency  where  the  grievance  arises.    The  agreement  must  also 
permit allegations  of discrimination to be  raised  in the  negotiated 
grievance procedure. 

b. 

If  these  conditions  are  met,  then  the  EEO  Counselor  must  inform  the 
aggrieved  person  that  5  U.S.C.  §  7121(d)  applies.    This  means  that  the 
aggrieved  person  must  be  informed  of  the  requirement  that  s/he  choose 
one (not both) of the following: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

a  right  to  have  his/her  allegations  of  discrimination  addressed  in 
the  negotiated  grievance  procedure  of  the  collective  bargaining 
agreement with a caution  that the opportunity to raise allegations 
of discrimination will be lost if not raised in the grievance process; 
or 

a  right  to  have  his/her  allegations  of  discrimination  addressed 
under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.   

An  election  to  proceed  under  Part  1614  is  indicated  only  by  the 
filing of a formal complaint, in writing.  Use of the pre-complaint 
process does not constitute an election to proceed under Part 1614. 

Allegations  of  discrimination  that  are  raised  by  employees  not 
covered  by  5  U.S.C.  §  7121(d)  are  to  be  processed  as  EEO 
complaints  under  Part  1614  regardless  of  whether  they  are  also 
pursuing  a  grievance  on  the  same  claim  (for  example,  a  five-day 

Management Directive

suspension  from  work)  under  a  collective  bargaining  agreement 
not covered by 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d).1

(a) 

(b) 

Under  §  1614.301(c),  the  complaint  may  be  held  in 
abeyance  while  the  grievance  on  the  same  claim  is 
processed.    The  abeyance  shall  terminate  without  further 
notice  upon  the  issuance  of  a  final  decision  on  the 
grievance.  The complaint may be held in abeyance only if 
the aggrieved is provided written notice of the abeyance. 

The  notice  of  abeyance  shall  state  that  the  abeyance  is 
instituted pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.301(c) and that time 
limits for processing the complaint contained in  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.106 and for appeal to the Commission contained in 
29  C.F.R.  § 1614.402  will  also  be  held  in  abeyance  until 
fifteen  (15)  days  following  the  issuance  of  the  final 
decision on the grievance. 

(c) 

If  the  EEO  complaint  is  held  in  abeyance,  the  time  limits 
for processing are tolled until a final decision is rendered in 
the grievance process. 

2. 

Election Is Final 

a. 

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.301, EEO Counselors are required to inform 
an aggrieved person that once s/he decides which forum s/he will use the 
negotiated  grievance  procedure  in  a  collective  bargaining  agreement 
covered  by  5  U.S.C.  §  7121(d)  or  Part  1614  the  aggrieved  person  is 
precluded  from  using  the  other  forum  to  address  the  same  claim.    This 
preclusion  holds  regardless  of  whether  discrimination  is  actually  raised.   
For  example, if  an  aggrieved person  elects  to have  a  dispute  involving a 
claim  of  discrimination  addressed  under  the  terms  of  a  collective 
bargaining  agreement  by  filing  a  grievance,  s/he  could  not  also  file  a 
formal  complaint  of  discrimination  under  Part  1614  on  the  same  claim.   
This  bar  to  a  subsequent  formal  EEO  complaint  would  hold  true  even  if 
the  complainant  failed to raise the  discrimination claim in the  grievance, 
as long as the  grievance process could have addressed the discrimination 
allegations. 

b. 

If  an  agency  issues  a  decision  rejecting  the  grievance  either  because  the 
individual  is  not  covered  by  the  collective  bargaining  agreement,  the 
collective  bargaining  agreement  does  not  contain  a  provision  that  allows 
allegations of discrimination to be raised in the grievance process, or the

grievance was untimely filed, the agency shall include appeal rights to the 
Commission.  The case shall be processed as a complaint under Part 1614.  
29 C.F.R. § 1614.301(b). 

3. 

Appeals 

Unless  the  grievance  is  a  mixed  case,  the  complainant  has  the  right  to  appeal  a 
final decision on his/her grievance that contains a discrimination allegation to the 
Commission as provided in subpart D of 29 C.F.R. Part 1614.  If the grievance is 
a mixed case, the complainant has the right to appeal to MSPB. 

B.  Mixed Cases 

1. 

MSPB Mixed Case Complaints and Appeals 

In addition to negotiated grievance procedures, an aggrieved person may present 
an  allegation  that  constitutes  a  mixed  case.    A  mixed  case  is  one  which  alleges 
discrimination in connection with a claim which is also appealable to the MSPB.  
Two criteria determine whether a case is a mixed case. 

a. 

b. 

The employee has standing to file an appeal to the MSPB; and  

The allegations which form the basis of the discrimination complaint can 
be appealed to the MSPB.   

For  information  on  who  can  file  and  the  actions  that  can  be  appealed  to  the 
MSPB, see 5 C.F.R. § 1201.3. 

2. 

Choosing a Forum 

If  both  criteria  for  a  mixed  case  are  met,  the  EEO  Counselor  must  notify  an 
aggrieved  person  that  s/he  must  choose  the  forum  in  which  s/he  wishes  to 
proceed.    Where  a  negotiated  grievance  can  also  be  filed,  the  EEO  Counselor 
must  explain  that  the  aggrieved  person  must  choose  to  proceed  in  one  of  three 
forums:  the  MSPB  appeal  process,  the  internal  EEO  process,  or  the  negotiated 
grievance process (see Section A.1 above). 

a. 

b. 

The  EEO  Counselor  is  initially  responsible  for  identifying  mixed  cases 
and for advising aggrieved persons of their right to pursue the claim as a 
mixed  case  complaint  or  as  a  mixed  case  appeal.    The  EEO  Counselor 
must identify mixed cases early in order to ensure that aggrieved persons 
are fully informed of their complaint processing options.   

An aggrieved person may choose to raise allegations of discrimination in a 
mixed case either as an appeal to the MSPB (“mixed case appeal”) or as a 
discrimination  complaint  with  the  agency  under  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614

(“mixed  case  complaint”)  but  not  both.    Whichever  action  the  employee 
files first is considered an election to proceed in that forum.  

An  election  to  proceed  under  29  C.F.R.  Part  1614  is  made  when  the 
aggrieved  person  files  a  formal  complaint  in  writing.    Use  of  the  EEO 
counseling process is not an election to proceed under Part 1614. 

If an employee chooses to file an appeal with the MSPB on a mixed case, 
the  agency  must  thereafter  dismiss  any  subsequently  filed  complaint  on 
the same claim, regardless of whether the allegations of discrimination are 
raised in the appeal to the MSPB.  Upon dismissal, the agency must advise 
the employee to raise the allegations of discrimination in connection with 
his/her appeal to the MSPB. 

the  mixed  case  complaint 

Where  the  agency  disputes  MSPB  jurisdiction,  (for  timeliness,  coverage, 
or  any  other  reason),  the  agency  shall  notify  the  complainant  that  it  is 
holding 
the  MSPB 
Administrative Judge rules on the jurisdictional issue.  During this period, 
all  time  limitations  for  processing  or  filing  will  be  tolled.    An  agency 
decision to hold a mixed case complaint in abeyance is not appealable to 
the Commission.   

in  abeyance  until 

If  the  MSPB  Administrative  Judge  finds  that  the  MSPB  has  jurisdiction 
over the  claim, the agency shall dismiss  the mixed case complaint under 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.107(a)(4). 

If the employee elects to file a mixed case complaint under Part 1614, the 
agency  must  process  the  complaint  in  a  manner  substantially  similar  to 
any  other  discrimination  complaint,  except  that  the  employee  is  not 
entitled  to  a  hearing  before  a  Commission  Administrative  Judge.    An 
aggrieved  person’s  appeal  rights  will  be  to  the  MSPB,  not  the 
Commission.    Following  a  final  decision  from  the  MSPB,  an  aggrieved 
person  may  petition  the  Commission  to  consider  that  decision  as  it 
pertains to the allegations of discrimination. 

3. 

Constructive Discharge 

constructive  discharge  occurs  when 

A  discriminatory 
employer 
discriminatorily  creates  working  conditions  that  are  so  difficult,  unpleasant,  or 
intolerable that a reasonable person in the aggrieved person’s position would feel 
compelled to resign.  In other words, the aggrieved person is essentially forced to 
resign under circumstances where the resignation is tantamount to the employer’s 
termination or discharge of the employee. 

the 

Similarly, in coerced or involuntary retirement cases, the aggrieved person alleges 
that  s/he  was  essentially  forced  to  retire,  for  example,  because  of  age,  and  the

retirement  decision  was  not  voluntary.    Discriminatory  coercion  or  involuntary 
retirement  allegations  are,  if  supported,  tantamount  to  the  employer  discharging 
the employee. 

a. 

MSPB dismissal may “unmix” a case 

An  employee  with  MSPB  appeal  rights  who  alleges  that  s/he  was 
retirement  because  of 
constructively  discharged  or  coerced 
discrimination should be advised to file a mixed case complaint or a mixed 
case  appeal.    Where  the  merits  of  the  claim  of  discrimination  cannot  be 
reached  for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  the  case  will  be  considered  no  longer 
mixed. 

into 

b. 

An unmixed appealBreferral to counseling 

If an aggrieved person files a mixed case appeal  with the MSPB and the 
MSPB  dismisses  the  appeal  for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  the  agency  shall 
promptly  notify  the  individual  in  writing  of  the  right  to  contact  an  EEO 
Counselor within forty-five  (45)  days of receipt of  this  notice and  to file 
an EEO complaint, subject to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.107.  The complaint will 
be processed as a non-mixed case.  See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(b). 

c. 

d. 

A  complainant  in  a  case  that  becomes  an  “unmixed”  complaint  after 
completion of the agency=s investigation and subject to the notice set forth 
at  29  C.F.R.§  1614.108(f)  need  not  be  referred  back  to  EEO  counseling 
and the 29 C.F.R.§ 1614.108(f) notice should be issued. 

When a mixed case complaint is “unmixed” by a finding by the MSPB of 
no jurisdiction, the individual has a right to elect between a hearing before 
a Commission Administrative Judge or an immediate final decision.  See 
29 C.F.R. § 1614.302(b). 

C. 

Age Discrimination in Employment Act Complaints 

When a  person contacts  an EEO Counselor with a  complaint of  age discrimination, the 
EEO Counselor must make the person aware of two important options: 

1. 

2. 

The person may choose to file a formal complaint under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614; or 

The person may bypass the administrative complaint process in Part 1614 and file 
a  civil  action  directly  in  an  appropriate  U.S.  District  Court  after  first  giving  the 
Commission  not  less  than  thirty  (30)  days  notice  of  intent  to  file  such  action.   
Such  notice  must  be  filed  within  180  days  after  the  date  of  the  alleged 
discrimination.  The notice may be mailed to the Commission Headquarters at the 
following address:

D.

1.   When a person contacts an EEO Counselor with  a complaint of wage-based sex 
discrimination, the EEO Counselor should advise the person that s/he may file a 
civil action in a U.S. District Court within two years, or three years if the violation 
is  willful,  of  the  date  of  the  alleged  violation,  regardless  of  whether  s/he  has 
pursued an administrative action against the agency.  The EEO Counselor further 
should  advise  the  person  that  the  filing  of  an  EEO  complaint  under  Part  1614 
alleging a violation of the EPA does not toll the time for filing a civil action. 

2.  

3.  

The EEO Counselor further should advise the person that if s/he seeks to allege a 
violation of Title VII=s prohibition against sex discrimination based on the same 
allegation,  s/he  must  raise  the  Title  VII  allegation  in  the  administrative  process 
even if s/he files a civil action on the EPA allegation. 

The  EEO  Counselor  also  should  advise  the  person  that  notwithstanding  the 
two/three-year limitations period applicable to the current action under the EPA, 
in  order  to  present  an  administrative  EPA  claim,  the  aggrieved  person  must 
contact  an  EEO  Counselor  within  forty-five  (45)  days  of  the  date  the  aggrieved 
person becomes aware of or reasonably suspects a violation of the EPA.

Discrimination Based on Marital Status, Political Affiliation, Status as a Parent 

1.  

Laws Enforced By the Commission -  

Discrimination  based  on  an  individual's  status  as  a  parent  (prohibited  under 
Executive  Order  13152)  is  not  a  covered  basis  under  the  laws  enforced  by  the 
Commission.    However,  there  are  circumstances  where  discrimination  against 
caregivers  may  give  rise  to  sex  discrimination  under  Title  VII  or  disability 
discrimination under the ADA.  See Enforcement Guidance: Unlawful Disparate 
Treatment of Workers with Caregiving Responsibilities. 

Federal  government  employees  may  file  claims  of  discrimination  under  the  Part 
1614  EEO  process  on  any  of  the  bases  covered  under  the  laws  the  Commission 
enforces,  and/or  may  also  utilize  additional  complaint  procedures  provided  by 
their agency or described below. 

2. 

Civil Service  Reform Act - The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978  (CSRA), as 
amended,  also  protects  federal  government  applicants  and  employees  from 
discrimination  in  personnel  actions  (see  “Prohibited  Personnel  Practices”)  based 
on  race,  color,  sex,  religion,  national  origin,  age,  disability,  marital  status, 
political  affiliation,  or  on  conduct  which  does  not  adversely  affect  the 
performance of the applicant or employee -- which can include sexual orientation 
or transgender (gender identity) status.  The Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and 
the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  (MSPB),  enforce  the  prohibitions  against 
federal employment discrimination codified in the CSRA.  For more information, 
see Addressing Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Discrimination in Federal 
Civilian  Employment  and  OPM’s  Guidance  Regarding  the  Employment  of 
Transgender  Individuals  in  the  Federal  Workplace  and  OSC’s  Prohibited 
Personnel Practices and How to File a Complaint. 

3. 

Executive Orders - Additionally, federal agencies retain procedures for making 
complaints of discrimination on any bases prohibited by Executive Orders.   

For Example, 

Executive  Order  13152  states  that  “status  as  a  parent”  refers  to  the  status  of  an 
individual who, with respect to an individual who is under the age of 18 or who is 
18 or older but is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability, 
is:  a  biological  parent,  an  adoptive  parent,  a  foster  parent,  a  stepparent,  a 
custodian  of  a  legal  ward,  in  loco  parentis  over  such  individual,  or  actively 
seeking  legal  custody  or  adoption  of  such  an  individual.    The  Executive  Order 
authorized OPM to develop guidance on the provisions of the Order.

APPENDIX E EEO-MD-110 
(SAMPLE) 
NOTICE OF POSSIBLE APPLICABILITY OF 
5 U.S.C. § 7121(D) TO ALLEGED DISCRIMINATORY ACTION 
(29 C.F.R. PART 1614) 

Section  1614.105  of  the  regulations  of  the  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission 
requires that upon an aggrieved person’s initial contact with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
(EEO)  Counselor,  or  as  soon  thereafter  as  possible,  the  EEO  Counselor  shall  inform  each 
aggrieved person of the possible applicability of 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d) to the alleged discriminatory 
action which  caused the  aggrieved person to seek EEO pre-complaint counseling.  Further, the 
EEO  Counselor  must  communicate  to  the  aggrieved  person  the  substance  of  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.301 concerning the election of remedies. 

Section 1614.301 (Relationship to Negotiated Grievance Procedure) provides as follows: 

(a)  When  a  person  is  employed  by  an  agency  subject  to  5  U.S.C.  §  7121(d)  and  is 
covered  by  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  that  permits  claims  of  discrimi-
nation to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, a person wishing to file a 
complaint or a grievance on a claim of alleged employment discrimination must 
elect  to  raise  the  claim  under  either  Part  1614  or  the  negotiated  grievance 
procedure, but not both.  An election to proceed under this part is indicated only 
by the filing of a written complaint; use of the pre-complaint process as described 
in  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.105  does  not  constitute  an  election  for  purposes  of  this 
section.    An  aggrieved  employee  who  files  a  complaint  under  this  part  may  not 
thereafter  file  a  grievance  on  the  same  claim.    An  election  to  proceed  under  a 
negotiated  grievance  procedure  is  indicated  by  the  filing  of  a  timely  written 
grievance.  An aggrieved employee who files a grievance with an agency whose 
negotiated  agreement  permits  the  acceptance  of  grievances  which  allege 
discrimination may  not thereafter  file  a complaint on the same claim under Part 
1614 regardless of whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to 
elect or of whether the grievance has raised an issue of discrimination.  Any such 
complaint  filed  after  a  grievance  has  been  filed  on  the  same  claim  shall  be 
dismissed  without  prejudice  to  the  complainant’s  right  to  proceed  through  the 
negotiated grievance procedure, including the right to appeal to the Commission 
from  a  final  decision  as  provided  in  subpart  D  of  this  part.    The  notice  of  final 
action dismissing such a complaint shall advise the complainant of the obligation 
to raise discrimination in the grievance process and of the right to appeal the final 
grievance decision to the Commission. 

(b)  When a person is not covered by a collective bargaining  agreement that permits 
claims of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, claims 
of discrimination shall be processed as complaints under this part. 

(c)  When a person is employed by an agency not subject to 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d) and is 
covered  by  a  negotiated  grievance  procedure,  claims  of  discrimination  shall  be

App. E-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix E  EEO-MD-110

processed as complaints under this part, except that the time limits for processing 
the  complaint  contained  in  29  C.F.R.  § 1614.106  and  for  appeal  to  the 
Commission contained in § 1614.402 may be held in abeyance during processing 
of a grievance covering the same claim as the complaint if the agency notifies the 
complainant in writing that the complaint will be held in abeyance pursuant to this 
section. 

Accordingly,  if  you  are  alleging  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex, 
national origin, age, disability, genetic information and/or reprisal and if you wish to pursue the 
claim,  you  must  make  an  election  to  pursue  it  either  as  a  complaint  with  your  agency  under 
29 C.F.R. Part 1614 or in a negotiated grievance procedure, if the following conditions apply: 

1. 

2. 

You  are  an  employee  of  a  federal  agency  subject  to  the  provisions  of 
5 U.S.C. § 7121(d), and 

You  are  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  which  permits 
claims of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure. 

If those two conditions apply to you, then you must elect one or the other procedure but not both.  
An election is made as follows: 

1. 

2. 

By filing a grievance in writing (whether or not the grievance has raised a 
claim of discrimination), or 

By  filing  a  written  formal  EEO  complaint  with  your  agency  under  Part 
1614.    Use  of  the  pre-complaint  process  (counseling)  under  29 C.F.R. 
§ 1614.105 does not constitute an election. 

If you have further questions concerning the possible applicability of 5 U.S.C. § 7121(d) to you, 
you  should  immediately  contact  a  representative  of  the  employee  organization  which  has  a 
negotiated  agreement  with  your  agency  or  ask  the  EEO  Counselor  for  further  information  and 
assistance.

DISABILITY--REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

Accommodation: 

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

5) 

6) 

7) 

Does  complainant  have  a  physical  or  mental  impairment  (for  example,  deafness; 
blindness;  partially  or  completely  missing  limbs  or  mobility  impairments  requiring  the 
use of a wheel chair; intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation); autism; 
cerebral palsy; major depressive disorder; bipolar disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; 
obsessive compulsive disorder; schizophrenia; cancer; diabetes; epilepsy; HIV infection; 
multiple  sclerosis;  and muscular  dystrophy)  that  is  readily  observable  or  where  there  is 
medical documentation of the impairment? 

Does this impairment, when active and not taking into account any mitigating measures 
employed  by  the  complainant,  substantially  limit  complainant’s  ability  to  perform  a 
major life activity (for example, caring for one’s self, performing manual tasks, walking, 
seeing,  hearing,  speaking,  breathing,  learning,  and  working)  or  substantially  limits  a 
major bodily function?  If not readily observable then provide evidence on the activities 
affected,  how they are  affected,  and  the degree to  which  they  are affected  (can't do the 
activity at all, can only do the activity with assistive devices or equipment, can only do 
the  activity  for  a  limited  period  of  time,  etc.).    The  question  of  whether  an  individual 
meets  the  definition  of  disability  under  29  C.F.R.  §  1630.(c)(4)  should  not  demand 
extensive analysis. 

Does the agency know of the complainant’s disability? 

Is  the  complainant  otherwise  qualified  (that  is,  does  the  complainant,  with  or  without 
accommodation, meet the education, skills, and experience requirements of the job)? 

What are the essential functions, (for example, the outcomes that must be achieved by a 
person in that position, not the methods by which those outcomes are typically achieved) 
of the complainant’s job? 

Did  complainant  request  accommodation?    What  accommodation,  if  any,  did  the 
complainant suggest?   

What  action  did  the  agency  take  to  identify  possible  accommodation  or  attempt 
accommodation?  Did the agency make an individualized assessment of the complainant,

comparing his/her qualifications and limitations with the job requirements?  What actions 
did the agency take to consider the complainant=s suggested accommodations? 

8) 

If an accommodation has been identified, will this accommodation enable complainant to 
perform the essential functions of the job, that is, is it effective? 

9) 

Did the agency provide an accommodation? 

10) 

11) 

If the agency did not provide an accommodation, what reason has the agency given for its 
refusal? 

If the agency contends that a particular accommodation would impose an undue hardship 
on  its  operations,  are  these  reasons  sufficient  to  establish  an  undue  hardship  defense 
given: 

a) 

b) 

c) 

the  overall  size  of  the  agency’s  program  (the  number  of  employees, 
number and type of facilities and size of budget); 

the type of agency operation (composition and structure of work force); 

the nature and net cost of accommodation.

MODEL FOR ANALYSIS 
DISABILITY--DISPARATE TREATMENT 

PRIMA FACIE CASE -- Where Complainant Alleges Disparate Treatment 

1) 

2) 

Does  complainant  have  a  physical  or  mental  impairment  (for  example,  deafness; 
blindness;  partially  or  completely  missing  limbs  or  mobility  impairments  requiring  the 
use of a wheel chair; intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation); autism; 
cerebral palsy; major depressive disorder; bipolar disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; 
obsessive compulsive disorder; schizophrenia; cancer; diabetes; epilepsy; HIV infection; 
multiple  sclerosis;  and muscular  dystrophy)  that  is  readily  observable  or  where  there  is 
medical documentation of the impairment? 

Does this impairment, when active and not taking into account any mitigating measures 
employed by the complainant substantially limit complainant’s ability to perform a major 
life activity (for example, caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, 
hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working) or substantially limits a major bodily 
function?  If not readily observable then provide evidence on the activities affected, how 
they are affected, and the degree to which they are affected (can’t do the activity at all, 
can only do the activity with assistive devices or equipment, can only do the activity for a 
limited period of time, etc.).  The question of whether an individual meets the definition 
of disability under 29 C.F.R. § 1630.(c)(4) should not demand extensive analysis. 

3) 

Does complainant have  a record or history of a  substantially limiting impairment (from 
which complainant may have recovered in whole or in part)? 

OR 

4) 

5) 

Was complainant regarded as having such an impairment (whether or not the complainant 
has an impairment or a substantially limiting impairment)? 

Does the agency know of complainant’s disability? 

Is  complainant  qualified  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  job  with  or  without 
reasonable accommodation: 

a. 

Is complainant otherwise qualified (that is, does the complainant, with or without 
accommodation, meet the educational and experience requirements of the job)?

Appendix J  EEO-MD-110

b. 

c. 

What  are  the  essential  functions,  (for  example,  the  outcomes  that  must  be 
achieved by a person in that position, not the methods by which those outcomes 
are typically achieved) of complainant’s job? 

Can  complainant  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  job  with  or  without 
accommodation?    If  an  accommodation  is  necessary,  see  Model  for  Analysis  -- 
Disability -- Reasonable Accommodation, Attachment J-5. 

6) 

Was  complainant  treated  differently  from  similarly  situated  employees  who  were  not 
disabled or who had different disabilities?  

a. 

b. 

Were compared employees in the same chain of command? 

Were compared employees in the same work unit? 

OR 

Is there direct evidence which shows discriminatory intent? 

REBUTTAL 

What did the agency say was the reason for treating complainant differently than other similarly-
situated employees who were not disabled or who had different disabilities? 

PRETEXT 

Is  there  direct  or  circumstantial  evidence  that  the  agency’s  reason  for  its  treatment  of 
complainant is pretextual?

MODEL FOR ANALYSIS 
RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION 

PRIMA FACIE CASE 

1) 

2) 

3) 

Does complainant hold a religious belief which conflicts with employment requirements?  
(Note:  only  in  the  rarest  of  cases,  where  the  evidence  appears  very  clear  that  the 
complainant does not sincerely hold the religious  belief or does not sincerely engage in 
the religious practices that may need an accommodation should an investigator challenge 
the sincerity of the belief or practice.) 

Has complainant informed his/her superior of a conflict? 

Has complainant been penalized for failing to comply with employment requirements? 

REBUTTAL 

1) 

2) 

Belief or practice not of religious nature.  

Agency could not accommodate without undue hardship. 

DUTY TO ACCOMMODATE -- RELIGIOUS COMPENSATORY TIME 

To allow employees to work additional hours (overtime, compensatory time) to make up for the 
time  required  by  their  personal  religious  belief  (Pub.  L.  No.  95-390,  5  U.S.C.  §  5550a, 
“Compensatory Time Off for Religious Observances”).

NOTICE OF INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION 
(SAMPLE) 

Subject: 

Notice of Incomplete Investigation 

FROM: 

[EEO Director] 

DATE: [Insert] 

TO: 

[Complainant/Complainant’s Representative] 

This  Notice  is  to  inform  you  that  the  investigation  of  [Agency  Complaint  No(s)]  has  not  been 
completed within the 180-day time frame.  Therefore, at this time, you have the right to request a 
hearing before a Commission Administrative Judge or to file a civil action in an appropriate U.S. 
District Court.  You should send your request for a hearing before a Commission Administrative 
Judge to [insert correct address for the Commission District Office].  If you choose to file a civil 
action, that action should be styled [Complainant v. Agency Head].  You may also petition the 
U.S.  District  Court  to  appoint  an  attorney  and  to  authorize  commencement  of  the  civil  action 
without payment of fees, costs, or security.  Whether your request is granted or denied is within 
the sole discretion of the U. S. District Judge. 

Should  you  elect  to  request  a  hearing  or  file  a  civil  action,  you  may  have  the  opportunity  to 
engage in discovery.  Discovery is a pre-hearing and pre-trial device you can use to obtain facts 
and information from the agency.  Tools of discovery include, but are not limited to, depositions, 
interrogatories,  requests  for  production  of  documents,  and  requests  for  admissions.    You  are 
required  to  prove  your  case  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  which  means  the  evidence  of 
discrimination must be of greater weight than the evidence of non-discrimination. 

In  the  alternative,  you  may  wait  until  the  investigation  is  complete,  at  which  time,  you  will 
receive notice of the right to request a hearing before a Commission Administrative Judge or to 
request  an  immediate  final  agency  decision.    The  estimated  date  of  completion  for  the 
investigation  is  [insert  date].    If  you  choose  to  wait  for  the  investigation  to  be  completed,  you 
need not take any action at this time.  The issuance of this Notice does not operate to waive your 
right  to  seek  sanctions  against  the  Agency  for  failing  to  complete  the  investigation  within  the 
required regulatory time frame.

all agency submissions – whether for a hearing as directed from an EEOC Administrative Judge, 
or  on  appeal  pursuant  to  29  C.F.R.  §  1614.403(g)  –  be  in  searchable  PDF  format.    Searchable

terms in the PDF document, and to copy and paste verbatim language from the PDF document 
into a word processing document.   

Saving  or  converting  word  processing  documents  to  PDF  automatically  results  in  a  searchable 
PDF document.  For those documents that are scanned, typically there is a setting on the scanner 
that changes the output to searchable PDF.  An image-only PDF document can also be converted 
to searchable PDF.  See http://blogs.adobe.com/acrobat/acrobat_ocr_make_your_scanned/.  

Digital  bookmarks  –  Digital  submissions  comprised  of  multiple  documents  (for  example, 
Reports  of  Investigation,  Administrative  Complaint  Files,  briefs/motions  containing  exhibits, 
etc.)  must  contain  hyperlinked  bookmarks  for  relevant/important  documents  therein.    The 
bookmarks must be named in a manner that describes what the document is (for example, “EEO 
Counselor’s  Report,”  “Formal  Complaint,”  “Exhibit  A  –  2014  Performance  Evaluation,”  etc.), 
rather than a generic tab or table of contents designation.  While more detailed bookmarking is 
always appreciated, the following documents (if applicable) must be bookmarked:

Consolidated  Submissions  on  Appeal  –  Submissions  on  appeal  to  the  Office  of  Federal 
Operations  should  be  consolidated  into  as  few  PDF  files  as  possible,  mindful  of  the  size 
restrictions imposed by the Commission’s document submission portal.  If a file exceeds the size 
limitation, it may be divided into multiple files, but there should be as few as possible.
