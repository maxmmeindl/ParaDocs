QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY,
PLACE OF WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS
UNLAWFUL
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees
on the basis of their sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an
unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any
individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual’s race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S.
768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as
well as belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections
also extend nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death.
See EEOC, Questions and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title
VII’s protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation
because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that
include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong
which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.’ Although courts generally
resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not
protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns ‘ultimate ideas’
about ‘life, purpose, and death’”).

As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical,
consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd.
of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S.
707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized
religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s sincerely held religious beliefs, it
is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989)
(“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a specific
tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely
held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held
religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.”
(emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. Supp.
2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,”
“not just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law provides protection for sincerely held
religious beliefs even when some members of the same religious organization, sect, or denomination
disagree with the beliefs espoused by the individual. That some individuals may have sincerely held
religious beliefs which differ from those sincerely held by the employees requesting accommodation
is irrelevant to whether the employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to protection
under Title VII.

 
Department of Health, in its handout literature for those considering one of the COVID-19 vaccines,
notes the following: “The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson did
require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the
vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 2021), 
https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana
Department of Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the
PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.”
La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21,
2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-
19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna
and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of Health’s publications again
confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of the development
of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology,
fetal cells were used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and
produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D.
Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are
developed and produced from, tested with, researched on, or otherwise connected with the aborted
fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs compel them to
abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their bodies, regardless of the
perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and other adherents
whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the three
currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any
employee is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many
indisputably do. Many employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the
womb and knows them prior to their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment
of conception to natural death. See Psalm 139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you
knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”);
Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one
of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.”); Isaiah 44:2
(“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus says the
Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah
49:5 (“And now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5
(“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I
appointed you a prophet to the nations”).

As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical,
consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd.
of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.
City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence
to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t

 
 
Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination,
especially one with a specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the

The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the Currently Available COVID-19
Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this section, the Secretary
(of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into interstate
commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec
t2i6o nofa 6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA
Statute]. As an essential part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates
that all individuals to whom the EUA product may be administered be given the option to accept or
refuse administration of the product. See 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that
“individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . of the option to accept or refuse
administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available COVID-19 vaccines
(Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use under the
EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact
Sheets for each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to
accept or receive the vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24,
2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive
the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard
medical care.” (emphasis added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June
25, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to
receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change
your standard medical care.” (emphasis added)); Janssen, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers
(July 8, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to
receive the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your
standard medical care.” (emphasis added)).

I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the
currently available alleged
COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His
Commandments, for which I would be held
morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a religious
accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s),
that will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse
employment action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs.
