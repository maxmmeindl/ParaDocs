Notes on Violations, Evidence, and Quotes 

•  Rehabilitation Act §501 (29 C.F.R. §1630): FEMA violated accommodation obligations by imposing restrictive 

requirements, failing to engage interactively, denying RAs without justification, and terminating Meindl without 

accommodations. 

•  MD-110 Violations: Include procedural disarray (§III.A), documentation errors (§IV.A), lack of interactive 

process (§VI.A), redundant documentation demands (§VI.C), and ignored retaliation indicators (§XI). 

 
•  FEMA Instruction 256-022-01 and Manual 1430.1: Delays (e.g., 196 days for RAR001234, 1,275 days for 

RAR0023278, 995 days for RAR0042452) violate 15–45-day timelines. 

•  FEMA Directive 123-0-2-1: Failure to initiate or conduct welfare checks post-Hurricane Beryl (Jul 8–31, 2024) 

neglected Meindl’s welfare. 

•  ADEA (29 U.S.C. §623): Delays, denials, and neglect disproportionately impacted Meindl, suggesting age 

discrimination (Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228). 

•  HIPAA (45 CFR §164.312): Unencrypted emails (Jul 10, 2024) breached Meindl’s PHI. 

•  EEOC Guidance (29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o)): Failure to consider virtual deployment as a reasonable accommodation 

in 2024 denials. 

•  29 C.F.R. §1614.105: EEO process timelines guide counseling and complaint filing. 

•  Evidence Sources: "MEINDL-FEMA Informal Intake Form-09-03-24-PRINT.pdf" confirms basis and contact 

details; additional text provides RA delays and denial details; other sources corroborate timelines. 

•  Quotes: Direct quotes enhance credibility; paraphrased for brevity where necessary. 

Recommendations for EEO Investigator 

1.  Verify Dates and Delays: 

o  Confirm RA delays (e.g., 995 days for RAR0042452, 1,275 days for RAR0023278) and EEO process 

timeline (Sep 3, 2024–Jan 7, 2025) via FEMA logs. 

o  Validate Aug 5, Aug 15, and Aug 16, 2024, denial details using "MEINDL-FEMA Informal Intake Form-

09-03-24-PRINT.pdf" and additional text. 

2.  Examine RA Processing: 

o 

Investigate blank form issue (Aug 23, 2018), documentation rejections (Aug 4, 2022; Jul 11, 2024), and 

denial justifications (Aug 2024) for MD-110 §VI.C, Rehabilitation Act, and EEOC Guidance violations. 

3.  Interview Key Individuals: 

o  Anna Myers, Jodi Hunter, Anthony In: Clarify denial rationales and lack of interactive process for 

RAR0046767. 

o  Tara, Janet Kelley: Verify EEO counseling process and ADR failure. 

o  Sandra Maddox Britt, Luz Fernandez, Nicole Oke, Jamie McAllister, Detra Terry: Address 2018–

2019 RA delays and denial. 

o  Miriam Aybar-Morales, Karina Aguilo, Traci Brasher, Shelia Clemons, Donald J. Simko: 

Investigate later RA denials and affidavit misrepresentations. 

4.  FOIA Request: 

o  Verify RA denial rate for employees aged 60+ to support ADEA claims. 

5.  Assess Retaliation: 

o 

Investigate termination (Jan 6, 2025) for retaliation linked to EEO activity (MD-110 §XI, 29 C.F.R. 

§1614.101). 

6.  Check Welfare and HIPAA Compliance: 

o  Review FEMA’s failure to initiate call-down post-Hurricane Beryl (Jul 8–31, 2024) for FEMA Directive 

123-0-2-1 violations. 

o  Examine unencrypted emails (Jul 10, 2024) for PHI breaches.

claim? 4. Why did your affidavit (Apr 
14, 2025) misrepresent Meindl’s RA 
engagement and deny termination 
accountability? 5. How did you assess 
virtual deployment feasibility per 
EEOC Guidance (29 C.F.R. 
§1630.2(o))? 
1. Why did you claim Meindl “cannot 
leave his house” when he deployed 
virtually for 38 months and agreed to 
Houston deployment? 2. Why was 
virtual deployment not considered, 
given Meindl’s success and EEOC 
Guidance (29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o))? 3. 
Why did your denial lack specific 
reasons (e.g., undue hardship) per 
FEMA Instruction 256-022-01? 4. 
Why did your affidavit (Apr 14, 2025) 
deny RA history knowledge, given 
your supervisory role? 5. Did you 
review Meindl’s onboarding to confirm

(overruled deployment). 

Probe affidavit 
misrepresentations, 
reassignment failures, and 
ADR inaction, assess 
bias. 

50-week deployment was specified, as 
claimed? 
1. Why did you deny RAR0046767 
without assessing virtual deployment, 
given Meindl’s 38-month success? 2. 
Who overruled the Houston 
deployment on May 29, 2024, and why 
was Meindl’s willingness dismissed? 3. 
Why was the denial (Aug 5, 2024) not 
supported by specific reasons per 
FEMA Instruction 256-022-01? 4. 
Did you discuss Meindl’s 
underutilization concerns, and why 
were no alternative accommodations 
explored? 5. How did you ensure 
Rehabilitation Act §501 compliance 
in the final denial (Dec 2, 2024)? 
1. What was your role in the Oct 17, 
2024, ADR mediation, and why did it 
fail due to FEMA resistance? 2. Why 
did your affidavit (Apr 14, 2025) claim 
Meindl refused deployment, despite his 
May 29, 2024, agreement? 3. Why 
were no virtual roles explored during 
the reassignment search (Oct 30, 
2024)? 4. Did you review Meindl’s RA 
history or 38-month virtual work before 
making affidavit claims? 5. How did 
you ensure Rehabilitation Act §501 
compliance in the reassignment 
process? 

Additional Recommendations 

•  Document Requests: Request additional records (e.g., FEMA Form 256-02 for RAR0046767 denial, job 

interview transcript) to verify claims (e.g., 50-week deployment requirement). 

•  FOIA: Pursue the RA denial rate for employees aged 60+ in FEMA Region 6.
