Hello DU,

This is the 2nd email traffic which indicates what has been put in place by the Supervisor of
Record.  Please see below.  Employee and Supervisor has indicated all documents including
medical has been uploaded to ACMS. The ACMS Tracking Number is noted in the Subject Line.
Again, the employee/SOR raised concerns about the follow up from the DU.  Please let the
Employee/Supervisor know if there is any additional information needed  from either the
Employee/Supervisor or Healthcare provider to support the request.

Please confirm when RAR0042452 is closed.

Thank you sincerely,
