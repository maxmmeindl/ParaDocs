Foreword 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to achieve business and 
management excellence by providing guidance and policy direction for the 
administration of FEMA’s Cadre of On-call Response/Recovery Employees (COREs). 
FEMA’s most valuable resource is its workforce; permanent and temporary employees 
who are focused on and committed to leading America to prepare for, prevent, respond 
to, and recover from all-hazards incidents. FEMA relies upon its temporary personnel, in 
particular, to carry out its role in incident management and support operations and to 
augment FEMA’s permanent workforce.   

The objective of the CORE Program is to attract and maintain a pool of highly skilled 
and motivated temporary personnel who are well trained and ready to respond and 
deliver quality and timely services to survivors and communities impacted by all-hazards 
incidents. The publication of this Manual will ensure consistent policy application and 
enable FEMA to better manage COREs in a cost effective and efficient manner, while 
offering the necessary incentives to recruit a professional incident workforce capable of 
assisting disaster survivors in their time of greatest need.

1-5.  Policy 

A.  The authority provided by the Stafford Act allows FEMA to manage its CORE 
Program without being required to apply all of the provisions of Title 5, United 
States Code, and its implementing regulations. FEMA chooses, as a matter of 
policy, to administratively implement some Title 5 provisions and, in other 
circumstances, to use its Stafford Act authority to create and administer its 
own policies to more effectively manage Stafford Act employees consistent 
with the intent and program needs for these positions. In all circumstances, 
FEMA intends to develop and implement policies that are fair and equitable to 
its CORE workforce and that are consistently understood and implemented by 
FEMA managers and supervisors. 

B.  COREs are hired to directly support the response and recovery efforts related 

to disasters and are funded out of the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). As 
temporary employees, COREs cannot replace the work performed and 
funded through annual appropriations by permanent full-time staff. COREs 
can perform Stafford Act duties that are not otherwise funded in FEMA’s 
budget and can be charged to an open disaster. The use of COREs must be 
reviewed and validated on a recurring basis to ensure a continued need for 
the positions and consistent funding decisions across FEMA. 

C.  FEMA shall: 

1.  Staff positions with the best qualified persons available; 

2.  Develop and use COREs to the maximum extent possible consistent with 

the completion of FEMA’s mission and the Stafford Act; 

3.  Establish CORE positions with a minimum of two-year appointments 
(unless otherwise justified for less than two years based on workload 
analyses) based on requests from Offices and Directorates authorized to 
fill CORE positions. Offices and Directorates will request the renewal of a 
CORE’s appointment prior to the CORE’s expiration date, subject to 
funding (see section 3-9); 

4.  Require COREs to sign a Conditions of Employment letter at the time of 

hiring and reappointment; 

5.  Ensure that all personnel actions are taken without regard to political, 

religious, or labor organization affiliation or non-affiliation, marital or family 
status, race, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, 
genetic information, age, or prior Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
activity; without regard to criteria unrelated to the position, such as 
personal friendship or patronage, and that selections are based solely on 
job-related criteria; and do not fall within prohibited personnel practices 
identified at 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b);  

9 

 
 
6.  Establish a pay system that will improve the ability of FEMA to attract and 

retain quality candidates and employees; 

7.  Ensure that equal pay is provided for work of equal value, with appropriate 
consideration of both national and local pay rates paid by employers in the 
private sector, and that appropriate incentives and recognition should be 
provided for excellence in performance; and 

8.  Provide effective education and training, consistent with Stafford Act 
duties, which will result in enhanced organizational and individual 
performance. 

D.  COREs must: 

1.  Maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public 

interest; and 

2.  Be prepared at all times to deploy or work from alternate work locations 

other than their normal official duty station. 

E.  COREs may be terminated at any time, with cause (poor performance or 

misconduct), or without cause (such as when workload or funding diminishes 
or ends). 

F.  A CORE may be subject to removal if the CORE declines a deployment 

request without reasonable cause. 

1-6.  Definitions 

A.  Algorithm. A formula for allocating a CORE’s salary and benefits across 

multiple disaster declarations. The allocation should correlate to the estimated 
amount of time the CORE performs work attributable to each declaration. 

B.  Annual Direct Charge CORE Certification. The annual process for verification 
of Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) related duties and the continued need for all 
CORE positions.   

C.  Appointment. A personnel action that results in an individual becoming a 
FEMA employee. Individuals, who accept CORE positions, are given 
excepted service appointments with FEMA under the Stafford Act. Generally, 
appointments may not be effective prior to the date of approval by the 
appointing official and are only effective from the date of acceptance of the 
offer of employment and entrance on duty, unless a later date is stated on the 
SF-52, or other approving document. 

D.  Ancillary Support. Personnel directly supporting disaster operations from their 

daily duty station. 

E.  Backfill. Hiring an employee to fill a previously approved vacant funded 

position. 

F.  Basic pay. The rate of pay fixed by administrative action for the position held 
before any deductions, but exclusive of additional pay of any other kind, 
including premium pay. 

10 

 
 
G.  Career path. A progression of positions in one or more occupational series 

leading to an increase in responsibility and proficiency. 

H.  Confidential Financial Disclosure (OGE Form 450) Filer. A CORE who, 

because of the duties of his or her assigned position, must file confidential 
financial disclosure reports (OGE Form 450s) as directed by the Office of 
Government Ethics and FEMA’s Office of the Chief Counsel pursuant to 5 
C.F.R. § 2634 Subpart I. COREs in these positions are assigned FEMA 
duties that involve the exercise of significant discretion in certain sensitive 
areas. OGE Form 450 disclosures serve to ensure confidence in the integrity 
of FEMA operations by identifying and preventing potential conflicts of 
interest. If a CORE’s position description indicates duties requiring a 
confidential financial disclosure, timely filing of OGE Form 450 is a condition 
of employment. 

I.  Continuing Service Agreement (CSA). A written agreement between FEMA 

and a CORE under which the CORE agrees to a specified period of 
employment with FEMA in return for a monetary incentive or participation in a 
training or developmental program. 

J.  Conversion Action. The process by which a non-CORE FEMA employee is 

appointed to a CORE position.  

K.  CORE-I (IMAT CORE). A CORE assigned full-time to an IMAT and to an 

IMAT position description. CORE-Is receive four-year appointments and are 
the first FEMA personnel deployed to an incident, serving in leadership roles 
as part of an IMAT. When not deployed, IMAT CORE base salaries are paid 
from the Disaster Readiness and Support (DRS) account; however, when 
deployed their salaries are paid by the disaster (under the declaration). IMAT 
COREs are non-direct charge COREs and new, backfill, or reassignment 
actions are not subject to direct charge CORE requirements. 

L.  Declaration. Declarations for DRF-funded events, including major disasters, 

emergencies, fire management declarations, and disasters under the 
Compact of Free Association. 

M.  Demotion. A change to a lower grade or pay band and a decrease in pay as a 

result of an adverse action or poor performance.  

N.  Direct Charge CORE. Employees whose primary duty is to carry out Stafford 

Act functions in support of open, active declarations or pre-event surge 
activities to an event for which a declaration is reasonably likely and 
imminent. The salary of a Direct Charge CORE is charged to Major Disasters, 
Emergencies, Fire Management Assistance Grants or the Disaster Surge 
account. Direct Charge COREs working on specific events should charge 
their time directly to those events. Direct Charge COREs working on multiple 
events or working as a part of a distributed group defined below should 
charge their time to an algorithm that accurately reflects the amount of work 
performed for each of those events. Specifically, the salary of a Direct Charge 
CORE may be structured in one of the following ways: 

11 

 
1.  Specific Declaration: Salary is based on work performed on a single, 

specific declaration.  

2.  Multiple Declarations: Salary is based on work that provides services to 
multiple declarations and is charged based on an established algorithm.  

3.  Distributed Group Activities: Activities comprised of non-segregable 

declaration and non-declaration related functions that will be performed 
collectively by COREs and non-COREs. The number of COREs carrying 
out a particular Distributed Group Activity is based on the percentage of 
time required for the disaster related functions of that Distributed Group 
Activity. Charges are allocated across multiple disasters based on an 
established algorithm for the Distributed Group Activity.1  

Duties related to preparedness, readiness, and planning for future events are 
not allowable Direct Charge CORE duties. Charging a CORE’s salary to 
declarations when the duties performed by the CORE do not support those 
declarations could result in a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) and 
result in adverse actions against the responsible officials. 

O.  Distributed Group Activity Baseline. The ratio of COREs and non-COREs 
carrying out a particular Distributed Group Activity as determined by the 
percentage declaration and non-declaration functions performed for that 
Activity based on verifiable workload data and evaluation of current or past 
budget justification materials. 

P.  FEMA Qualification System (FQS). A performance-based system for 

certifying FEMA employees as “Qualified” or “Trainee” in IM and IS positions; 
certification is based on successful completion of required experience, 
required training, and demonstrated performance (see FEMA Directive 010-9, 
Incident Workforce Cadre Management, dated June 9, 2014). 

Q.  Fitness Determination. “Fitness” means “the level of character and conduct 
determined for an individual to perform work for or on behalf of a Federal 
agency as an employee in the excepted service (other than a position subject 
to suitability) or as a contractor employee.” Executive Order 13,488, § 2(d); 
implemented in DHS Instruction 121-01-007, Chapter 3. 

R.  IM CORE. A CORE assigned to a two-year appointment and whose primary 
job duty is to perform an FQS incident management position. When not 
deployed, IM CORE base salaries are paid from the Disaster Readiness and 
Support (DRS) account; however, when deployed their salaries are paid by 
the disaster (under the declaration). IM COREs are non-direct charge COREs 

1 For example, OCFO’s FEMA Finance Center has a Distributed Group Activity that processes and pays invoices 
related to both disaster and non-disaster activities. Determining the number of CORE positions that should populate 
this Distributed Group Activity requires an analysis of the ratio of disaster functions versus non-disaster functions. If 
the analysis concludes that 70% of the functions are disaster related and the entire Distributed Group Activity 
requires 10 positions, then the analysis would justify 7 CORE positions out of the 10 needed to perform those 
functions. 

12 

 
                                                           
and new, backfill, or reassignment actions are not subject to direct charge 
CORE requirements 

S.  Incident Management (IM). The incident-level operation of the Federal role in 
emergency response, recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities 
include the direct control and employment of resources, management of 
incident offices, operations, and delivery of Federal assistance through all 
phases of response and recovery. 

T.  Incident Support (IS). The coordination of all Federal resources that support 
emergency response, recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities 
include the deployment of national-level assets, support of national objectives 
and programs affected during the disaster, and support of incident operations 
with resources, expertise, information, and guidance. 

U.  Locality Payment. A locality-based comparability payment (see 5 U.S.C. § 

5304 and 5 C.F.R. Part 531, subpart F). 

V.  Mission Essential. Personnel who perform a limited set of FEMA functions 
that must be continued throughout, or resumed rapidly after, a disruption of 
normal activities. 

W. Non-Direct Charge CORE. COREs whose salaries are partially or wholly 
funded by the DRS account within the DRF. These employees’ functions 
support operational readiness, response, and recovery functions of the 
Stafford Act that are not directly attributable to the response and recovery 
efforts of any specific declaration or pre-event surge activities to an event for 
which a declaration is reasonably likely and imminent. Examples of Non-
Direct Charge COREs include IM and IMAT COREs when not deployed or 
working for an open disaster.  

X.  Offices and Directorates. Office of the Administrator, Office of Chief Counsel, 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of External Affairs, Office of Policy 
and Program Analysis, Office of Response and Recovery, Response 
Directorate, Recovery Directorate, Logistics Management Directorate, 
Protection and National Preparedness, National Preparedness Directorate, 
National Continuity Programs Directorate, Grant Programs Directorate, 
Mission Support, Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, Office of the Chief 
Component Human Capital Officer, Office of the Chief Information Officer, 
Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, Office of the Chief Security Officer, 
Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, FIA Mitigation, FIA 
Insurance, United States Fire Administration, and Offices of Regional 
Administrators. 

Y.  Pay Adjustment. Any increase or decrease in a CORE’s basic pay when there 
is no change in the duties or responsibilities of the CORE’s position within the 
same career path and pay plan (see sections 5-3 and 6-3). 

Z.  Pay Band. A range of pay for a group or categories of employees that FEMA 

established according to FEMA’s Stafford Act authority. 

13 

 
AA. Permanent Full-Time (PFT). A permanent FEMA employees who meets the 

definition of “employee” under 5 U.S.C. § 2105. 

BB. Post-Action Review. An internal control established to ensure compliance 

with the Annual Direct Charge CORE Certification review and documentation 
requirements established for Direct Charge CORE positions.   

CC.Program Area. A discrete subdivision within an Office, Division, Branch, or 

Unit that performs work that is substantially different from the work performed 
by other subdivisions. 

DD.Promotion. A personnel action that moves a CORE (1) to a higher grade; (2) 
from one pay band to a higher pay band in the same career path; or (3) to a 
position in another career path in combination with an increase in the CORE’s 
basic pay. 

EE. Qualifying Life Event (QLE). OPM designated events deemed acceptable to 
the IRS that may allow premium conversion participants to change their 
participation election for premium conversion outside of an open season. For 
more information, see OPM’s Healthcare Reference Materials for a listing of 
the authorized Qualifying Life Events. 

FF.Reassignment. A personnel action that moves a CORE from one position to 
another without promotion or change to a lower pay band, grade, or step, at 
management discretion and based on necessary approvals. Reassignment 
includes: (1) movement to a position in a new occupational series, or to 
another position in the same series; (2) assignment to a position that has 
been reclassified due to the introduction of a new or revised classification or 
job grading standard; (3) assignment to a position that has been reclassified 
as a result of a position review; and (4) movement to a different position at the 
same band but with a change in salary that is the result of a different locality 
payment.

CHAPTER 2:  RECRUITMENT AND HIRING 

2-1.  General 

A.  FEMA Offices and Directorates will identify the Selecting Official for each hire. 

B.  FEMA Offices and Directorates may elect to recruit and hire candidates via a 
vacancy announcement as specified in section 2-4, or via a name request 
pursuant to section 2-5. FEMA maintains the flexibility to use alternative hiring 
procedures not specified in this Chapter when necessary to meet its mission 
requirements. 

C.  Nepotism is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. § 3110 and is also a “prohibited personnel 
practice” under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(7). Under 5 U.S.C. § 3110, a public official 
is prohibited from appointing, employing, promoting, advancing, or advocating 
for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement of a relative in or to 
a civilian position in FEMA in which the public official is serving or over which 
the public official exercises jurisdiction or control of any individual who is a 
relative of the public official. Upon determining that a minimally qualified 
candidate is a relative or the relative of the Selecting Official, or of someone 
in the chain of command of the Selecting Official, the program office must 
refrain from taking action on the job vacancy and contact the servicing HR 
Specialist for guidance. Supervision of a relative is not generally considered 
to be “nepotism” but is prohibited as it presents an apparent conflict of 
interest. Supervision of employees with whom the supervisor has a “covered 
relationship” may also be an apparent conflict of interest (see 5 C.F.R. § 
2635.502). 

2-2.  Staffing Plans 

A.  Offices and Directorates authorized to fill CORE positions will conduct 
workload analyses every three years, or earlier if needed based on 
operational changes, to forecast and plan for future work and skills 
requirements based on historical data, technical estimates, directed 
requirements, and approved staffing models.  

1.  The workload analysis will first identify all activities performed by each 

position (e.g., PFT, CORE, and Reservist) within an Office or Directorate, 
and designate current and planned future activities.  

2.  The analysis will estimate how frequent the activity is performed, and the 
amount of time an employee will need to complete each of the identified 
activities for which a Distributed Group Activity Baseline has not been 
approved or is being modified. 

3.  The analysis may identify shortages or overages in current staffing needs, 
which will be documented and maintained by the Offices and Directorates 
until superseded by a subsequent workload analysis or other staffing 
initiative.  

25 

 
 
B.  Based on the workload analysis, Offices and Directorates requesting CORE 

positions will develop and submit staffing plans, subject to funding, to 
OCCHCO with the number of CORE positions by title, series, grade, and duty 
station.  

1.  OCCHCO will review the entity’s requested number of CORE positions 

and proposed length of appointment based on the workload analysis and 
staffing plan.  

2.  Upon OCCHCO’s review and approval of the staffing plan, OCCHCO will 
submit the plans to OCFO for approval if the plan includes a non-Direct 
Charge CORE, or a Distributed Group Activity Direct Charge CORE if the 
distributed group activity baseline has not been approved or has changed 
since the last approval. 

3.  Upon any needed confirmation from OCFO, OCCHCO will authorize an 

Office or Directorate to create or renew a set number of CORE Positions. 

4.  The Associate Administrator for Mission Support will review and resolve 
any disputes between an Office or Directorate and OCCHCO regarding 
the approval of a workload analysis or staffing plan.   

C.  Any request to add, move, rightsize, or adjust a CORE position (if rightsizing 
a position, see Chapter 12, Rightsizing) made between workload analysis 
cycles or that does not align with the current staffing plan must be submitted 
by the head of the Office or Directorate and will require a reexamination of the 
most recent workload analysis to determine whether the identified shortages 
or additional work exists to justify the requested position, its length, and pay 
band or grade. Upon OCCHCO’s review and approval of the staffing plan, 
OCCHCO will submit the plans to OCFO for approval if the plan includes a 
non-Direct Charge CORE, or a Distributed Group Activity Direct Charge 
CORE if the distributed group activity baseline has not been approved or has 
changed since the last approval. 

D.  Duty stations for COREs will be established by the supervisor of record in 

conjunction with OCCHCO. 

2-3.  Annual Direct Charge CORE Certification 

A.  An Annual Direct Charge CORE certification, validating and verifying the 

CORE’s performance of DRF related duties and the continued need for all 
CORE positions (which have not been requested or funded elsewhere in 
FEMA’s budget), is required by the Assistant Administrator, Associate 
Administrator, Regional Administrator, and any FEMA employee reporting 
directly to the Administrator. 

B.  CORE positions must be used to execute functions or activities funded solely 

by the DRF or DRS account and are not charged elsewhere in FEMA’s 
budget. COREs may be used to administer support to FEMA’s non-
permanent workforce hired under the Stafford Act, performing duties 
including, but not limited to, hiring and staffing, training and development, 

26 

 
 
personnel and payroll processing, legal support, developing and 
implementing disaster policies and decisions, supervising Stafford Act 
employees, maintaining information technology and telecommunications 
services for Stafford Act employees or events, financial management, 
property and facility management, and auditing and program oversight. 
OCFO and OCC will provide Directorates and Offices with supplemental 
guidance on the proper use of CORE positions as needed. 

C.  Offices and Directorates must also electronically maintain documentation 
supporting the creation, backfilling or reassignment of CORE positions. 
Offices and Directorates will maintain workload analyses, position 
justifications, and staffing plans. The electronic files2 are also subject to 
independent post-action compliance review by OCFO and/or OCCHCO.   

D.  Documentation requirements for “Direct Charge” COREs  

1. Comprehensive list of all COREs to include position title, area assigned, 

branch/office, duty station, grade, PIN, and CORE type.  

2. Algorithm(s), to include methodology and frequency of analysis, used to 

determine allocation of salary costs to open active disasters. 

3. A description of duties for each position or group of positions performing 
the same work that validates the relationship of work being performed to 
open, active disasters. Example: This Public Assistance (PA) Specialist 
will: (1) be responsible for the closeout of project worksheets, (2) deploy to 
disasters to support the development and obligation of PA projects, and (3) 
conduct eligibility review of public assistance projects.  

4. Baselines and supporting documentation for establishing the baselines for 

Distributed Activity Group “Direct-Charge” COREs.  

5. Documentation shall be maintained on OCFO’s SharePoint (see footnote 
2) and shall be made available to the OCFO and/or OCCHCO for review. 
Files must be maintained in accordance with the most current DHS records 
retention policy. 

2-4.  Procedures for Soliciting Candidates 

FEMA uses the procedures listed below to hire qualified candidates for CORE 
appointments unless a name request procedure is used (see section 2-5). 

A.  To advertise a CORE position, an Office or Directorate shall submit a 

Standard Form (SF-52) to OCCHCO with a position description. If desired, 
the Office or Directorate may also submit a draft vacancy announcement or 
instead, request that OCCHCO draft it. Additionally, the Office or Directorate 
may, but is not required to, submit a specialized experience statement and 
any assessment screen-out questions that should be included in the

extension is authorized by OCCHCO. 

29 

 
2-5.  Name Request 

A.  In lieu of utilizing the hiring procedures specified in section 2-4, Offices and 
Directorates may hire qualified candidates (eligible U.S. citizens, current 
Federal employees, or current FEMA COREs) via a name request to meet a 
hiring need or to promote a CORE to a grade outside of the CORE’s current 
position ladder. Such a promotion must include the same justification and 
approval established for name request hires (see Chapters 5 and 6 for more 
information on promotions). 

B.  The Office or Directorate must submit a justification that describes the 

individual’s qualifications with the SF-52 and resume. 

C.  Any name request must be approved in writing by the requesting 

organization’s Division Chief (or higher). 

D.  Name requests may be approved even if the Office or Directorate has not 

posted a vacancy announcement for the position or otherwise competed the 
position. 

E.  The HR Specialist will review the package to determine if the applicant meets 
the basic qualifications for the position and promptly notify the Selecting 
Official if the applicant is not minimally qualified. 

F.  Name request hiring actions must follow the interview, reference check, and 

job offer procedures outlined below. 

2-6. 

Interviews 

Interviews are conducted for candidates referred to the supervisor as a means of 
obtaining supplemental information on their qualifications. 

A.  At a minimum, the Selecting Official must interview the candidate selected for 
the position. The Selecting Official may designate one or more appropriate 
persons to conduct or participate in the interviews.  

B.  The Selecting Official should ask all candidates the same job-related 

questions and document the responses in writing. The Selecting Official 
should maintain such documentation for a minimum of two years. The 
Selecting Official should ask the same questions, in the same order, of all 
interviewed candidates. Follow-up questions to clarify information are 
permissible. It is preferable to conduct interviews in person and to use the 
same interview method for all applicants.  

C.  The Selecting Official should not ask questions regarding a candidate’s race, 
religion, sex, family status, national origin, religion, age, genetic background, 
health history, disability, political affiliation, or any other prohibited questions 
found in FEMA’s Interview and Selection Guidance, June 4, 2014.  

D.  The Selecting Official or his or her designee(s) may conduct a subsequent 

interview or contact one or more of the candidates for additional or clarifying 
information after completing and evaluating the initial interviews. The 

30 

 
 
 
supervisor should consult with the HR Specialist if a subsequent interview is 
deemed advisable to ensure that the reason for the subsequent interview is 
related to the requirements of the position. 

E.  Interview notes must be retained in accordance with section 2-10 and must 

not be destroyed. 

F.  In accordance with the Every Employee is an Emergency Manager (EE-EM) 
initiative,3 all employees conducting hiring interviews must explain and 
reiterate, using a set of standard questions and briefing points, the EE-EM 
vision that all COREs must be willing to receive incident support or incident 
management assignments. Additionally, all new COREs are required to sign 
an acknowledgment form confirming their understanding of the EE-EM policy. 
The supervisor must ensure that the EE-EM vision is explained in all initial 
interviews and that any candidate who is referred for hire or further 
examination has completed the applicable acknowledgment form. This form 
can be obtained from the serving HR Specialist. 

G.  All new COREs must acknowledge the requirement to work at a Directed 

Work Location, which may be the CORE’s Residence of Record or another 
alternate duty location, in the event of office closures, emergencies, or when 
otherwise directed. 

2-7.  Reference Checks 

The Selecting Official must check and document a candidate’s references before 
the candidate receives a job offer. Reference checking is a vital part of a 
successful hiring strategy and is primarily used to verify information provided by 
the candidate; better predict the candidate’s on-the-job success; and gain 
additional information about the candidate’s qualifications for the position. 
Selecting Officials may use FEMA Form 30-35, Telephone Reference Check, to 
satisfy the requirement to document reference checks. Selecting Officials should 
coordinate with OCCHCO prior to deciding not to hire a candidate because of a 
reference check. 

2-8.  Job Offers 

All offers of employment must be made by OCCHCO. The servicing HR 
Specialist must confirm qualifications and the proposed rate of pay for the 
candidate with the Selecting Official prior to extending an offer. Additionally, the 
HR Specialist will confirm acceptance of the offer and will consult with the 
Selecting Official in establishing an entrance on duty (EOD) date once the 
appropriate background check has been made by OCSO.

2-9.  Notification to Applicants 

OCCHCO Talent Acquisition Division will acknowledge receipt of all applications 
and notify all applicants if they have or have not been selected for the position. 

2-10.  Recordkeeping Requirements 

A.  Supervisors shall create, maintain, use and dispose of FEMA records in 

accordance with applicable law and FD 141-1, FEMA Records Management 
Program. 

B.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and in accordance with Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations, all personnel records made or 
kept by FEMA, including but not limited to, application forms submitted by 
applicants, name request justifications, interview notes, reference check 
documents, and other records having to do with hiring, shall be preserved for 
one year from the date of the making of the record or of the personnel action 
involved, whichever occurs later. 

C.  If applicable, when a non-selectee challenges the non-selection before an 

administrative or judicial body, OCCHCO and the supervisor must retain the 
aforementioned documentation until the final disposition of the charge or 
lawsuit. OCC will notify OCCHCO and the supervisor of any litigation holds 
and when documentation relating to a charge or lawsuit may be disposed of 
according to FEMA’s record retention policy.

3-2.  CORE Appointments 

A.  COREs are hired under a Stafford Act appointment authority and their 

salaries and benefits are funded by the DRF, thus the scope of their duties 
must predominately carryout Stafford Act activities.   

B.  Individuals appointed to CORE positions are given time-limited appointments 
for a period of not less than two years but not to exceed four years unless the 
appointment is renewed for another term. The length of the appointment 
requested by the Office or Directorate should be commensurate with the 
expected amount of work available for the CORE in question (the 
appointment can be less than two years if appropriate). 

C.  A CORE appointment does not confer eligibility or priority consideration for a 

permanent appointment. 

D.  A CORE’s work schedule may be changed and a CORE may be assigned a 
Mission Essential, Incident Management, Incident Support, or Ancillary

Support title, irrespective of his or her position description, based on the 
operational needs of FEMA. 

E.  COREs are not subject to any protection afforded by reduction-in-force 

provisions, re-employment rights, or adverse action procedures established 
under any statutory or regulatory provision. 

F.  COREs must be ready to deploy wherever FEMA needs their services and 

have 24 hours to respond to a deployment order and may be required to work 
long hours under stressful and unfavorable conditions. 

G.  A CORE’s appointment will end on the Not to Exceed (NTE) date of his or her 
appointment, unless it is extended or renewed based on the needs of FEMA. 

H.  COREs may be appointed to supervisory positions and serve as supervisors 
of record for other Stafford Act employees, provided that the CORE is hired 
into a position description classified as supervisory and completes mandatory 
supervisory training. COREs may serve as a temporary duty supervisor 
during a deployment, so long as the work supervised arises out of the 
Stafford Act and the period of supervision is temporary and/or short-term. 

I.  COREs, who serve as the supervisor of record for PFTs on the date when 

this Manual becomes effective, may continue to serve in such capacity until 
the CORE’s current term expires. 

3-3.  Conditions of Employment 

All CORE appointees are required to sign a Conditions of Employment statement 
upon appointment, and upon renewal of an appointment. COEs contain 
significant, but not all of, the DHS/FEMA and other rules and regulations that 
COREs must abide by, including but not limited to: 
A.  Complying with FEMA’s deployment procedures and policies;7 

B.  Using electronic funds transfer for salary payments and travel 

reimbursements; 

C.  Maintaining eligibility for a government issued travel charge card, and abiding 
by the terms and conditions established by the bank issuing the travel card

E.  Traveling in the most expeditious and cost effective manner, abiding by DHS  

and FEMA travel policy to make all travel arrangements; 

7 See FD 010-8, FEMA Incident Workforce Deployment, January 29, 2014. 

34 

 
 
                                                           
F.  If authorized to use a motor vehicle for official business, complying with all 
applicable laws, regulations, and policies related to official motor vehicle 
usage; 

G.  Abiding by the terms of use in all revocable licensing agreements with respect 
to all FEMA-issued property, and using FEMA-issued property for official 
purposes only; and 

H.  Complying with FEMA Manual 123-9-1, Telework, if their supervisor 

authorizes telework. 

Failure to comply with these conditions of employment, or any other standards of 
conduct, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal from 
Federal service (see Chapter 11). 

3-4.  Directed Work Location 

COREs will work at their Residence of Record or other designated locations by 
FEMA supervisors and managers, if so directed. COREs may be directed to work 
at alternate locations on days when their regular worksite is closed due, but not 
limited to, weather closures, localized emergencies, facility safety, or for 
operational needs. COREs working at a Directed Work Location are not 
teleworking. 

3-5.  Oath of Office 

A.  The following FEMA personnel are authorized to administer the oath of office 

to newly appointed COREs or to delegate this authority: 

1.  The Administrator; 

2.  Deputy Administrator; 

3.  Regional Administrators; 

4.  The Chief Component Human Capital Officer; 

5.  Federal Coordinating Officers; and 

6.  Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinators. 

B.  The above officials may delegate authority to administer the oath of office to 

an employee at initial onboarding. 

3-6.  Government Property 

A.  As soon as practicable after appointment, FEMA shall furnish each CORE 
with appropriate mobile communication and/or computing equipment as 
determined by the current property authorization list. 

B.  COREs shall keep the equipment charged and accessible, and shall seek 

prompt assistance for malfunctioning equipment. 

C.  All COREs are required to accept receipt of all FEMA-issued equipment and 
sign FEMA Form 119-7-1-3. By signing this form, the CORE acknowledges 

35 

 
 
 
 
acceptance of and responsibility for the equipment and becomes a Custodian 
of the equipment, as set forth in FEMA Directive 119-7, Federal Personal 
Property Management, dated September 24, 2013. Violation of this 
agreement may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal. 

D.  COREs shall only use, display, or present their FEMA-issued government 

identification card for lawful and authorized purposes. 

3-7.  Reassignments to a New Position 

If a CORE is reassigned to a new position, the CORE must meet the minimum 
qualifications for the position and an Office or Directorate head must approve the 
reassignment. 

3-8.  Detail Assignments 

A.  A CORE may be temporarily placed on a detail to carry out a discrete 

function. If a CORE is placed on a detail, the duties and responsibilities 
performed by the CORE must be payable under the Stafford Act with the 
exception described in part C below. 

B.  Details to perform Stafford Act activities. Absent approval from OPM, a CORE 
may not be detailed to a competitive service position. A CORE may be placed 
on a detail assignment for up to 120 days that may be renewed for one 
additional 120 day period. OCCHCO must approve a CORE detailed to a 
position for more than 120 days or to positions at a higher pay level. See 
Chapter 14 for more information on rotational assignments. 

C.  A CORE may be detailed for mission and operational needs or for training to 

perform non-Stafford Act activities described below:  

1.  Non-Stafford Act Mission and Operational Detail. Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 

314 the Administrator is vested with the authority to carry out all 
authorities of FEMA. Upon a determination that urgent and compelling 
circumstances exist in order to carry out the FEMA mission or support to 
other Federal agency incident operations, a CORE may be placed on a 
temporary detail to perform non-Stafford Act activities under the following 
conditions:  

i.  The detail shall not exceed 90 days per appointment unless approved 

by OCC; and  

ii.  The detailed CORE’s salaries, benefits, and associated expenses must 
be paid from the account normally charged for carrying out the gaining 
program or activity for the duration of the detail. 

iii.  Note that training activities and other duties needed to prepare a 

CORE for a mission essential detail may be conducted outside of the 
90 day detail period but must be justified and approved in advance. In 
such circumstances, the training time and the detail time, will be 
charged to the receiving program or office. 

36 

 
 
 
2.  Non-Stafford Act Training Details. FEMA may authorize a non-Stafford Act 

detail of COREs under the following conditions:  

i.  A determination must be made that the training of the CORE, and thus 
the increased ability of that CORE to carry out future Stafford Act 
activities, is the primary purpose and benefit of the non-Stafford Act 
assignment;  

ii.  The detail may not exceed 30 days without a determination that a 

detail of more than 30 days is warranted;  

iii.  Extensions of these details beyond 30 days are made every 30 days 

thereafter and shall not exceed 90 days per appointment; and 

iv.   The detailed COREs may have their salaries and benefits funded by 

the DRF. 

3.  COREs carrying-out non-Stafford Act activities must be justified as either 
an urgent and compelling mission/operation-related detail or a training 
assignment. Under no circumstances, may FEMA use both of these 
justifications for the same non-Stafford Act activity. In both instances, the 
CORE is limited to one non-Stafford Act detail per appointment, unless 
approved by OCC.  

3-9.  Reappointment Procedures 

A.  OCCHCO provides each Office and Directorate with a list of COREs and their 

expiration dates on a biweekly basis. 

B.   A CORE’s appointment will end on the Not-to-Exceed (NTE) date of his or her 
appointment, unless it is renewed by the Office or Directorate. All requests to 
renew the appointment of a current CORE must be submitted by the 
supervisor of record to OCCHCO using an SF-52, Request for Personnel 
Action. 

C.  Two months before the end of a CORE’s appointment, if a supervisor of 

record determines that a CORE’s appointment should not be renewed, the 
supervisor must contact OCCHCO/Employee Relations on how to notify the 
CORE that the CORE’s appointment will not be renewed.   

3-10.  Resignation 

COREs may resign at any time prior to the termination or expiration of their 
appointments. COREs must state in writing the reason for the resignation and the 
requested effective date of the resignation. A CORE may request rescission of 
the resignation prior to the effective date, but FEMA is not obligated to consider 
or grant such a request. FEMA is not obligated to grant the request in order to 
avoid removal for misconduct or poor performance. FEMA may not deny the 
request for any reason prohibited by Title 29, U.S. Code, or any applicable EEOC 
regulations. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 4:  COMPENSATION PROVISIONS 

4-1.  Applicability 

The compensation provided to COREs includes the provisions found in this 
Chapter regardless of the pay plan covering the CORE, unless otherwise stated. 

4-2.  Establishment of CORE Pay Plan 

COREs are paid via an administratively determined “IC” pay plan. COREs paid 
via the GS scale or GS based pay bands will be transferred to the IC pay plan of 
either grades and steps or pay bands at their current rate of pay. FEMA 
managers, in conjunction with OCCHCO, are given the option to utilize one of 
two pay scales; a pay scale consisting of pay bands or a pay scale consisting of 
grades and steps (see Chapters 5 and 6). Offices or Directorates may change 
the pay plan for all COREs assigned to the Office or Directorate with OCCHCO 
approval. 

4-3.  Conversion Actions 

The first-level supervisor may recommend adjustment of pay upon conversion 
from another FEMA appointment to a CORE appointment (see sections 5-3 and 
6-3 for information on conversions that result in a decrease in pay). 

4-4.  Position Management and Classification 

The Position Management and Classification Manual, FM 252-2-1, June 19, 
2014, provides guidance for the classification and position management of 
CORE positions. The rules and procedures for position classification reviews 
(i.e., desk audits) and classification appeals found in FM 252-2-1 do not apply to 
CORE positions. 

4-5.  Locality Pay 

A.  Locality pay is an additional sum of money administratively-determined by 
OCCHCO and added to a CORE’s base pay to account for the difference 
between the pay of government workers and private sector workers in a given 
geographic location. Locality pay is considered a part of basic pay and is 
applied to the minimum and maximum rates of each pay plan.  

B.  COREs, such as IM COREs, who physically work full time from their 

residence of record, will receive the locality pay assigned to their residence of 
record’s locality pay area, even if the CORE reports or is assigned to a FEMA 
fixed facility with a different locality pay rate.  

C.  When a CORE moves from an official duty station in one locality pay area to 

an official duty station in a different locality pay area, OCCHCO will adjust the 
CORE’s basic pay to reflect the difference in the administratively-determined 
locality pay rates. Pay retention is not applicable to geographic changes in 
locality. 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4-6.  Cost of Living Increase 

OCCHCO may periodically recommend that the Administrator adjust pay scales 
for the CORE program. For example, an adjustment may be appropriate to reflect 
a cost of living increase, but need not coincide with changes to pay and wage 
schedules by Congress, OPM, or OPM’s designee. In such circumstances, 
OCCHCO will review current CORE pay rates and recommend the proper 
percentage adjustment that is appropriate. 

4-7.  Pay Ceilings and Premium Pay 

Absent a waiver for the bi-weekly pay cap, the maximum rate of basic pay for a 
FLSA-exempt CORE may not exceed the rate payable for Level V of the 
Executive Schedule or the rate for GS-15 Step 10 employees (including locality 
pay), whichever is higher (see FM 253-2-1, Premium Pay). The maximum 
aggregate amount any CORE may receive in basic pay, bonuses, and 
allowances is the rate for Level I of the Executive Schedule. 

The rules and regulations governing premium pay, including, but not limited to, 
the bi-weekly and annual pay caps, overtime, compensatory time off, and night 
differential for COREs is found in FM 253-2-1, Premium Pay. 

4-8.  Recruitment, Relocation, or Retention Incentives 

A.  In General 

1.  A recruitment incentive is a one-time, lump-sum payment to a newly 

appointed CORE to a position that is determined to be critical to FEMA’s 
mission and in the absence of the incentive, would be difficult to fill. 

2.  A relocation incentive is a one-time, lump-sum payment to a current 

CORE who agrees to relocate with no break in service to accept a FEMA 
position in a different geographic area if the position is likely to be difficult 
to fill in the absence of the incentive. 

3.  A retention incentive is paid to a current CORE if the CORE has unusually 
high or unique qualifications, or an Office or Directorate has a special 
need for the CORE’s services that makes it essential to retain the CORE, 
and the CORE would likely leave the Federal service in the absence of a 
retention incentive. The CORE must have stated an intent to resign or 
retire, in writing, or must have submitted his or her resignation or 
retirement paperwork prior to authorization. 

4.  The employing office must consider at least the following factors, as 
applicable to the case at hand, when deciding whether to pay a 
recruitment or relocation incentive: 

i.  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for similar positions, 
including indicators such as offer acceptance rates, the proportion of 
positions filled, and the length of time required to fill similar positions; 

ii.  Recent turnover in similar positions; 

39 

 
 
 
iii.  Labor-market factors that may affect the ability of the office to recruit 

candidates for similar positions now or in the future; 

iv.  Special qualifications needed for the position; and 

v.  The practicality of using an advanced rate alone or in combination with 

a recruitment or relocation incentive. 

5.  The employing office must consider at least the following factors, as 

applicable to the case at hand, when deciding whether to pay a retention 
incentive: 

i.  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates and retain 

employees with qualifications similar to those possessed by the CORE 
for positions similar to the position held by the CORE; and 

ii.  The availability in the labor market of candidates for employment who, 

with minimal training or disruption of service to the public, could 
perform the full range of duties and responsibilities assigned to the 
position held by the CORE. 

6.  The use of a recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive is not to be 
used as a substitute for traditional recruiting efforts that could yield a 
competent and qualified employee without the use of such an incentive.  

B.  Justification and Approval. The Selecting Official or supervisor of record shall 
submit a justification for any request for a recruitment, relocation, or retention 
incentive through the head of his or her Office or Directorate for approval. 
Office or Directorate heads may approve an incentive amount less than 
$20,000, or less than 25% of a CORE’s base pay. Any incentive request with 
a lump sum greater than or equal to $20,000, or greater than or equal to 25% 
of a CORE’s base pay must be submitted by the Associate Administrator or 
Office Chief (if the Office Chief reports directly to the Administrator) 
overseeing the requesting organization and be approved by the Administrator 
or designee, but at least by the Chief of Staff and OCCHCO. In all cases, 
OCCHCO must approve the incentive request and OCFO must certify the 
availability of funds prior to authorizing payment. All justifications shall 
include, at a minimum, the following information: 

1.  The amount and timing of the approved incentive; 

2.  For retention incentives, the payment schedule for the incentives and the 

maximum number of payments or end date for the payments; and 

3.  The basis for determination that the skills and work experience of the 
applicant or CORE are of substantial value, or that, without such an 
incentive, the position would be difficult-to-fill. The basis should be based 
on at least one factor from subsection A.4 if a recruitment or relocation 
bonus, or one factor from subsection A.5 if a retention incentive. 

C.  COREs who receive a recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive must sign 
and comply with the terms of a Continuing Service Agreement (CSA). See 
Chapter 15, Continuing Service Agreements, for more information.

4-9.  Offset Provision for Civilian Retirees 

A.  Retirees from the federal service who are receiving a federal retirement 

annuity and become reemployed by the federal government, absent a waiver, 
will have their salaries reduced by the amount of the annuity they are entitled 
to receive during the period of reemployment, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 8344(a). 

B.  COREs who are reemployed annuitants must provide OCCHCO with a copy 

of their most recent annuity notice issued by OPM, and all subsequent notices 
of change, indicating the monthly annuity amount to the Payroll and 
Processing Operations Division, OCCHCO prior to or at the time of 
appointment.

CHAPTER 5:  COMPENSATION (PAY BANDS) 

5-1.  General 

A.  This Chapter addresses the rules and procedures associated with 

compensating COREs via pay bands, which is one of the pay scales under 
the IC pay plan.  

B.  Each pay band established for the IC pay plan corresponds to a range of pay 
and classification levels, such that bands replace grades and steps, and 
series are retained. Positions are classified by title, career path, and 
occupational series. The pay range for each pay band is equivalent to the pay 
range of GS and IC grades and steps within the pay band. A CORE may not 
receive base pay in excess of his or her pay band unless they are promoted 
to a position classified at a higher pay band. 

1.  Band 1 corresponds to GS 1 to GS 6. 

2.  Band 2 corresponds to GS 7 to GS 9. 

3.  Band 3 corresponds to GS 10 to GS 11. 

4.  Band 4 corresponds to GS 12 to GS 13. 

5.  Band 5 corresponds to GS 14 to GS 15. 

C.  The major duties and responsibilities of each CORE position are included in 
the position description. The position description is analyzed by a Human 
Resources Classification Specialist to determine the title and pay band of the 
position. This analysis of the work to be performed and comparison of the 
work to established standards is referred to as position classification and 
applies the principle of equal pay for equal work. 

D.  Exceptions to the policies and procedures contained within this Chapter may 
be authorized by the CCHCO to respond to an emergent and unexpected 
mission need arising from a Level I disaster, to alleviate severe hardship to 
individuals resulting from any error on the part of FEMA in effecting personnel 
actions, or to address unusual situations that were not anticipated when this 
policy was drafted. 

5-2.  Setting Basic Rate of Pay 

A.  The Selecting Official is delegated the authority to assign a yearly basic pay 
amount within the position classified pay band. Pay setting criteria may 
include:  

1.  The prior salary of the candidate;  

2.  The overall qualifications of the candidate;  

3.  The recency of the individual’s relevant experience;  

4.  The qualifications and pay of employees in similar positions in the work 

unit;  

42 

 
 
5.  Salary comparability to non-Federal pay rates for similar work;  

6.  Special qualification requirements associated with the vacant position;  

7.  Turnover rates for the position;  

8.  Scarcity of qualified candidates; or 

9.  Programmatic urgency. 

B.  Any request for a rate above the minimum rate within the position classified 
pay band(s) must include a justification drafted by the Selecting Official and 
approved by the second level supervisor. This justification must include:  

1.  The candidate’s name; 

2.  The title, grade, and recommended rate of the vacant position; and 

3.  The factors and determination that support the pay rate determination. 

C.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and in accordance with Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission regulations, the justification for setting pay higher 
than the minimum rate shall be preserved for one year from the date of its 
making. 

5-3.  Pay Adjustments 

Adjustments to pay within a classified pay band may be requested by the 
supervisor of record for review and approval by the Human Resources Specialist 
without written justification or approval from the second level supervisor. Such 
adjustments may be given under the following circumstances: 

A.  Reassignment of a CORE from one position to another position within the 

same classified pay band if the responsibilities of the new position warrant an 
increase or decrease in base pay to further the principles of equal pay for 
equal work; 

B.  A pay change, of either an increase or decrease, to compensate for an 

increase or decrease in locality pay in conjunction with a move to another 
geographic area; or 

C.  Receipt of a merit-based increase (see section 5-4). 

5-4.  Merit-Based Increase 

A.  A CORE who is not already receiving the maximum basic pay for his or her 

position may receive a merit-based increase at the conclusion of the 
performance year. 

B.  A CORE, who receives a rating of record of “Achieved Expectations”, or 
equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based increase of up to 3%; a rating of 
record of “Exceeded Expectations” or equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based 
increase of up to 4%; or a rating of record of “Achieved Excellence” or 
equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based increase of up to 5%. 

43 

 
 
 
C.  A CORE, who receives a rating of “unacceptable”, or equivalent, is not eligible 

for a merit-based increase.8 

D.  A CORE’s supervisor of record must send an SF-52, approved by the second 

level supervisor, to the Payroll and Processing Division, OCCHCO for 
processing, certifying that the CORE has received an annual rating of record 
for the most recent performance cycle and that the percentage increase to 
basic pay sought by the supervisor of record is in compliance with the 
requirements established by section 5-3 above. 

5-5.  Promotion 

A.  A promotion is a personnel action that moves a CORE from one classified 
band to another in the same career path. A promotion may also be the 
selection and appointment of a CORE to a position in another career path or 
region to which the CORE applies. This may result in a combination of an 
increase in the CORE’s salary and a change in position description. If the 
CORE is moved to a different position, in the same pay band, with the same 
or similar duties, the personnel action is a reassignment with retained pay.  

B.  The CORE’s supervisor of record must certify that the CORE’s most recent 
performance rating was at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent, next 
higher graded work exists for the CORE to perform, the CORE’s new position 
description captures the duties to be performed, and the higher graded 
position is approved and funded. A CORE may be hired into a position in a 
higher pay band via vacancy announcement or a name request, if the Office 
or Directorate has an existing higher position available or creates a new 
position according to the procedures detailed in section 2-2. 

C.  The new basic pay rate upon promotion may be set at any level in the new 
band, but the CORE must receive at least a six percent minimum pay 
increase over his or her previous salary. If the CORE moves to a different 
career path, any band in the new career path would be considered a “new 
band” for the purposes of determining his or her salary. 

5-6.  Change to a Lower Pay Band 

When a CORE moves from his or her current position to a position at a lower pay 
band the action is referred to as a change to a lower pay band. The 
circumstances underlying the supervisor’s recommendation to initiate a change 
to a lower pay band will determine how pay is set. 

A.  A CORE who exhibits poor performance and fails to improve acceptably will 
be terminated (see Chapter 11 for more information). In rare occasions, 
COREs may be demoted in lieu of removal due to poor performance. In such 
circumstances, pay is set at a lower pay band such that there is a reduction in 

8 Supervisors who encounter poor performance should consult Chapter 11: Procedures for 
Misconduct and Poor Performance. 

44 

 
 
 
                                                           
pay equivalent to at least two steps (using the pay intervals from the grades 
and steps scale) below the higher banded position.  

B.  When a CORE requests a change to lower pay band for personal reasons or 
convenience, including through application for an announced vacancy at a 
lower pay band, the action is considered a voluntary change to a lower pay 
band. For voluntary changes to a lower pay band, the new rate will be set 
according to the procedures in section 5-2, and should include any merit 
based increases that the CORE would have received during the qualified 
period. 

C.  The reclassification of a position by OCCHCO to a lower pay band will result 
in a reduction in pay and pay will be set in accordance with the classification 
decision. Pay will be set according to the procedures detailed in section 5-2. 
No appeal of the reclassification decision or pay retention is permitted, 
subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

45 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 6:  COMPENSATION (GRADES AND STEPS) 

6-1.  General 

A.   A CORE may be paid via an administratively-determined “IC” grades and 

steps pay scale, as described in this Chapter. The pay scale consists of 15 
pay grades (IC-1 to IC-15) with 10 steps per grade. The pay sums associated 
with the IC pay scale mirror the GS scale. 

For example, a CORE hired at IC-11, Step 1 under the IC pay plan would be 
paid at the same basic rate of pay as a GS-11, Step 1 employee under the 
GS scale.  

B.  Exceptions to the policies and procedures contained within this Chapter may 
be authorized by the CCHCO to respond to an emergent and unexpected 
mission need arising from a Level 1 disaster, to alleviate severe hardship to 
individuals resulting from any error on the part of FEMA in effecting personnel 
actions or to address unusual situations that were not anticipated when this 
policy was drafted. 

6-2.  Setting Basic Rate of Pay 

A.  The position description is the primary source of information used in setting 
pay in the IC pay series. Other information used in setting pay is (1) the 
geographic location (official duty station) of the position; and, (2) the 
individual’s prior employment, salary history, and qualifications. 

B.  The major duties and responsibilities of each CORE position are included in 
its position description. The position description is analyzed by a Human 
Resources Specialist to determine the title and grade range of the position. 
This analysis of the work to be performed and comparison of the work to 
established standards is referred to as position classification and applies the 
principle of equal pay for equal work. 

C.  A new appointment is an individual’s first appointment as an employee of the 
Federal government. Pay for all new COREs will be set at the minimum rate 
(Step 1) of the grade of the position, unless the CORE is approved for an 
advanced rate (see part E Advanced to a Higher Step). 

D.  If the CORE has prior federal service (including as a current or former FEMA 
employee), OCCHCO sets the basic rate of pay at the minimum rate for the 
position, unless they receive an advanced rate (as discussed below) or the 
highest pay rate previously received during Federal service, whichever is 
higher.9 Before setting pay at the highest pay rate previously received during 
Federal service, the Selecting Official should consider: 

1.  The overall qualifications of the individual; 

2.  The recency of the individual’s relevant experience; 

9 If the employee’s highest previously-received pay rate falls between two steps of the IC pay 
scale, the Selecting Official may request that the employee’s pay be set at the higher step. 

46 

 
 
                                                           
3.  The qualifications and pay of employees in similar positions in the work 

unit; and 

4.  The potential impact on the morale of those employees if the candidate 

were to receive the maximum payable rate. 

E.  Advanced to a Higher Step.  

1.  Prior to a candidate entering on duty, the Selecting Official will consider 
whether pay above the minimum rate of the grade should be made for a 
CORE. 

2.  Pay rate decisions maintain equity between the pay of the new hire and 

that of current employees, including COREs, performing comparable work. 
The advanced rate may not exceed step 10 of the applicable grade to 
which the candidate will be hired. 

3.  Required documentation and approval: 

i.  A request to advance a CORE up to step four may be submitted by the 
first or second level supervisor to OCCHCO for approval. A request to 
advance a CORE to step five and above must be submitted by the 
head of an Office or Directorate to OCCHCO for approval. The request 
must be accompanied by a written justification that includes: 

a.   The candidate’s name; 

b.  The title, grade, and recommended rate of the vacant position; and 

c.  The factors and determination that support the pay rate 

determination. This may include, but is not limited to, salary 
comparability, special qualification requirements, turnover rates, 
scarcity of qualified candidates, or programmatic urgency. 

ii.  The first or second level supervisor must submit a recommendation for 
an advanced rate appointment well in advance of establishing an 
entrance on duty date to ensure sufficient time for OCCHCO to act on 
the request before the appointment becomes effective. 

iii.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and in accordance with EEOC 

regulations, the justification shall be preserved for one year from the 
date of its making. 

6-3.  Pay Adjustments 

Adjustments to pay within a grade after the pay rate is initially set may be given 
under the following circumstances: 

A.  Reassignment of a CORE from one position to another position if the 

responsibilities of the new position warrant an increase or decrease in base 
pay to further the principles of equal pay for equal work; 

47 

 
 
B.  A pay change, of either an increase or decrease, to compensate for an 

increase or decrease in locality pay in conjunction with a move to a different 
official duty station in another geographic area; or 

C.  Receipt of a step increase (see section 6-4). 

6-4.  Step Increases 

A.  A CORE who is not already at the highest step of his or her current grade 
may be advanced to the next higher step at the conclusion of the waiting 
period assigned to their current rate. 

1.  While FEMA’s Stafford Act authorities permit FEMA the authority to 

compensate without regard to Title 5, FEMA adopts the waiting periods for 
advancement to the next highest step established by 5 U.S.C. § 5335 and 
its implementing regulation at 5 C.F.R. § 531.405 as a matter of policy for 
all COREs paid via grades and steps. 

2.  A CORE is not automatically entitled to receive a step increase at the 

conclusion of his or her waiting period.  

3.  To receive the step increase, the CORE’s supervisor of record must sign 
the step increase document and return to OCCHCO for processing, 
certifying that the CORE: 

i.  Has completed the requisite waiting period;  

ii.  Has not received an equivalent increase during the waiting period; and  

iii.  His or her summary rating level for the most recent performance was 

at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent. 

4.  If a supervisor determines that a CORE’s performance is not at an 

acceptable level, the supervisor should contact OCCHCO/Employee 
Relations at least two months before the end of the required waiting period 
for a step increase, to draft a notification to the CORE stating that the 
CORE’s next step increase is being withheld, the reason for the negative 
determination, and what the CORE must do to improve his or her 
performance to be granted the step increase. 

B.  Prior to the completion of the requisite waiting period, a supervisor may 
recommend one additional step increase if warranted by the CORE’s 
performance. To receive the additional step increase, the CORE’s supervisor 
of record must send a justification describing the accomplishments and 
performance exhibited by the CORE that would warrant an increase in pay, 
and an SF-52 approved by the second level supervisor to OCCHCO for 
processing. OCCHCO will review the request to ensure COREs who exhibit 
similar performance receive similar pay. 

48 

 
 
 
6-5.  Promotion 

A.  A promotion is a personnel action that moves a qualified CORE from one 

grade to another in the same career path or to a grade in another career path 
in combination with an increase in the CORE’s salary. 

B.  The CORE’s supervisor of record must certify that the CORE’s most recent 
performance rating was at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent, next 
higher graded work exists for the CORE to perform, the CORE’s new position 
description captures the duties to be performed, and the higher graded 
position is approved and funded. A CORE may be hired into a position at a 
higher grade via vacancy announcement or a name request, if the Office or 
Directorate has an existing higher graded position available or creates a new 
position according to the procedures detailed in section 2-2.  

C.  For promotions, pay is set at the lowest pay rate in the new grade; however, 
the new pay rate must exceed the CORE’s existing pay rate by at least two 
steps. If the annual rate of the new position falls between two steps of the 
new grade, the higher step may be used. For example, an IC-7, Step 3 at 
FEMA HQ, with an annual pay rate of $45,473, who is promoted to an IC-8, is 
entitled to at least an increase in pay equal to two steps from the position 
from which she was promoted at IC-7 Step 5, or $48,315. Because the annual 
pay rate for an IC-8, Step 1 is $47,212, it does not satisfy the two-step 
increase requirement. Therefore, pay is set at IC-8, Step 2 or $48,786. 

6-6.  Change to Lower Grade 

When a CORE moves from his or her current position to a position at a lower 
grade the action is referred to as a change to lower grade. The circumstances 
underlying the supervisor’s recommendation to initiate a change to lower grade 
will determine how pay is set. 

A.  A CORE who exhibits poor performance and fails to improve acceptably will 
be terminated (see Chapter 11 for more information). In rare occasions, 
COREs may be demoted in lieu of removal due to poor performance. Upon 
demotion, the pay rate must be set at least two steps below the current pay 
rate. If the two-step reduction results in a rate that falls between two steps of 
the lower grade, the lower step must be used. 

B.  When a CORE requests a change to lower grade for personal reasons or 
convenience, including through application for an announced vacancy at a 
lower grade, the action is considered a voluntary change to a lower grade. 
For voluntary changes to a lower grade, the new rate should include any step 
increase that the CORE would have received during the qualifying period and 
pay should be set at: 

1.  The minimum  payable rate of basic pay for the lower grade; or 

2.  The highest previous rate received under Federal service, if the action is 
fair and equitable after considering the factors listed in section 6-2, and if 
the action serves the convenience of the Government. 

49 

 
 
C.  The reclassification of a position by OCCHCO to a lower grade range will 
result in a reduction in pay and pay will be set in accordance with the 
classification decision. Pay will be set according to the procedures detailed in 
section 6-2. No appeal of the reclassification decision or pay retention is 
permitted, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

50 

 
 
 
7-1.  General 

CHAPTER 7:  BENEFITS 

A.  With certain exceptions that apply to individuals such as reemployed 

annuitants, CORE are eligible for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB), 
Federal Employees Dental/Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP), Federal 
Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI), Federal Employees Retirement 
System (FERS), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Federal Long Term Care 
Insurance (FLTCIP), and participation in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). 

B.  COREs must review their benefit options and make selections within 

prescribed election periods. OCCHCO, Employee Services Division, will 
provide timely information to COREs with regard to available benefit options, 
election periods, and technical direction regarding how to apply for these 
options.  

C.  OCCHCO staff is prohibited from making any type of recommendation that 
may influence a CORE’s benefit election. COREs need to evaluate cost, 
personal needs, and eligible family members and their needs when preparing 
to make a benefits selection. 

D.  FEMA applies guidance contained within OPM Benefits Administration Letter, 
No. 13-203, when extending benefits to legally married same-sex spouses 
and common law marriages in certain states, of Federal employees and 
annuitants, and to the children of those marriages. 

7-2.  Health Benefits 

A.  COREs are given an opportunity to enroll in the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program (FEHB) at the time of appointment to a CORE position. 

B.  A CORE must decide whether to elect to enroll in FEHB within 60 days after 
the effective date of appointment. A CORE who elects to enroll must submit 
SF-2809 to his or her HR Specialist. A CORE who fails to return the 
completed form within the prescribed time frame, or who cancels enrollment 
will not have another opportunity to enroll until an FEHB open season is 
offered (generally once per year), or as a result of a Qualifying Life Event 
(QLE). 

C.  The CORE’s share of the premium for the benefits plan chosen will be 

deducted from the CORE’s bi-weekly pay on a pre-tax basis.  A CORE may 
cancel health benefits coverage during an extended period of non-pay status 
or may continue the coverage and pay the premium each pay period or upon 
return to pay status. Effective dates for enrollment, changes in enrollment, 
and cancellation of enrollment will be established in accordance with 
guidance prescribed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 

51 

 
 
7-3.  FEDVIP (Dental and Vision) Program 

A.  The Federal Employees’ Dental/Vision Program (FEDVIP) is a supplemental 
program offering vision and dental coverage to Federal employees, retirees, 
and their eligible family members on an enrollee-pay-all basis.  

B.  COREs, retirees, and their eligible family members are eligible to enroll in 

FEDVIP if they are eligible to enroll in FEHB and the CORE’s position is not 
excluded by law or regulation.10 COREs who are not enrolled in FEHB may 
still be eligible for FEDVIP, providing they are eligible to enroll in FEHB. 

C.  New and newly eligible COREs may enroll within 60 days after they become 
eligible. COREs may also enroll during the annual Federal Benefits Open 
Season in November and December. 

7-4.  Life Insurance 

Unless a CORE elects to waive coverage prior to the end of the pay period in 
which appointed, eligible COREs are automatically insured for basic life coverage 
on the day the CORE enters on duty in a pay status. Within 60 days after the 
effective date of appointment to a CORE position, a CORE who has basic life 
insurance coverage may also elect standard, additional, and/or family optional 
insurance. A CORE may decrease or waive all life insurance coverage at any 
time. Effective dates of life insurance coverage and waivers will be in accordance 
with the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and OPM 
guidance. FEGLI is not included in the annual benefits open season and open 
season periods are rare. 

7-5.  Retirement 

A.  As a general rule, employees appointed to CORE positions are automatically 
covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Exceptions 
include certain former Federal employees who were hired prior to January 1, 
1984, and were covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). 
Retirement coverage, whether FERS, CSRS, or CSRS Offset, begins on the 
effective date of appointment to a CORE position.  

B.  COREs who are covered by FERS, and first appointed: 

1.  Before 2013, contribute 0.8% of pay to the Civil Service Retirement and 

Disability Fund (CSRDF); 

2.  In 2013, contribute 3.1% of pay to the CSRDF; or 

3.  After December 31, 2013, contribute 4.4% of pay to the CSRDF. 

4.  Employee contributions to the CSRDF may change according to changes 

in the FERS program. 

10 See 5 C.F.R. § 894.302 or an HR Specialist to determine whether a position is excluded from 
FEDVIP. 

52 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
7-6.  Thrift Savings Plan 

A.  The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a tax-deferred retirement savings and 

investment plan that provides COREs with an opportunity to save a portion of 
their income for retirement and reduce current taxes.  

B.  Eligibility for participation is determined by FEMA in accordance with law and 
TSP regulations published by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. 

C.  COREs, covered by FERS, appointed after July 31, 2010, are automatically 

enrolled in the TSP. 

D.  COREs can elect, change their election, or stop their contributions at any time 
through the Employee Personal Page (EPP) or by completing and submitting 
a TSP-1 Election form. 

7-7.  Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program 

Long-Term Care insurance provides financial protection to enrollees who are in 
need of assistance with their daily activities due to a lengthy or lifelong illness, 
injury, or cognitive impairment. Long-Term Care insurance is medically 
underwritten; therefore, a CORE and eligible family members must qualify for the 
insurance. Eligible COREs can enroll at any time; however, newly-hired COREs 
and their spouses receive a 60-day window to enroll using an abbreviated 
underwriting process. 

7-8.  Flexible Spending Accounts 

Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) allows COREs to set aside money on a pre-
tax basis to cover out-of-pocket health care or dependent care expenses. A 
newly eligible CORE has 60 days from the date of his or her appointment to elect 
to set aside this money by payroll deduction. A CORE who wishes to participate 
or continue to participate from one plan year to the next must make a positive 
election during the annual open season, which runs concurrent with the health 
insurance open season. Changes can be made outside of the benefits open 
season as a result of a Qualifying Life Event (QLE). 

7-9.  Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 

COREs have access to confidential work life enhancement services through the 
EAP, free of charge. The EAP is a professional resource available to help 
COREs resolve life challenges. A CORE may call the toll-free EAP number at 1-
800-222-0364, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A CORE can also access EAP 
services online at www.FOH4you.com. 

7-10.  Transit Subsidy Program 

Subject to the availability of funds, all COREs who are currently using public 
transportation to commute to work are eligible for transit subsidy benefits.  The 
Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Support Services and Facilities 
Management Division (SSFMD), administers the transit subsidy program. 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
COREs interested in receiving a transit subsidy must complete FEMA Form 254-
1-1, Public Transportation Benefit Program Application, and email it to the Transit 
Subsidy Program at FEMA-Transit-Subsidy@fema.dhs.gov.  

54 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 8:  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT 

8-1.  General 

A.  CORE performance management shall comply with the Employee 

Performance Management Program as established by FM 255-1-1. 

B.  A CORE who receives a rating of unacceptable, or equivalent, on his or her 

most recent appraisal (rating of record) may be subject to removal in 
accordance with Chapter 11 of this Manual. Such removal should be effected 
regardless of the timing of the CORE’s NTE date. However, a supervisor is 
not precluded from terminating a CORE prior to issuance of a performance 
appraisal, so long as the supervisor has sufficient documentation to justify the 
action and has consulted with an OCCHCO Employee Relations Specialist. 

8-2.  Performance Management for CORE-Is 

The performance of IMAT members appointed as CORE-Is are subject to FD 
010-7, and are not covered by FEMA Manual 255-1-1 or this Chapter. 

8-3.  Deployment Performance Management 

A.  When deployed to a disaster for twenty days or more, a CORE qualified in a 
FQS position, and deployed to that position, will receive an evaluation of the 
CORE’s deployment performance by a temporary duty supervisor. The 
evaluation period consists of the entire time the CORE is deployed. 

B.  COREs will be evaluated on their performance based on the performance 

goals developed by Cadre Coordinators for each position within a Cadre. The 
goals will align with the position-specific knowledge of program and technical 
protocols contained in the position’s PTB, and the core competencies for 
deployed personnel. 

C.  The temporary duty supervisor will complete a deployment evaluation in a 
timely manner and transmit the evaluation to the CORE’s supervisor of 
record. Additionally, the HR Unit Leader and his or her staff will ensure that 
any demobilized CORE who is deployed for at least twenty days is issued a 
performance evaluation prior to departing the incident work site. 

D.  If a CORE’s deployment performance does not meet achieved expectations, 
the CORE’s supervisor of record in coordination with the Cadre Coordinator 
and/or temporary duty supervisor will collaborate with OCCHCO to determine 
the appropriate course of action. 

E.  A CORE’s progress review and appraisal (rating of record) should include 
input received after a deployment from the temporary duty supervisor. 
However, the supervisor of record has the discretion to consider the 
deployment performance evaluation as he or she deems appropriate when 
completing progress reviews and the annual appraisal (rating of record) 
subsequent to the deployment. 

55 

 
 
 
F.  If the CORE is deployed at the time that the CORE’s quarterly progress 

review should take place, the supervisor of record will work with the CORE 
and his or her temporary duty supervisor to obtain feedback on the CORE’s 
performance during the applicable quarter. 

56 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 9:  AWARDS AND RECOGNITION 

9-1.  Awards and Recognition Program 

The Awards and Recognition program applicable to Title 5 employees and 
captured in FEMA Manual 255-4-1 is also applicable to COREs, with the 
exception of CORE-Is. Awards and recognition policy applicable to CORE-I 
IMATs is found in FD 010-7. 

57 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 10:  SCHEDULING OF WORK AND TELEWORK 

10-1.  Scheduling of Work and Telework 

A.  FM 106-1-1, Scheduling of Work, applies to all COREs. To establish a work 

schedule a CORE must submit a copy of FEMA Form 106-1-1-1, Request for 
Work Schedule, to his or her supervisor of record for approval.  

B.  COREs will use FEMA approved timekeeping policies and procedures to 

account for all hours of work. 

C.  FM 123-9-1, Telework Manual, applies to all COREs. To establish a telework 
agreement and schedule a CORE must submit a copy of FEMA Form 123-9-
0-1, Telework Application and Agreement Form, and FEMA Form 123-9-0-2, 
Employee Self-Certification Safety and Health Checklist, to his or her 
supervisor of record for approval.  

D.  COREs whose Residence of Record is their permanent duty station are not 

teleworking when on duty. However, all COREs whose Residence of Record 
is their official duty station must have a completed and approved Employee 
Self-Certification Safety and Health Checklist forms on-file with FEMA prior to 
being permitted to work.  

58 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 11:  PROCEDURES FOR MISCONDUCT AND POOR PERFORMANCE 

11-1.  General 

A.  COREs are non-Title 5 employees and, therefore normally do not have 

appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

B.  Supervisors must communicate proper conduct and performance standards. 
Supervisors must also set an example for proper conduct and performance 
for their subordinates. 

C.   Supervisors must identify and deal with misconduct and unacceptable 

performance as they occur. 

D.  Supervisors must document problems as they occur and follow up with 

COREs to ensure they understand the seriousness of their behavior and/or 
performance deficiencies. Documentation does not have to be lengthy. It can 
be a brief summary of key facts and issues, with names, dates and times that 
the incident(s) occurred. This documentation must be created in a timely 
manner and preserved for potential litigation and may be subject to discovery.  

E.  Supervisors should immediately contact their servicing Employee Relations 

Specialist when misconduct or performance issues occur to obtain advice and 
guidance before taking any official action. If this issue involves misconduct, 
supervisors must report the matter as required by FD 123-19, paragraph III.D.  

F.  When making a determination of lack of fitness to encumber a FEMA position, 
or that the CORE’s security clearance is being suspended or revoked under 
DHS Instruction 121-01-007, OCSO shall immediately notify Employee 
Relations. 

11-2.  Addressing Misconduct 

A.  Misconduct must be reported to FEMA HQ in accordance with FD 123-19, 

Administrative Investigations Directive (AID), and, depending on the status of 
the CORE and the alleged misconduct, to the DHS OIG. It can be difficult to 
determine whether a CORE’s actions constitute misconduct or poor 
performance, or whether suspected misconduct triggers the requirements to 
report the suspected misconduct to DHS OIG or the AID Committee. As such, 
consultation with OCCHCO is critical to determining the proper course of 
action. The Employee Relations Specialist will recommend the appropriate 
option and provide the required documentation to the manager for issuance to 
the CORE. FD 123-19 and its accompanying Manual, FM 123-19-1, provide 
procedures for reporting misconduct and investigating it prior to determining if 
disciplinary action for any substantiated misconduct is to be recommended. 

B.  Options to Address Misconduct 

1.  Counseling. A counsel is an informal verbal advisement by a supervisor 
to a CORE of misconduct that must be corrected, yet which avoids any 
lasting adverse effect on a CORE’s personnel record. The purpose of 
counseling is to correct misconduct problems soon after they occur in 

59 

 
 
order to prevent the need for formal discipline. Counseling is an 
appropriate response to minor misconduct when the CORE has a 
generally good record, with no prior instances of misconduct, and is 
committed to correcting the problem. Documentation is not required; 
however, a follow-up e-mail recounting the conversation entitled 
“Discussion dated XX” can be provided to the CORE and is strongly 
recommended. At a minimum the supervisor shall send an email to 
himself or herself to document the content of the conversation. Counseling 
can be used to demonstrate that the CORE was put on notice about the 
problem and knew of the potential for a harsh penalty if the problem 
continued. A memorandum documenting the counseling is not placed in 
the CORE’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF). 

2.   Reprimand. A written reprimand is the lowest level of formal discipline 
addressed to the CORE and signed by the immediate supervisor (or 
higher level supervisor in the chain of command). Depending on the 
severity of the misconduct, it may be appropriate for a first offense of 
misconduct, when written formal discipline is necessary or, when verbal 
counseling has been ineffective in correcting misconduct. The reprimand 
should include, as a minimum, the following information: 

i.  Reference previous counseling or other action that was relied on to 

support the action (if any); 

ii.  Advise the CORE of any applicable appeal rights, such as the right to 
file an appeal with the next higher level supervisor within five calendar 
days after receipt of the reprimand; 

iii.  Advise the CORE of the potential negative consequences of future 

misconduct; 

iv.  Advise the CORE of Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services 

available to assist with any work-related or personal concerns that may 
have an impact on performance and/or behavior at work; 

v.  Inform the CORE of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program 
and of his or her right to seek counseling with an EEO advisor if he or 
she believes the reprimand is based on a prohibited factor; 

vi.  State whether a copy of the reprimand will be placed in the CORE’s 

OPF, which may be for a period not to exceed 3 years; 

vii. Identify the servicing Employee Relations Specialist to contact for 

questions concerning the reprimand; and  

viii. Provide a signature line upon which the CORE will acknowledge 

receipt of the notice of reprimand. 

3.  Suspension. A suspension temporarily removes the CORE from the 

performance of duties without pay for a specified period, and is recorded 
in the CORE’s official personnel record. A notice of suspension is a 
memorandum on FEMA letterhead, addressed to the CORE, and signed 

60 

 
by the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor in the chain of 
command. 

i. 

 The supervisor of record forwards a copy of the notice (signed and 
dated by the supervisor) and the SF-52 to the Employee Relations 
Specialist. The Specialist codes the SF-52 and forwards it to the 
OCCHCO for processing. 

ii.   The notice of a suspension should include, as a minimum, the 

following information: 

a.  Identify the specific charge(s), supporting information, regulations 

or policies violated; 

b.  Identify the effective date of the action; 

c.  Advise the CORE of any applicable appeal rights, such as the right 
to appeal the suspension to the next-higher level supervisor within 
five calendar days of receipt of the notice, and of the CORE’s right 
to file a grievance under any applicable collective bargaining 
agreement; 

d.  Inform the CORE of his or her right to seek counseling with an EEO 

advisor if he or she believes the suspension is based on a 
prohibited factor; 

e.  Advise the CORE how to contact the EAP to assist with any work-
related or personal concerns that may have an impact on the 
CORE’s conduct at work; 

f.  Provide the name and telephone number of the servicing Employee 
Relations Specialist whom the CORE may contact for questions; 
and 

g.  Provide a signature line upon which the CORE will acknowledge 

receipt of the notice of suspension. 

4.  Removal from Federal Service. A removal from federal service is 

recorded in the CORE’s personnel record, and is the most severe form of 
discipline available to a manager. Removal may be appropriate when the 
facts and supporting information cause the supervisor to conclude that the 
CORE has demonstrated an unwillingness or refusal to conform to 
acceptable standards of conduct, a lesser penalty would not deter future 
misconduct, or there is little probability of the CORE’s rehabilitation.  

i.  A notice of removal is a memorandum on FEMA Letterhead addressed 
to the CORE from the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor 
in the chain of command). The notice should include the same items 
identified in section 11-2.B.3.ii. (Content of a suspension notice). 

ii.  The CORE’s immediate supervisor, or any higher-level supervisor in 

the CORE’s chain of command, should give the notice to the CORE at 
or before the effective date of the notice and request that the CORE 

61 

 
acknowledge receipt at the bottom of the last page of the notice. If the 
CORE refuses to sign the notice acknowledging receipt, the supervisor 
should place a note on the last page to indicate that the notice was 
given to the CORE and the CORE refused to acknowledge receipt. 
Failure to acknowledge receipt has no impact on implementation of the 
decision. 

5.  Removal Based on a Determination of Lack of Fitness for a FEMA 
Position. All COREs must meet fitness standards established in DHS 
Instruction 121-01-007. 

i.  OCSO has the authority to determine a CORE’s fitness, based on a 
background investigation at the time of entry on duty and every five 
years thereafter (or more frequently as circumstances warrant). 

ii.  When OCSO has determined that a CORE does not meet the fitness 
standard, in accordance with the procedures in DHS Instruction 121-
01-007, OCSO shall notify OCCHCO/Employee Relations, which shall 
coordinate with the CORE’s supervisor and OCSO to deny the CORE 
unescorted access to DHS/FEMA facilities. In addition, DHS Sensitive 
Systems Policy Directive 4300A requires that DHS employees have a 
favorably adjudicated background investigation to be granted access to 
DHS Information Technology systems. Therefore, COREs who do not 
meet the fitness standard are normally required to turn in their FEMA 
equipment (e.g., laptop, Blackberry, etc.) and are placed on non-duty, 
non-pay status. The CORE may request to use any available accrued 
leave during this period. 

iii.  With the concurrence of OCCHCO/Employee Relations and the Office 
of Chief Counsel, the supervisor of record issues a removal decision to 
a CORE under his or her supervision deemed unfit to encumber a 
FEMA position. The notice should include the same items identified in 
section 11-2.B.3.ii. (content of a suspension notice).  

iv.  The removal decision shall include the right to appeal within five 

calendar days after the removal is effective. Appeals from removal 
decisions are decided by the Associate or Deputy Associate 
Administrator, Mission Support. 

6.  Recovery of Government Equipment. Supervisors shall collect all 
government equipment prior to the effective date of the removal. 

11-3.  Addressing Poor Performance 

CORE supervisors and managers should consult FM 255-1-1, Employee 
Performance Management Program, for more information on dealing with poor 
performance. Most performance problems can be resolved through effective 
communication between the supervisor and CORE. The supervisor should, at a 
minimum, take the following steps: 

62 

 
 
A.  Discuss performance deficiencies with any CORE whose performance is 

substandard. This discussion provides the supervisor the opportunity to clarify 
job expectations, and to identify performance deficiencies. It provides the 
CORE with clear direction as to what he or she needs to do to improve his or 
her performance to an acceptable level. The supervisor should document the 
discussion and provide the CORE with a copy of the documentation to 
prevent misunderstandings, or mischaracterization of the discussion.  

B.  Monitor the CORE’s performance following the discussion, and document the 

CORE’s progress toward improving his or her performance. 

C.  The supervisor must discuss the CORE’s performance deficiencies with the 
Employee Relations Specialist for guidance on (1) whether to remove a 
CORE for substandard performance immediately or (2) to provide the CORE 
time to demonstrate improvement, and if so, the length of time to do so. A 
“performance expectations” memorandum is a helpful tool that the supervisor 
can issue to the CORE. The Employee Relations Specialist will assist the 
supervisor with drafting any correspondence regarding performance 
problems. The supervisor will provide the Specialist with a signed and dated 
copy of the final document. The supervisor must document the deficiencies 
with memoranda, emails, work products and any other documentation that 
demonstrates the deficiencies. COREs are not placed on formal Performance 
Improvement Plans (PIPs). 

D.  Removal from Federal Service. 

1.  A removal from federal service is recorded in the CORE’s personnel 

record, and is the most severe form of discipline available to a manager. A 
notice of removal is a memorandum on FEMA Letterhead addressed to 
the CORE from the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor in the 
chain of command). 

2.  The notice should include the same items identified in section 11-2.B.3.ii 

(content of a suspension notice). 

3.  The CORE’s immediate supervisor, or any higher-level supervisor in the 

CORE’s chain of command, must give the notice to the CORE at or before 
the effective date of the notice and request that the CORE acknowledge 
receipt at the bottom of the last page of the notice. If the CORE refuses to 
sign the notice acknowledging receipt, the supervisor should place a note 
on the last page to indicate that the notice was given to the CORE and the 
CORE refused to acknowledge receipt. Failure to acknowledge receipt 
has no impact on implementation of the decision. 

E.  In rare circumstances, the supervisor may initiate a reassignment to another 
position in a lower pay band or IC pay grade, whichever is applicable, in lieu 
of removal, to address poor performance after receiving concurrence from the 
Employee Relations Specialist and the Office of Chief Counsel. In such 
circumstances, the CORE’s rate of pay will be reduced in accordance with 
Chapters 5 and 6. 

63 

 
11-4.  Deployment Scenarios 

COREs may be assigned to perform incident management and incident support 
duties based on the operational needs of FEMA and subject to the policies 
contained within FD 010-8, FEMA Incident Workforce Deployment. During 
deployment, supervisors of record receive feedback on the performance of 
COREs during deployments from the CORE’s temporary duty supervisors. 
Temporary duty supervisors provide day-to-day supervision of the performance 
of deployed COREs. 

A.  Temporary duty supervisors must consult with the supervisor of record and  

OCCHCO/Employee Relations Branch when they encounter poor 
performance, and provide all documents to the supervisor of record. 

B.   Temporary duty supervisors who become aware of allegations of misconduct 
shall notify the supervisor of record of the allegation. The supervisor of record 
shall consult with OCCHCO/Employee Relations before initiating disciplinary 
action. The supervisor of record will notify the temporary duty supervisor of 
any impending disciplinary action. In all cases in which misconduct is alleged, 
the Employee Relations Branch shall provide advice to the Federal 
Coordinating Officer (FCO) and the supervisor of record as to the propriety of 
the following options: 

1.  Releasing the CORE from the deployment into a non-duty, non-pay status; 

2.  Releasing the CORE and returning him or her to the official duty station, or  

3.  Keeping the CORE deployed pending completion of any needed 

investigation or issuance of disciplinary action. 

C.  If the supervisor of record and FCO disagree whether to demobilize the 

CORE, the issue will be resolved by the Associate Administrator of Response 
and Recovery. 

11-5.  Arrest, Indictment, and other Allegations of Misconduct 

A.  FEMA may receive information that a CORE has been arrested, indicted for a 

crime, used an illegal drug, or has allegedly committed other serious 
misconduct. Supervisors may learn of this information in a variety of ways, 
including the CORE’s self-report or via other employees, the Office of the 
Chief Security Office (OCSO), or press reports. Upon receipt of such 
information, the supervisor of record, FCO, or temporary duty supervisor shall 
contact Employee Relations for guidance. 

B.  If the CORE is incarcerated or otherwise unable to come to work, the 

supervisor must first address the leave status. COREs may use available 
leave, if requested and approved by the supervisor. If the request is denied, 
the CORE shall be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status. The supervisor is 
not obligated to approve a leave request submitted by the CORE. 

64 

 
 
 
C.  If the CORE is available for duty following arrest, or, if not arrested, but is 
under investigation for alleged misconduct, the following factors must be 
considered in determining whether the CORE shall be permitted to return to 
duty pending resolution of the criminal action or other serious misconduct: 

1.  If the CORE has a security clearance, OCSO, Personnel Security Division 

(PSD), may suspend a CORE’s security clearance upon receipt of 
adverse information, such as an arrest or indictment. If PSD suspends the 
CORE’s clearance, or revokes it, PSD shall notify ER. Normally, COREs 
would be placed in non-duty, non-pay status until a recommendation on 
removal can be made by ER to the supervisor of record. 

2.  For COREs without security clearances, OCSO must determine if the 

CORE is fit for continued employment. Thus, until OCSO has rendered a 
determination on the CORE’s fitness, the supervisor of record must 
determine whether the CORE should be allowed to continue to work 
(including telework), be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status or be 
terminated pending the outcome of the criminal case, considering the 
following factors after consultation with ER, OCC’s Personnel Law Branch, 
and OCSO: 

i.  What is the nature of the offense or other serious misconduct? The 
more serious the offense, the more likely that the CORE should not 
return to duty. 

ii.  What evidence is there as to the commission of the offense? The lack 
of corroboration or confession especially with a minor offense, may 
weigh in favor of the CORE’s retention on duty. 

iii.  Does the known evidence suggest that the CORE is a physical or 

logical security risk? 

iv.  Impact on the Mission: Are there other factors that indicate that the 

mission will be adversely affected if the CORE is returned to duty, such 
as notoriety? Is the offense known, causing perceived damage to a 
Directorate’s, Office’s, or JFO’s ability to conduct business or its 
credibility due to the CORE’s continued presence? 

3.  Authority to return the CORE to duty pending resolution of criminal 

matters: After consultation with ER, and subject to approval, if required, by 
the Office of Inspector General: 

i.  For COREs who are deployed, the FCO shall make the final decision 
as to whether the CORE shall remain at the JFO, after consultation 
with the supervisor of record (see section 11-4 for resolution of 
disputes on this matter between FCO and the supervisor of record). 

ii.  For COREs at their official duty station, the supervisor of record shall 
make the final decision as to whether the CORE shall return to duty. 

65 

 
 
11-6.  The Appeal Process 

A CORE who wishes to appeal a reprimand, suspension, or removal decision 
may do so in writing to his or her second level supervisor no later than 5:00 p.m. 
(the local time of the second level supervisor) on the fifth calendar day following 
the effective date of the disciplinary action. COREs included within collective 
bargaining units must follow the procedures for that unit. Oral appeals are not 
permitted. This appeal process is not applicable to non-disciplinary actions, such 
as right-sizing, demobilization, or the expiration of appointments. 

A.  The CORE may provide a narrative and any documentation that he or she 

considers relevant for the second level supervisor to consider prior to issuing 
his or her final decision. 

B.  The second level supervisor may gather additional documents that he or she 
deems necessary to make a final decision. The second level supervisor 
should complete any additional investigation within five working days of the 
receipt of a timely appeal and issue a decision within five working days after 
finishing an investigation. 

C.  The Employee Relations Specialist will review the written decision drafted by 
the second level supervisor prior to its issuance to the CORE. Additionally, 
the Employee Relations Specialist will gather and preserve any and all 
additional documents acquired by the second level supervisor to issue the 
final decision and the final decision itself. 

11-7.  Allegations of Discrimination 

If a CORE alleges discrimination to his or her supervisor, the CORE must be 
referred to the Office of Equal Rights for appropriate guidance on the EEO 
complaint process. The supervisor may contact the Office of Chief Counsel’s 
Personnel Law Branch with any questions concerning the EEO process. 

11-8.  Allegations of Fraud, Waste, Abuse, and Mismanagement 

Supervisors must not ignore allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, or 
mismanagement, and must take steps to inquire into the allegations or refer them 
to appropriate management officials for investigation. Allegations of misconduct 
against COREs at the IC-15 or equivalent level or higher must be referred to the 
Office of Inspector General (ref: DHS Management Directive 0810.1) for 
investigation. 

66 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 12:  RIGHTSIZING 

12-1.  General 

A.  COREs receive temporary appointments that do not confer eligibility or 

priority consideration for permanent appointment. They may be removed from 
Federal service at any time for poor performance, misconduct, reduction in 
work, or for other agency mission needs, so long as adequate documentation 
exists to justify the removal, and are not subject to protection afforded by 
reduction-in-force provisions or reemployment rights established under any 
statutory or regulatory provision.  

B.  When FEMA requires reductions in staff levels in one or more functional 

areas due to a lack of work or funding, FEMA may conduct a rightsizing of its 
CORE workforce. A rightsizing may occur when an Office or Directorate 
anticipates needing fewer positions through the annual workload analysis and 
staffing plan process, or if an immediate need to reduce positions or workload 
is realized between annual workload analyses. 

C.  Rightsizing results in termination of appointment prior to the expiration date of 
an appointment, unless the CORE is selected for or is reassigned to another 
vacant position in FEMA. 

D.  Rightsizing procedures should not be used to remove CORE employees due 

to poor performance or misconduct.  

E.  A Rightsizing does not occur when FEMA declines to renew a CORE’s 

appointment at the end of a CORE’s appointment term. 

F.  Program Areas shall be clearly defined, with appropriate justification, in the 

Plan. The Plan shall be in writing and approved by OCCHCO prior to 
implementation.  

12-2.  Rightsizing Plan 

A.  The second level supervisor, in coordination with OCCHCO, develops a 

Rightsizing Plan to affect the rightsizing procedures described in this Chapter 
that will impact the COREs under his or her supervisory authority. The Plan 
shall be in writing and approved by OCCHCO prior to implementation. 

B.  Based on the Office or Directorate’s most recent workload analysis and 

staffing plan, the second level supervisor will identify the activities that will 
cease to be performed or require an adjustment in the amount of time for 
performance. 

C.  Using this adjusted workload analysis, the supervisor or manager will develop 
a revised Staffing Plan for the positions under his or her authority that will 
propose the number of CORE positions by title, series, grade, and duty 
station that will continue to be needed. The remaining positions will be 
identified for rightsizing. 

67 

 
 
D.  The Rightsizing Plan will consist of the updated staffing plan, any Functional 

Area SMEs identified for retention (see section 12-4.B.), the proposed 
timeline for providing the general and specific notices of rightsizing to the 
affected COREs, and the proposed effective date of the rightsizing. 

12-3.  Notice 

The second level supervisor will issue both general and specific notice of 
upcoming rightsizing efforts. 

A.  General Advance Notice. COREs will be given a 30 calendar day advance 
official notification concerning decisions which may result in their being 
affected by a rightsizing effort. This notification will be in writing and will 
include: the reasons for the rightsizing effort, such as lack of work or funds, 
reorganization, or a realignment of functions; and, whom to contact about 
assistance available for affected employees. 

B.   Specific Notice. Specific written notice of separation will be issued to 

individual affected COREs prior to the proposed date of their release.  
FEMA’s goal is to provide notice no less than 30 calendar days from their 
date of release unless extenuating circumstances dictate a shorter notice 
period.  

12-4.  Retention Criteria 

Upon determining that rightsizing procedures are required, the second level 
supervisor, in consultation with OCCHCO, shall utilize the following criteria to 
determine the order in which COREs will be released. An incumbent will only be 
compared to other incumbents under the supervision of that second level 
supervisor. 

A.  Position. Identify (1) the affected area; (2) the existing positions staffing that 
area; and (3) pay levels within each position. Each position is reviewed and 
listed by pay and location, and positions are identified for retention based on 
lack of work or funds, reorganization, or a realignment of functions. The 
determination as to the number of needed positions to staff the reduced 
workforce must be documented in the Rightsizing Plan. 

Example. In this example, the program area is identified as “Applicant 
Services” and the existing positions are “Applicant Services Specialists.” 
There are currently 10 IC-12s, 15 IC-11s, and 15 IC-9s Applicant Services 
Specialist positions. The remaining work only requires 3 IC-12s, 10 IC-11s, 
and no IC-9s Applicant Services Specialists.11 Therefore, 7 IC-12s, 5 IC-11s, 
and all IC-9s will be released. Consequently, the second level supervisor 
must examine the incumbent IC-12s and IC-11s to determine who will fill the 

11 For this example, substitute the pay band numbers for grade level if the COREs with positions 
targeted for rightsizing are paid via an administratively-determined pay scale utilizing pay bands. 

68 

 
 
 
                                                           
remaining positions utilizing the following retention criteria. OCCHCO must 
approve this Plan prior to implementation.

B.  Functional Area SME. To ensure accomplishment of mission objectives, the 
supervisor of a functional area subject to rightsizing procedures may identify 
one SME from the supervisor’s functional area that should be excluded from 
rightsizing procedures because of the SME’s subject matter expertise. Any 
request for a SME’s exclusion from rightsizing must be accompanied by a 
justification that establishes that a need exists for this SME position, and that 
the requested employee is most qualified for the SME position. This request 
must be approved by the supervisor’s chain of command with the final 
concurrence of the Head of the Office or Directorate, who will then inform 
OCCHCO of the SME designation and transmit to OCCHCO all documents 
justifying his or her selection. OCCHCO must review and approve the SME 
designation as part of the review of the Rightsizing Plan. A SME who is 
thereafter reassigned to a different functional area will lose his or her SME 
designation, thereby losing his or her exemption from rightsizing procedures. 

C.  Performance Evaluation. The second level supervisor will provide to 

OCCHCO the summary rating level of all COREs in positions that must be 
rightsized, based on their most recent annual performance appraisals. 
Incumbents will be released in inverse order of performance rating (lowest to 
highest). Normally, incumbents with summary rating levels of Achieved 
Excellence (or equivalent) will be excluded from release unless the total 
number of positions that must be released exceeds the number of incumbents 
who received a summary rating below Achieved Excellence (or equivalent).   

D.  Service Computation Date (SCD). If reviewing the performance evaluations 
of all COREs in positions that must be rightsized has not distinguished the 
incumbents for release from those who will be excluded from release for the 
current round of rightsizing, OCCHCO shall further review incumbents by 
SCD and shall identify those with the most recent SCDs for release.  

E.  Ties.  The official who would normally make the selection for the position from 

which the CORE is being released will determine, on the basis of 

69 

 
 
 
qualifications and competencies for the specific position, which employee(s) 
will be retained when two or more employees have identical service 
computation dates. The rationale for retention versus removal must be 
documented with the specific reasons for each decision. OCCHCO must 
review and approve the stated rationale. 

F.  Recovery Office Closure. 

1.  Some COREs will remain in their positions until the closure of the 

Recovery Office. 

2.  Upon the closure of the Recovery Office, the remaining COREs must have 

applied and been selected for a vacant FEMA position or they will be 
released from their employment with FEMA, using the notice procedures

12-5.  Transitional Options for Released COREs 

CORE staff identified for release will not be automatically reassigned directly into 
vacant positions elsewhere in FEMA and must apply and be appointed through 
the hiring procedures identified in this Manual. COREs will be released from their 
current appointments for lack of work if, by the date of their release, they have 
not been selected for another vacant position within FEMA. The Director of the 
Recovery Office or the Head of the Office or Directorate may assist COREs 
identified for release with career transition, as appropriate, by arranging for 
assistance with resume writing and interview preparation.

CHAPTER 13:  ABSENCE AND LEAVE 

13-1.  Absence and Leave Policy 

FEMA administratively applies FM 3300.3, FEMA Absence and Leave Policy to 
COREs, with the exception of CORE-Is, whose absence and leave policies are 
governed by FD 010-7, Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT) Program 
Directive.

CHAPTER 14:  TRAINING AND ETHICS 

14-1.  Training Provisions 

A.  The CORE and his or her supervisor of record share the responsibility for 

ensuring the CORE’s professional development. 

B.  OCCHCO, Employee Development Division, is responsible for drafting 

guidance on various topics, including but not limited to, continuing service 
agreements relating participation in employee development programs, 
supervisory training, and individual and executive development plans. 

C.  A CORE may be temporarily placed on a rotational assignment as part of a 
professional development program. In such circumstances, the duties and 
responsibilities performed by the CORE must be authorized under the 
Stafford Act. A CORE may be placed on a rotational assignment for up to 120 
days that may be renewed for one additional 120 day period. As the CORE 
IMAT program maintains its own professional development program, CORE 
IMATs are not eligible for rotational assignments. 

D.  Eligibility for training programs for a CORE paid via the grades and steps 

system is determined by the applicable grade and years of service 
requirement. Eligibility for training programs for a CORE paid via the pay 
band system is determined by comparing the current salary level of the 
CORE to the salary range of the GS levels eligible for the training program 
and the years of service requirement. The CORE will be eligible for a training 
program if the CORE’s salary is within the salary range of the GS employees 
eligible for the training and satisfying the years of service requirement. 

E.  IM COREs are eligible to participate in applicable leadership development 
programs so long as the training program does not have an impact on 
mission requirements. If an IM CORE is directed to deploy during a training 
program the CORE must deploy and may not finish the training program. 

F.  COREs participating in a leadership development program will be required to 
sign and comply with the terms of a three year Continuing Service Agreement 
(CSA). See Chapter 15, Continuing Service Agreements, for more 
information. 

14-2.  Ethics Requirements  

A.  All COREs are subject to the federal ethics laws and regulations, including 

the criminal conflict of interest statutes, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Executive Branch, and any supplemental ethics regulations 
promulgated by DHS. 

1.  Federal ethics laws and regulations apply to COREs at all times and may 

affect a CORE’s ability to seek and enter into outside employment. 

2.  A CORE’s outside employment may also create a real or apparent conflict 

of interest with his or her FEMA duties. 

72 

 
 
3.  COREs must be informed of these rules and regulations prior to hiring. 

B.  All COREs shall receive training in fraud detection and prevention, equal 

rights, privacy, and security. 

C.  All COREs must complete Initial Ethics Orientation provided by OCC Ethics 

within 90 days of their date of entry, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 2638.703. 

D.  Confidential financial disclosure filers must complete one hour of annual 

ethics training per calendar year, as required by 5 C.F.R. § 2638.705.  All 
other COREs must complete annual ethics training per FEMA policy. 

E.  All annual ethics training is provided by OCC Ethics.

CHAPTER 15:  CONTINUING SERVICE AGREEMENTS 

15-1.  Service Agreement 

A.  An applicant or CORE who receives a recruitment, relocation, or retention 

incentive is required to sign a two-year CSA prior to receiving the incentive. 
The Selecting Official or supervisor of record will preserve a signed copy of 
the service agreement and transmit a copy to OCCHCO. 

B.  A CORE participating in a leadership development program will be required to 

sign a three-year CSA. 

C.  A CORE must fulfill the terms of the CSA, including when the appointment is 

renewed for another appointment period. 

15-2.  Terminations of a CSA 

A.  If a CORE voluntarily separates from FEMA prior to completing the service 
obligation period, to begin employment with DHS Headquarters or another 
DHS Component, the CORE must give his or her supervisor of record at least 
30 days advance notice in writing, during which time the supervisor shall 
notify OCCHCO to transfer the remaining service obligation to the gaining 
agency. If the CORE separates from the Federal service or begins 
employment with another Federal agency, the CORE will be indebted to 
FEMA for the remaining service period. 

B.  A CORE who is demoted, removed from Federal service for misconduct or 
poor performance, or receives a rating of record lower than Achieved 
Expectations or equivalent, before fulfilling the terms of a CSA will be 
indebted to the Federal Government for the remaining service period.  

C.  Repayment is not required when a CORE is involuntarily separated for 
reasons other than misconduct or poor performance, or when the 
circumstances are otherwise beyond the CORE’s control. 

D.  A CSA may be unilaterally terminated by the head of an Office or Directorate 
based solely on management needs. Examples of discretionary removals 
include, but are not limited to, rightsizings or insufficient funds to continue 
planned payments. When a removal is based on management needs, the 
employee is entitled to all payments attributable to completed service and to 
retain any portion of a payment received that is attributable to uncompleted 
service. 

15-3.  Debt Recovery 

A.  When reimbursement is required, the repayment amount will be reduced on a 

pro rata basis for the percentage of completion of the obligated service 
period. 

B.  If a CORE’s appointment is not renewed, and the CORE is not appointed to a 

different position within FEMA, recovery is waived. 

74 

 
 
 
C.  An indebted CORE may request a waiver of any debt relating to a CSA to his 
or her Office or Directorate head. The Officer or Directorate head must send 
the request along with his or her recommendation through OCCHCO to the 
Administrator, who will render a written decision. Waivers in whole or in part 
will be rare and will be based on a determination that the recovery would be 
against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest.
