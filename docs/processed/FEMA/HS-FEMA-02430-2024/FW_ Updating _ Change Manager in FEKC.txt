Subject: Updating / Change Manager in FEKC

Hello Recovery Supervisors,

  A big thanks to PA and Kathy Canaday for helping to point this out. To keep a better record of training in FEKC going forward, please do the following to
ensure your current Supervisor is your Manager in FEKC. This will allow Supervisors to keep track and make sure you don’t miss anything on training.

Once you open FEKC you should see your initials in the top right of the screen. From the drop down select account, under profile you should see Work
Information. Scroll to the bottom and select Edit Work Information, the pop-up box below should then come up and click Select Manager. Search for
your Supervisors name and then add. If you open it and your Supervisor is already listed then no need to update. Once complete click Save and exit out
of the pop-up box.

After you do that, you can copy and paste this message and make a few adjustments to send to your staff and have them select you as the primary
manager. For those who have Supervisors under you, make sure they follow this as well.  This will allow us to manage this better going forward, so we
meet our requirements and goals.

With the last upgrade for FEKC, they added a lot of reports, which allow managers to run various reports on training as well. If I missed any Supervisors
on the “To” line, please forward to them. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For IRC Branch, Arsany is your Supervisor until the Branch Chief is hired.

Thank you,
