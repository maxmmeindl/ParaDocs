CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) workforce has one central goal – to 
ensure the Agency builds, sustains, and continuously improves upon its capability to prepare for, 
protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. During an incident, the 
Agency’s entire workforce supports this goal, despite their job series, grade, or employee type. 
To achieve this goal successfully, FEMA trains, qualifies, equips, and evaluates its workforce to 
provide rapid, expeditionary support to fulfill statutory requirements. The incident workforce is 
committed to FEMA’s core values of compassion, fairness, integrity, and respect as outlined in 
FEMA Publication 1.  

FEMA actively engages in programs and partnerships to manage, enhance, augment, support, 
and deploy the Agency’s workforce. Overall management of the workforce requires an agency-
wide collaborative approach and clear definitions of roles and responsibilities to ensure that 
FEMA is able to meet its statutory requirements. 

To ensure an effective and organized incident response, the workforce is categorized into four 
categories: 

• 

• 

Incident Management – positions at the incident level that support the Initial Operating 
Facility, Joint Field Office (JFO), Area Field Office, or other locations 
Incident Support – positions during incident operations at the regional or national level in 
either the Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC) or the National Response 
Coordination Center (NRCC) 

•  Ancillary Support – positions that, in both their steady-state and/or incident roles, support 

the NRCC and/or RRCC and incident field offices 

•  Mission Essential – positions at headquarters, the regional offices, and other designated 

offices that must be filled to maintain basic Agency operations (e.g., payroll, information 
technology, and maintenance). Mission essential functions must always be performed, 
but may require less than the full complement of staff at any one time. As a result, 
holding a mission essential function may not exclude an employee from deployment. The 
Emergency Relocation Group is part of mission essential. Emergency Relocation Group 
personnel report to a pre-selected continuity site to perform essential functions or other 
tasks related to continuity operations 

Because of what FEMA asks of its incident workforce, and what they will experience conducting 
response and recovery operations, it is imperative that they are fully supported in gaining and 
maintaining optimum operational readiness. Operational readiness is how FEMA works to 
prepare their incident workforce for an activation and deployment. Readiness is achieved 
through a constant cycle of planning, equipping, training, exercising, monitoring, and evaluating 
to ensure the workforce is ready at a moment’s notice. At FEMA, this is accomplished through 
sound cadre management. FEMA’s incident workforce cadres are the initial operational

mechanism essential to maintain a supporting presence to both satisfy the Agency’s statutory 
requirements and honor its national commitments. As such, a standardized, agency-wide cadre 
management system is vital. 

Authorities and Foundational Documents 

•  Section 503(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296 as amended

Purpose and Scope 
The purpose of this guide is to describe the composition, governance, and principles of the 
FEMA cadre management system. It is specifically designed for FEMA Cadre Coordinators and 
their subordinate staff. It will expand upon the responsibilities outlined in the Cadre Management 
Directive, outlining resources, providing required information, and explaining processes and 
procedures to successfully manage an operational incident workforce cadre. The scope of this 
guide is limited to incident management positions.

CHAPTER 2: THE FEMA CADRE MANAGEMENT 
FRAMEWORK 

FEMA’s cadre management framework is designed to effectively maintain a cadre’s operational 
readiness on both the individual and collective level. Effective cadre management equates to 
optimum operational readiness allowing the Agency to satisfy its requirements in the mitigation, 
response, and recovery mission areas. 

FEMA’s vision of a ready workforce is one that is adequately staffed, available, trained, 
qualified, and equipped to conduct its mission and is continuously monitored on performance to 
ensure accountability in mission accomplishment and facilitate constant improvement. The cadre 
management framework detailed in this chapter provides organizational mechanisms for cadre 
management, oversight, and support. The framework underscores the importance that each 
individual employee increases our readiness and facilitates the execution of FEMA’s missions. 

FEMA Cadres 
A cadre is defined as a group of FEMA full-time equivalent (FTE) and intermittent (Reservist) 
employees organized by operational or programmatic functions and are assigned incident 
management FEMA Qualification System (FQS) positions (either primary or subordinate) that 
perform incident-related duties during FEMA incident operations. Cadres are grouped 
organizationally by program area within corresponding directorates and offices throughout the 
Agency. A cadre is the operational mechanism the Agency maintains to effectively deliver 
FEMA programs in support of our National Preparedness Goal. These cadres are composed of 
two types of FEMA employees hired under Title V and the Stafford Act hiring authorities. 

Title V Employees (5 U.S. Code) 
Employees hired under 5 U.S. Code, or Title V, make up FEMA’s permanent workforce, which 
is responsible for achieving the Agency’s mission and administering programs in the 
headquarters and regional offices. In keeping with the concept outlined in the January 20, 2012, 
memorandum from the Deputy Administrator, “Every Employee is an Emergency Manager,” 
and consistent with the FEMA Force structure implementation, FEMA qualifies Title V 
employees to fill incident roles. By utilizing their varied incident experience, the Agency is able 
to enhance its ability to respond to, recover from, and mitigate all types of incidents. 

Title V employees are eligible to hold positions in any of the FEMA incident categories (incident 
management, incident support, ancillary support, and mission essential). These employees are 
compensated out of FEMA’s operating budget and not the Stafford Act.

. 

FEMA is composed of the Title V categories listed below: 

•  Permanent Full Time (PFT) 
•  Temporary Full Time (TFT) 

Stafford Act Employee 
The Stafford Act gives FEMA the authority to establish a temporary workforce that is not subject 
to Title V hiring in support of incidents.1 These employees must provide support to Stafford Act 
activities. These employees are a major component of FEMA’s incident workforce at 
headquarters, regional offices, and incident-level facilities to respond effectively and rapidly to 
deliver assistance essential to disaster survivors. 

Stafford Act employees include those in the following categories: 

Incident Management (IM) CORE 

•  Cadre of On-call Response Employees (CORE) 
• 
•  Reservist 
•  Local Hire 

Cadre of On-call Response Employees 

COREs are full-time employees that support Stafford Act activities. They can be deployed to 
fulfill any role specifically related to the incident for which they were hired. 

Incident Management CORE 

IM COREs are Stafford Act COREs whose primary job is to perform an FQS incident 
management position. FEMA IM COREs are deployed to the greatest extent possible. 

Reservists 

Reservists work on an intermittent basis and are deployed as needed to fulfill incident 
management roles within their cadre function. This can include interviewing disaster survivors; 
conducting and verifying damage assessments; providing administrative, financial, and logistical 
support; and performing a wide variety of other tasks as identified by staffing needs and 
operational requirements.2 

1 “In performing any services under this act, any Federal agency is authorized to appoint and fix the compensation of 
such temporary personnel as may be necessary, without regard to the provisions of Title V governing appointments 
in competitive service.” – Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Section 306 (b) (Public 
Law 93-288, 108 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5149)

Cadre Management 
Cadre management is the effective administration, coordination, and professional development 
of a FEMA Cadre ensuring the individual and collective operational readiness to perform 
incident-related duties. 

The primary function of cadre management is to ensure optimum operational readiness. Inherent 
in maintaining optimum operational readiness for a FEMA cadre involves five operating 
principles – Staffing Force Structure; Educating and Training Cadre Members; Qualifying Cadre 
Members; Equipping Cadre Members; and Performance Management. These principles are 
equally critical to the collective operational readiness of teams and to the individual cadre 
member. 

Each incident workforce cadre will establish and maintain a management structure, based on 
cadre size, employee composition, and other extenuating factors deemed necessary through 
human capital staffing analysis, to effectively perform cadre management functions and maintain 
optimum operational readiness. At a minimum, a cadre’s workforce structure will consist of a 
Certifying Authority (CA), Certifying Official (CO), and Cadre Coordinator, which make up the 
cadre leadership. To ensure an effective and efficient management structure, cadre leadership 
will tailor their structure based on administrative needs, complexity of the incident mission, and 
training requirements. This can include a Cadre Training Manager, Reservist Program Manager 
(RPM), FTE Coordinator, IM CORE Program Manager, Assistant RPMs, and FTE Specialists as 
required. Assistant RPMs and FTE Specialists, when needed, support the RPM and FTE 
Coordinator respectively. When these positions are filled, they are full-time responsibilities. For 
cadres who do not warrant additional personnel beyond the CA, CO, and Cadre Coordinator, 
these responsibilities will be shared amongst existing cadre management personnel. Table 1 
outlines the required and potential positions for each incident workforce cadre.

A CA serves as the highest-ranking FEMA official —Assistant 
Administrator equivalent or higher— for each of the incident workforce 
cadres. 
A CO is designated by the CA to manage FQS for a specific incident 
workforce cadre. 
A Cadre Coordinator manages each incident workforce cadre. This 
individual has delegated authority from the CA and CO to oversee all 
aspects of day-to-day cadre management including staffing, equipping, 
training, qualifying, and performance of the cadre and its members. 
A Cadre Training Manager reports to the Cadre Coordinator, serves as 
the cadre’s primary point of contact for the development and delivery of 
all FQS related training, and oversees the prioritization of all training 
within the cadre. 
An RPM reports to the Cadre Coordinator and serves as the supervisor 
of record for the cadre’s Reservist population. Assistant RPMs may also 
be assigned based on the size of the cadre’s Reservist force structure 
in accordance with established Agency hiring procedures. 
An FTE Coordinator reports to the Cadre Coordinator and facilitates 
cadre requirements for headquarters’ FTE cadre members and their 
supervisors of record, and coordinates regional FTE requirements with 
Regional Incident Workforce Management (IWM) Liaison Teams. This 
position may also serve as the IM CORE Program Manager for smaller 
cadres. FTE Program Specialists may be assigned based on the size of 
the cadre’s FTE force structure. 
An IM CORE Program Manager reports to the Cadre Coordinator and 
serves as the supervisor of record for IM CORE cadre members. 
Assistant IM CORE Program Managers may be assigned based on the 
size of the cadre’s IM CORE force structure. The position of IM CORE 
Program Manager may be staffed by an IM CORE within the cadre for up 
to a two-year appointment. This is particularly important for IM CORE 
positions that have a required deployment threshold of 300 days per 
year. 

Figure 1 identifies the cadre management structure. It is a standardized, scalable structure that is 
used to manage each FEMA cadre. Cadre management will be a centrally controlled, but de-
centrally managed function. Cadre management personnel do not need to be located at 
headquarters. In this guide, actions for cadre management refer to the positions in table 1.

FEMA regions will institute a Regional IWM Liaison Team in lieu of the former IWMD Liaison. 
Each FEMA region is required to maintain a Regional IWM Liaison Team to support regional 
readiness through implementation and maintenance of incident workforce initiatives for regional 
incident operations. 

The Regional IWM Liaison Team reports to the Regional Administrator (RA) or his/her delegate 
and supports implementation and maintenance of incident workforce initiatives in regional 
incident operations. The team maintains incident workforce subject matter expertise, provides 
assistance to regional staff, facilitates monitoring of regional incident workforce readiness, and 
supports regional implementation of FQS.

Cadre Management Oversight 
Two bodies provide general oversight to ensure effective and appropriate standardization in 
cadre management. The senior body is the IWESC. The IWESC provides executive oversight for 
the development, maintenance, and revision of all policy and doctrine for FEMA’s incident 
workforce. The second body is the Cadre Coordinators Working Group (CCWG), an action-
oriented working group that raises policy-level issues and recommendations to the IWESC for 
decision, and supports the IWESC through the operationalization of their executive decisions.  

Incident Workforce Executive Steering Committee 
The IWESC is a group that meets at least twice per year to make policy, doctrine, and other 
pertinent decisions pertaining to the incident workforce. The IWESC is necessary to integrate 
stakeholder input from across the Agency. The IWESC establishes the framework, prioritizes 
criteria for, and resolves conflicts related to budgeting for the incident workforce; and maintains 
oversight of the CCWG. Table 2 depicts the IWESC structure.

Cadre Coordinators Working Group 
The CCWG is a group chaired and coordinated by the Director of IWMD, and consists of all 
designated Cadre Coordinators and Regional IWM Liaison Teams. The CCWG supports the 
development, implementation, and maintenance of incident workforce initiatives; discusses and 
addresses challenges associated with staffing, equipping, training, qualifying, and managing the 
performance of the incident workforce; and develops consistent processes for recruiting and 
appointing new members into cadre vacancies. 

While the CCWG is not a decision-making body, it is a critical action arm of the IWESC as 
discussions in the group can identify policy-level issues to be raised to the IWESC for resolution. 
The CCWG will meet as required but at least twice per year in coordination with the IWESC 
meetings. 

Table 3 depicts the CCWG structure. 

3 Two RA representatives will be appointed in writing by the Director of Disaster Operations (DDO) for a term of 
two years. These two positions will rotate among RAs and will be staggered, so only one RA representative changes 
each year.
4 This position will be nominated by the CCWG as a representative for the working group to be confirmed by the 
DDO and rotates on an annual basis.

Cadre Management Support 
The following organizations maintain key responsibilities in supporting the Agency’s operational 
cadres and should be considered critical components of FEMA’s Cadre Management 
Framework. 

Incident Workforce Management Division 
The IWMD supports FEMA’s operational cadres through the management and administration of 
the FQS, maintaining the Agency’s force structure, coordinating and executing deployments, and 
providing critical data and information on cadre readiness.

CHAPTER 3: STAFFING FORCE STRUCTURE 

This chapter discusses the role of cadre management in staffing force structure and provides the 
Cadre Coordinator with information on the steps required to staff force structure. It will provide 
background information on the Agency’s force structure model, as well as discuss the 
requirements of availability, and outline available support to the cadres as they navigate the 
processes and procedures. 

Principles of FEMA’s Force Structure Model 
The FEMA force structure is a model that establishes incident personnel staffing requirements. 
The force structure model establishes the staffing requirements that enable FEMA to support 
State, local, tribal, and territorial, (SLTT) governments during simultaneous events. The FEMA 
Incident Management and Support Keystone defines three levels of disasters: Level I, II, and III, 
with Level I being the most severe, and Level III the least. The force structure model modifies 
these levels by dividing Level I into two levels for more accurate planning. The FEMA incident 
workforce levels are: Catastrophic Level I, Level I, Level II, and Level III. These force structure 
levels guide the identification of appropriate FEMA incident workforce staffing required to 
adequately respond to potential or actual incidents. When generating the force structure data, it is 
assumed that the FEMA incident workforce structure requires the ability to respond to the 
following: 

three Level I events; two of which are concurrent 

•  one catastrophic event 
• 
•  28 Level II events; 20 of which are concurrent 
•  70 Level III events with the capability to support 30 Level III teams 

The development of force structure requires a comprehensive analysis of the workforce, 
organized by FQS job title. This workforce analysis looks at what positions are required for 
FEMA to conduct its response, recovery, and mitigation missions. This analysis is based on a 
thorough mission analysis, which delineates the essential tasks of each position within each 
cadre. It incorporates a review of historic and current incident workforce data and considers the 
impact of technological advances, improvements in FEMA’s qualification systems, and the 
impact of mitigation efforts. 

The IWESC will determine policy and criteria for establishing and updating FEMA’s incident 
force structure. The CCWG establishes procedures in support of this policy which include 
mechanisms to ensure consideration of force structure recommendations from programs, cadres, 
and regions. IWMD, on behalf of the Director of Disaster Operations (DDO), coordinates the 
day-to-day implementation of force structure policy and procedures.

. 

The force structure model is reevaluated not less than every three years as outlined in FD010-6. 
This reevaluation includes a comprehensive examination of historic and current force structure 
data, FTE deployment patterns, redevelopment and reorganization of force packages and cadre 
force structure by FQS position, as required. A number of FEMA offices participate in and 
support this review, to include Office of Policy and Program Analysis (OPPA), Office of the 
Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Mission Support, and Regional Leadership. Cadre leadership 
should continually assess operational requirements in the field to recommend modifications to 
FEMA force structure and related policies and procedures to IWMD. 

Staffing a Cadre 
Staffing a cadre is a shared effort between various organizations and supporting personnel within 
FEMA. The roles and responsibilities of these varying organizations and supporting personnel 
are delineated in table 4. Although this activity is a shared effort, ensuring effective and optimal 
staffing of a cadre is the responsibility of the Cadre Coordinator. 

IWMD distributes to cadre personnel bi-weekly the force structure vs. actuals report (FS vs. 
actuals as table 5 shows). This report enables the reader to determine if there is force structure 
availability within an FQS job title, as well as within a specific employee type. 

Force Structure versus Actuals Report 
Table 5 is an illustrative example of a force structure versus actuals report. The table shows 
staffing of the positions against a specific FQS job title is reflected by employee type (Reservist, 
IM CORE, or FTE) and by cumulative position force strength. “ADAD FQS Identifier,” within 
the ADR Cadre, reflects when fully staffed at optimal levels, there are 40 Reservists (“RSV FS”). 
However, the number in the “RSV Actual 4/14/14” column demonstrates only 32 Reservists are 
currently holding the position title. Therefore, the cadre needs 8 people, which is shown in the 
“RSV Left to Fill” column, to be at force strength for Reservists in this position. The following is 
a description of the column titles for each employee type: 

•  RSV FS/IM CORE FS/FTE FS: The total number of positions allocated to an FQS job 
title, based upon employee type (i.e. RSV, IM CORE, or FTE). This is the cadre’s force 
structure for a specific position per employee type. 

•  RSV Actual/IM CORE Actual/FTE Actual (Date): Data from the IWMD Deployment 
Branch and the National Finance Center is used to determine the number of persons 
actually holding the FQS job title as of the date the report was run. This is the cadre’s 
force strength for a specific position.  

•  RSV Left to Fill/IM CORE Left to Fill/FTE Left to Fill: The difference between the 
force structure and actuals results in a number of positions that are “left to fill”. These 
positions are available to be staffed by the cadre. 

•  Total FEMA Workforce: This is the total force structure for the cadre when fully 

staffed. A Cadre Coordinator may staff a force structure vacancy.

Filling Vacant Force Structure Positions 
When a vacancy in force structure has been identified, the Cadre Coordinator is responsible for 
filling the force structure vacancy. Table 5 describes the process by which an individual, 
depending upon employee type, is hired into the Agency and is able to achieve initial FQS 
qualifications. 

Intrinsic to the concept of “Every Employee is an Emergency Manager,” is that every FEMA 
employee will be trained and qualified to respond to an incident. To bring this initiative into 
fruition, there must be an impetus on the cadre level to recruit employees to get FQS qualified in 
their respective cadres. Not only will this help readiness on a cadre level, but also will aid the 
entire Agency’s goal of maintaining a robust, qualified workforce. 

Recruitment to a cadre can take many forms: from organizational events such as FQS Job Fairs 
down to the individual recruitment level. Cadre leadership are encouraged to coordinate with 
Regional IWM Liaison Teams and FTEs who do not have an FQS position to help achieve 
FEMA’s overarching goals, as well as striving toward achieving optimal cadre readiness levels.

Interagency Augmentation to a Cadre’s Force Structure 
FEMA also utilizes other personnel resources that are not FEMA employees to supplement the 
incident workforce. These include FEMA Corps members and volunteers from other Federal 
agencies that are part of the SCF. Supplemental workforce personnel hold FQS position titles, 
but do not count toward a Cadre’s force structure. 

Cadre Coordinators are responsible for coordinating with the IWMD FEMA Corps Unit and with 
the IWMD SCF to ensure they understand the support that can be provided by these programs 
and are prepared to facilitate coordination for their support during disaster operations. While 
these entities augment the incident workforce, they do not count against a cadre’s force structure. 

FEMA Corps 

FEMA Corps is a FEMA-funded component within the AmeriCorps National Civilian 
Community Corps (NCCC). While FEMA Corps is not deployed through FEMA’s deployment 
system, its members must provide updated information on location, activities, etc., and update 
the system for tracking and accountability purposes. Traditionally, FEMA Corps teams are 
required to check-in with the Deployment Unit within seventy two hours after receipt of an 
emergency deployment notice or pursuant to the timeline requested for less urgent assignments. 

At the start of their appointment, FEMA Corps members complete approximately one month of 
NCCC based training, one week of FEMA training, and two weeks of FQS-specific training. 
Excluding team leaders, FEMA Corps members may be issued a PTB for their FQS position, but 
they are not counted against force structure numbers. FEMA Corps teams can be comprised of 
one or mixed FQS positions. FEMA Corps members are pre-funded response workforce assets 
that can be requested by regions, field offices, program areas, or cadre leadership to complete 
any Stafford Act authorized work. 

Surge Capacity Force 

The SCF is comprised of volunteers from non-FEMA DHS components and other Federal 
agencies who receive just-in-time training to support, but are not limited to, the following FEMA 
program areas: logistics, DSA, Individual Assistance, and Public Assistance. In an effort to 
increase enrollment across DHS and other Federal agencies, cadre leadership with SCF 
opportunities are encouraged to support recruitment efforts of any permanent full or part-time 
Federal employee, who is not credentialed in any disaster specific skill, and offer education 
and/or guidance about joining FEMA in a SCF role. To the greatest extent possible, FEMA SCF 
staff use the job series of each volunteer in order to assign them to missions in their area of 
expertise based on the needs of the FCO/FDRC and operational requirements. 

Availability 
“Available” is the status of a FEMA incident workforce member who can readily deploy in 
support of an incident in either an incident management or incident support role. If on leave, an

employee must ensure his or her availability status is updated in the deployment tracking system. 
Upon receipt of the notification to deploy, personnel may be unable to deploy for their assigned 
incident position for a variety of reasons (e.g., approved annual or sick leave, Leave Without 
Pay, Family Medical Leave Act, etc.). Employees are responsible for ensuring their availability 
status and accurate contact information is maintained and up-to-date in FEMA’s deployment 
tracking system, and that availability status is approved by the supervisor of record. 

Supervisors of record, in coordination with their employees who are members of the incident 
workforce, are responsible for monitoring and ensuring their individual availability is reported in 
accordance with FD010-8, FEMA Incident Workforce Deployment, Section VII.B or 
superseding policy. Cadre Coordinators or RPMs, if applicable, are the supervisors of record for 
their Reservist cadre members and are responsible for monitoring the availability status of all 
categories of employees that constitute the cadre. Each type of employee has requirements that 
govern their required amount of availability. Table 6 lists these responsibilities.

•  Must be available except if on Pre-Approved Non-Availability (PANA) or 

other approved leave per FD010-6 

•  Must coordinate with supervisor of record and update the deployment 

system if unavailable for deployment 

Special Considerations for Managing Availability 
Pre-Approved Non-Availability (PANA) 

Reservists may take up to 60 days per calendar year of PANA when not deployed. Unexpended 
PANA may not be carried over from one calendar year to a subsequent calendar year. PANA 
may be used for any purpose and Reservists shall request PANA in writing from their Cadre 
Coordinators. Cadre Coordinators shall grant PANA for periods of not fewer than 15 days per 
request, and may not approve leave requests made in response to an activation request. When on 
PANA, a Reservist is not available to deploy on demand and the IWMD will not place them in 
rotation for deployment. 

Workers’ Compensation for Deployed Employees 

A FEMA employee who sustains an injury or illness while in the performance of duty may be 
eligible for benefits under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. Once an incident occurs, 
it is imperative that the employee notifies his/her temporary duty supervisor, supervisor of 
record, and the Safety Officer from the Safety, Health, and Medical Readiness Division and

completes the requisite forms found at: 
http://on.fema.net/components/msb/OCCHCO/es/Pages/WrkCmp.aspx. 

Employees injured on the job are responsible for keeping the Agency informed of any changes to 
their medical condition. Fully recovered or partially disabled employees who have debilitating 
medical conditions as the result of on-the-job injuries are obligated to seek suitable employment 
and accept suitable offers of employment when medically feasible.  The Agency has an 
obligation to restore an employee injured on the job to his/her former position or a comparable 
position.  

An employee in a worker’s compensation status will be marked “not available” in the 
deployment system; once cleared for deployment, their status will be updated to “available.” 
Once ready to return, the employee will be offered the opportunity to return to work in a 
comparable role if there is a staffing need for the FQS position he/she holds. The Cadre 
Coordinator, in coordination with the Agency’s Workers’ Compensation Program, will be 
responsible for reintegrating the employee into the workforce in an appropriate capacity 
(light/alternate duty or regular duty). In the case of a Reservist, the Cadre Coordinator may need 
to assist in the creation of a position to satisfy the minimum return time of 90 days for a 
temporary, intermittent employee. 

Declinations 

Per FD010-8, all FTE employees listed as available within the Deployment System may be 
deployed without further supervisory approval. IWMD will regularly report declination trends of 
FEMA HQ component and Regional Offices to FEMA senior leadership. FTE employees who 
wish to have a declination deemed a “reasonable cause declination” must submit a narrative 
explanation to the appropriate CO and CA for adjudication. Cadre Coordinators should monitor 
FTE declinations and, in coordination with the employee’s supervisor of record, the regional 
IWM Liaison Team, the CO, and CA decertify or reclassify the employee as mission essential, 
incident support, or ancillary support as applicable. 

If a Reservist declines three deployments within one calendar year while in “available” status, 
and without reasonable cause for doing so, the Cadre Coordinator shall direct OCCHCO to 
terminate the Reservist’s appointment. IWMD will document the declinations in the deployment 
system and maintain deployment records in accordance with applicable records retention 
policies. Cadre Coordinators and/or Reservist Program Managers should routinely run reports 
from the deployment system and thoroughly review reasons for declinations to check on the 
status of Reservists. Further guidance on what constitutes reasonable cause for an excused

declination can be found in the FD010-6 Reservist Program Directive and the FEMA 
Deployment Guide.5 

Remote Work 

FEMA has specific guidance for when employees may work from their residence of record or at 
an alternate location when on temporary duty. This guidance may include Reservists or IM 
COREs in specific situations. All employees who are deployed are on official travel, which is 
excluded from the definition of “telework” in the Telework Enhancement Act, OPM guidance 
and FEMA Manual 123-9-1 FEMA Telework Policy. Even though employees who are deployed 
are not considered to be teleworking, there are specific reasons an employee may be approved to 
work from an alternate location. Details related to when remote work is acceptable can be found 
in appendix A. 

Annuitants 

Annuitants are retirees from Federal service who are receiving a Federal retirement annuity 
(“annuitants”) and become reemployed by the Federal government. They differ from other 
incident employees because there are certain parameters that affect their pay. Annuitants will 
have their salaries reduced (“offset”) by the amount of the annuity they are entitled to receive 
during their period of reemployment. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has authority to waive annuity-offset requirements 
on a case-by-case basis. This salary offset can be waived individually by FEMA’s OCCHCO for 
the first 120 days of a Presidentially Declared Disaster. It is important to note that FEMA has not 
received the authority to apply this waiver to emergencies or for Other Duty Travel (e.g., 
training, exercises, meetings, course development). Waiver requests for employment exceeding 
the first 120 days of a Presidentially Declared Disaster must be forwarded to DHS for further 
transmittal to OPM per 5 U.S.C. § 8344(i).  

5 Reasonable cause for declining a deployment request includes, but is not limited to the following scenarios: An 
annuitant who receives a deployment to a specific incident site whose salary offset will not be waived at the time of 
deployment; a Reservist who submitted a timely request for approved leave to their Cadre Coordinator prior to the 
deployment request and whose request would have otherwise made them unavailable to deploy on the date of the 
deployment request; there is a spontaneous life event, as determined by the Cadre Coordinator, that qualifies for 
ERL and/or FMLA or receives military activation orders but was reasonably not able to notify their Cadre 
Coordinator of the life event or activation orders to obtain approved unavailability; a Reservist who has requested or 
is otherwise engaged in the reasonable accommodation process pursuant to Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973 and cannot deploy without that accommodation or whose previously-agreed upon accommodation prevents 
them from accepting the deployment request; a Reservist who has already declined one deployment on the date of 
the deployment request; a Reservist who has already received activation orders for a separate deployment; a 
Reservist has a jury summons; a Reservist who declines a deployment immediately subsequent to their

CHAPTER 4: EDUCATING AND TRAINING MEMBERS 
OF A CADRE 

As discussed in the previous chapter, staffing force structure is one of the most important 
responsibilities for cadre management. Once this critical step is complete, the cadre’s personnel 
must be set up for success in an incident environment. Cadre members must be afforded an 
effective continuum of education and training that effectively prepares them for the challenges 
they will face. They must have a solid foundation in FEMA programs and the Agency’s means 
of support, as well as an extensive working knowledge in their program area’s operations. Like 
staffing, these are shared efforts undertaken by a number of offices and organizations across the 
Agency as table 8 depicts. It is the responsibility of the Cadre Coordinator to ensure that the 
cadre’s training program is mission appropriate, effective, and successful. As Cadre Coordinators 
develop their training plans and programs, they must do so in the manner in which they intend to 
operate during a catastrophic incident. 

Accordingly, this chapter is designed to be a working reference for Cadre Coordinators and 
focuses on developing and administering education and training programs for their cadre to 
include required and mandatory training, elective training and professional development. The 
chapter also includes descriptions of the coordination functions that the Cadre Coordinators have 
with other FEMA offices responsible for varying segments of education, training, and 
professional development. Additional information regarding a systems approach to training can 
be found in appendix B.

Cadre Responsibilities in FQS 
FEMA must be the most prepared when our nation is least prepared to respond to, recover from, 
and mitigate a catastrophic man-made or natural disaster. Success in an incident demands that an 
organization be led by well-educated, trained, and competent leaders to ensure that their cadre is 
prepared through thorough training. Such training ranges from individual training and readiness, 
to comprehensive team training and exercises. The following section outlines the cadre 
responsibilities in FQS. 

Certifying Authority: The CA has delegated authority from the FEMA Administrator to certify 
that employees are qualified for FQS positions within that cadre. The CA may delegate FQS 
authority (in accordance with the FQS Guide) and cadre management authorities to the CO 
and/or Cadre Coordinator, but ultimately bears responsibility for the effective management and 
performance of the cadre, specifically:

•  Reviewing recommendations 
•  Approving or disapproving the recommendations beyond the authority delegated to the 

CO 

•  Signing supervisory certification documents (FQS transmittal log/FQS decision letter) for 

employee notification process 

•  Ensuring that employees receive communication on requests for certification within 60 

days 

Certifying Official: The CO is designated by the CA to manage the day-to-day operation of 
FQS for a specific incident workforce cadre, including having the authority from the CA to issue 
PTBs and certify individuals for specific FQS positions. The CO cannot delegate this authority. 

Cadre Coordinator: The Cadre Coordinator maintains the accuracy and currency of the cadre’s 
FQS elements in compliance with the FQS Guide or superseding doctrine. The Cadre 
Coordinator recommends candidates for FQS progression and qualification to the CO and 
oversees the development and performs final review of Qualification Packages for FQS QRBs in 
coordination with the Regional IWM Liaison Teams as required, and presents candidates for 
qualification to the QRB. The Cadre Coordinator will also recommend decertification of cadre 
members as needed to the CA and CO. 

Cadre Training Manager (if applicable): The Cadre Training Manager serves as the cadre’s 
primary point of contact for coordinating development and delivery of all FQS related training 
and oversees prioritization of all training within the cadre. 

Coach Evaluator: The coach-evaluator holds one of the most important roles in FQS. The 
coach-evaluator mentors the trainee/candidate and verifies that he or she is capable and qualified 
to perform a task and ultimately perform his or her job. 

Coach-evaluators: 

•  Are selected and approved by the senior cadre management 
•  Are qualified and certified under FQS in the position being evaluated as a primary or 

subordinate position 

•  Have completed “FQS Evaluator Training” (E/L/B 823) and “Overview of the FEMA 

Qualification System and Qualification Review Boards” (IS-207) 

The evaluator’s signature certifies competency in each task in the PTB. The evaluator must 
demonstrate the highest level of integrity when evaluating a trainee/candidate. An evaluator’s 
authority can be revoked if it is misused. For additional guidance, see the FQS Evaluator’s 
Guide.

Types of Training 
Table 9 describes the four types of training and education recognized by FEMA that are used to 
train cadre members. In accordance with OCCHCO guidance on employee training, integration 
and workforce development, the four forms of training and education follow: required training 
(of which FQS training is the major source for the incident management/incident support 
workforce), mandatory training (DHS and FEMA training for all employees), elective training, 
and professional development education. Below are the definitions of each type of training. The 
remainder of this chapter will focus primarily on required training (requirements for certification 
in FQS) and mandatory training for Reservists.

Development 
(FTE Only) 

Required training is for a specific employee as a condition of their job/position or 
duty station (e.g., FQS training, Contract Officer Representative training, supervisor 
training, etc.). Required training is identified to maintain a prescribed level of 
proficiency by Federal statute, Federal regulation, the DHS Secretary, the FEMA 
Administrator and/or the chief of a FEMA Component Organization. FQS-required 
training can be found in the position title qualification sheet (see Chapter 5: 
Qualifying). Cadre Coordinators, Training Managers, and the employee type 
managers (FTE, IM CORE, and Reservist) completely manage every aspect of this 
training for their cadre. 
Mandatory training is required for all FEMA employees, regardless of job/position 
or duty station (e.g., Ethics training, Equal Rights and Civil Rights training, 
Computer Security training, etc.). Mandatory training is established by Federal 
statute, Federal regulation, the DHS Secretary and/or the FEMA Administrator. 
Cadres are NOT required to track and manage mandatory training for full-time 
employees. The supervisors of record for the FTE’s steady-state position will retain 
this responsibility. The supervisor of record, dependent of cadre structure either 
the Cadre Coordinator, RPMs, or IM CORE Coordinator, must track mandatory 
training for Reservists and/or IM CORE. 
Elective training is training that is taken voluntarily (neither required nor 
mandatory) by an employee (e.g., advanced Microsoft Excel skills, Senior Executive 
Staff Candidate Development Program, etc.) to improve their Agency job and/or 
mission related proficiencies and that requires coordination with and/or approval 
by their supervisor because Agency resources are used and/or participation occurs 
during an employee’s work hours. FTEs will request elective training through their 
steady-state supervisor. Reservist requests will process through the cadre’s RPM. 
In workplaces, professional development refers to the acquisition of skills and 
knowledge, both for personal development and for career advancement. 
Professional development encompasses all types of facilitated learning 
opportunities, ranging from college degrees to formal coursework, conferences, 
and informal learning opportunities situated in practice. It has been described as 
intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage. OPM 
standards and regulations can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-
oversight/human-capital-management/reference-materials/leadership-knowledge-
management/developmenttraining.pdf

Training Type  Description 

provide technical and general knowledge and experience to career employees. 
Agencies may also establish leadership development programs to ensure leaders 
continue to develop and “grow” the knowledge and skill necessary to effectively 
lead the organization. 

Training encompasses the full range of duties, responsibilities, and missions required of FEMA’s 
incident workforce, and it must be embedded in all that the cadre does. Deploying personnel, 
operating equipment, communicating information, maintaining vehicles, and providing logistical 
support are all critical skills mastered only through training. Training provides the ability to 
follow procedures, to execute techniques, to apply tactics, and to integrate the capabilities of 
skills and services. 

FEMA’s Training Philosophy 
Effective training directly correlates to success in performance and mission. Successful 
organizations train as they intend to operate and operate as they were trained. A cadre’s training 
program needs to be based on this philosophy for cadre members to achieve future success 
during an incident. FEMA’s mandate to lead the nation in preparing for, protecting from, 
responding to, recovering from, and mitigating incidents as well as its obligation to ensure a 
professional workforce capable of executing this mission, necessitate this approach. 

FEMA’s Training Mandate 
FEMA’s mandate for training is simple and compelling: FEMA must be the most prepared when 
our nation is least prepared to respond to, recover from, and mitigate a catastrophic man-made or 
natural disaster. Catastrophic incidents place rigorous physical, psychological, and moral 
demands on emergency managers and the environment. These demands during an incident 
require substantial dedication, perseverance, and motivation to ensure the highest possible 
chance of success. Since FEMA must be prepared to meet the challenges posed by these 
incidents, catastrophic events determine training directions and goals. 

Success in the field/at the incident level during an incident also demands that an organization be 
led by well-educated, trained, and competent leaders to ensure that their cadre is mentally and 
physically prepared through thorough training. Such training ranges from individual training and 
readiness to comprehensive team-training and exercises. Pursuit of the highest possible quality 
training must become a professional imperative and second nature for FEMA.  

Principles of Training 
Cadre training philosophy has its roots in six fundamental principles: 

1.  Train for Operations 
2.  Require Leadership Involvement and Ownership 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Train to Standards 
4.  Use Performance-Oriented Training 
5.  Promote Team Operations 
6.  Challenge Employees 

All cadre managers must understand and apply these principles at every level of training. These 
principles provide sound and proven direction; they are flexible enough to accommodate the 
demands of local conditions and the judgment of individual leaders and other trainers. These 
principles are not inclusive, nor do they guarantee success. They are guides that all can use to 
design and assess organizational training programs. 

Train for Operations 
A catastrophic incident is the ultimate test of training. All FEMA training is fundamentally based 
on training employees on how to operate during a catastrophic incident. Therefore, all steady-
state training must reflect the requirements levied on a cadre during a catastrophic event. 

All FEMA leaders must ensure that individual cadre members receive realistic training that 
simulates, to the greatest extent possible, the conditions of a catastrophic incident. Training 
should prepare cadre members to perform their tasks and meet operational standards during the 
complex, stressful, and dangerous situations they will encounter during a catastrophic incident. 
FEMA’s philosophy is to train well in steady-state so that it can perform well during a 
catastrophic incident. 

Require Leadership Involvement and Ownership 
Leaders at all levels are responsible for the training and performance of their personnel and 
organization. They do more than manage training. The leaders’ personal presence and 
involvement demonstrate to all that training is the number one priority. Senior leaders personally 
train each direct report; COs train their Cadre Coordinators; Cadre Coordinators train their cadre 
management staff, and so on. This simple but practical approach allows for standardization from 
above, for flexibility at the trainer’s level, and for a clear progression of skills and understanding. 

Train to Standards 
Standards-based training is the use of common procedures and uniform operational methods to 
create a common perspective within FEMA. Training standards are currently published as 
individual training core competencies for each incident management job title and will be 
published as mission performance standards for each organized team/unit. All training must 
conform to these standards as they allow the incident workforce to train, and operate from a 
common perspective and provide cadre managers/leaders with a firm foundation upon which to 
request needed resources to support the training. This method of training will be further reflected 
in FEMA doctrine, processes, and procedures.

Use Performance-Oriented Training 
All members of a cadre must be proficient in the basic skills required to perform their jobs 
during an incident, and all FEMA leaders need to believe in the ability of the workforce to 
perform with a high level of skill and competency. To achieve this objective and increase 
confidence in employee proficiency, all training must be performance-oriented. All cadre 
members will be trained to meet published standards, not merely to occupy the time designated 
for training. To successfully complete and receive credit for training, students need to 
demonstrate a propensity to execute program tasks. Cadre members will then refine these skills 
through experience as a “trainee” prior to attaining qualification. 

Promote Team Operations 
FEMA operates as one team during an incident despite distribution of operations across 
geographical locations. Because of this, intra- and inter-cadre teams must train together on a 
regular basis. To support this, routine employment of the full spectrum of cadre functions must 
be practiced regularly. 

Challenge Employees 
Training must be challenging and develop new skills in order to build competence and 
confidence. The pride and satisfaction gained by meeting training challenges instills loyalty and 
dedication. It inspires excellence by fostering initiative, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn. 

A Mission Essential Task List Approach to Cadre Training 
Development 
To obtain maximum benefits, all cadre training programs derive from a mission analysis. The 
mission analysis provides a careful assessment of possible missions, identifies specified and 
implied tasks, and is the foundation for the development of a mission essential task list (METL). 
A cadre’s mission is the basis for the development and execution standards of the tasks. A cadre 
should not train for tasks that are not dictated by their mission during an incident. Cadres, units, 
and teams will be taught these tasks according to prescribed collective and individual training 
standards set forth in individual training core competencies or mission performance standards. 

Mission Essential Task List Fundamentals 
The METL is derived from the cadre’s mission statement, doctrinal employment, incident 
missions, and other related tasks. All cadres in FEMA will prepare METLs that are approved by 
the cadre’s CA. Each cadre’s METL is approved by the next higher organization in the 
operational chain of command (e.g., DSA Team METL is approved by the DSA Cadre 
Manager). Each cadre’s METL must support and complement the METLs of organizations 
above them in the chain of command (e.g., the METLs for a DSA team must support and 
compliment the METLs of the DSA Cadre). In similar organizations, mission-essential tasks may 
vary significantly because of different incident missions or geographical locations. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The availability of resources does not affect METL development. The METL is an unconstrained 
statement of the tasks required to accomplish incident missions. Since the METL forms the basis 
for the funding and resourcing of a cadre’s training plans, it is stabilized once approved. The 
METL is normally modified only if changes occur in the organization’s missions. Since incident 
plans are used as critical input to the METL development process, every effort should be made to 
solidify/stabilize incident missions in every plan. A significant revision of an organization’s 
mission can result in major changes to its METL and require subsequent major modifications to 
training plans and limited funding. 

The CA in coordination with their COs and Cadre Coordinators have the responsibility for 
developing a training strategy that maintains cadre proficiency for all tasks designated as mission 
essential. There should be no attempt to prioritize tasks within the METL. By definition, all 
METL tasks are equally essential to ensure mission accomplishment. CAs, COs, and Cadre 
Coordinators should involve members of their cadre in METL development to create a team 
approach to mission-oriented training. Cadre member participation develops a common 
understanding of the organization’s critical mission requirements so that METLs throughout the 
cadre are mutually supporting. 

After the collective mission-essential tasks required to accomplish the organization’s mission 
have been designated, individual tasks that support mission-essential tasks can be identified and 
documented in organizational training publication, handbooks, and FQS PTBs. 

Mission Essential Task List Development 
The Cadre Coordinator should review and identify those tasks essential to the accomplishment of 
the cadre’s incident mission for training priority. The objective is to establish training for these 
essential tasks to achieve proficiency. The cadre can train for all other tasks as resources allow. 
This process concentrates the organization’s steady-state training efforts on the most important 
collective training tasks required to accomplish the incident mission. This selection process 
reduces the number of training tasks because a cadre cannot achieve and sustain proficiency on 
every possible task. 

Training Standards 
After mission-essential tasks have been identified, Cadre Coordinators must extract supporting 
conditions and evaluation criteria for each task. The Cadre Coordinator will then set and 
maintain clear standards for training performance. 

Training Assessment 
The training assessment compares the cadre’s current level of training proficiency with the 
desired level of incident proficiency. The desired level of incident proficiency is defined in 
training standards. Training assessments will be conducted by a training assessment team, which 
will consist of the CO, the Cadre Coordinator, and the Cadre Training Manager, if applicable, of

a specific cadre in coordination with and assistance from IWMD. Training assessment will be 
conducted on a regular basis for each cadre. 

The training assessment team will determine current training proficiency levels of a cadre by 
reviewing all available training evaluations as well as incident performance evaluations. Each 
evaluation applies only to a portion of the total proficiency of an organization at a specific time. 
Therefore, the training assessment team will have access to all available evaluation data to 
develop an assessment of the organization’s overall capability to accomplish each task in the 
METL. In addition to past training evaluations, future events could influence the assessment. 

Required (FQS) Training 
FEMA will train and certify all cadre members in accordance with guidelines established in the 
FQS Guide and Chapter 5: Qualifying Members of a Cadre. All cadres will carry out FQS 
required training development, scheduling, and delivery in accordance with the FEMA 
Qualification System Guide for Incident Management and Incident Support Positions (available 
at http://www.fema.gov/about/employees/fqs.shtm) and other authorized FQS supporting 
documentation. The point of contact for FQS funding, scheduling, course development, and 
delivery is fema-iwmd-curriculumdelivery@fema.dhs.gov. 

Funding for FQS training is centralized within IWMD and must be considered separate from 
mandatory training. Each Cadre Coordinator, and Cadre Training Manager, if applicable, is 
responsible for tracking their allocated budget for FQS training. Training provided through 
FEMA’s Federal Incident Workforce Academy (FIWA) is funded and sourced by IWMD. FIWA 
training is offered to all incident workforce employees, regardless of cadre, providing the first 
course required to achieve a FQS qualification and preparing employees for both follow-on 
program specific training and deployment activity. IWMD will coordinate with the Cadre 
Coordinator regarding available funding for the development of appropriate training, delivery, 
and prioritization of all FQS training needs within the allocated budget. All FQS required 
training, other than FIWA, is allocated based on the cadre’s force structure size for the cadres to 
manage. All development and course delivery costs should be planned and scheduled in the out-
years with this funding target, based on a per-capita allotment, in mind. IWMD recognizes this as 
a target, not a red-line. Therefore, funding is negotiable based on demonstrated need. 

Scheduling courses, projecting current course revisions and modifications, and course 
development is ultimately the responsibility of the cadres and their Training Manager. IWMD 
manages the scheduling and out-year cost projection process, but it cannot do the work of course 
determination or modification for the cadre. Training priorities for the incident workforce, 
including course development and delivery, will be determined by each Cadre Coordinator based 
on policy and doctrine, FQS requirements, and other position-specific training requirements. 
Cadre Training Managers, if applicable, or a single designee will serve as the cadre’s primary

point of contact for the development and delivery of all FQS related training, and oversee the 
prioritization of all training within the cadre. 

For this reason, the cadre management team must keep detailed records on what training their 
employees have and have not completed, using FQS data tools and National Emergency Training 
Center transcripts to validate their records. Each summer, at the start of that year’s fourth quarter 
(Q4), IWMD will publish a memorandum instructing Certifying Authorities and Officials to 
begin preparation for requesting courses in the “out-year” defined as October of the following 
year (i.e., instructions issued in July 2014 for scheduling in FY16). Along with this 
memorandum, IWMD will provide each cadre with their FQS Required Training budget as well 
as a list of employees that require each course. It is important to note that the FQS data has 
inherent time lags and may not represent reality with 100% accuracy. Further, the cadre will train 
some of these employees during training in that quarter and the next fiscal year. Therefore, when 
preparing an out-year schedule, the training manager must also account for training that is 
already scheduled to occur in the current and next FY. To that end, each cadre should use the 
following inputs when preparing out-year FQS schedules: FQS budget, force structure and 
current force strength, planned hiring, scheduled training, course development needs, and course 
need as determined by those with open PTBs. Once the Cadre Coordinator and Training 
Manager build a case for their out-year schedule, they should gain approval from their CO and 
submit the requests to their IWMD FQS Point of Contact no later than 31 August. Once vetted 
by IWMD against existing qualification data and negotiated between IWMD and the cadre 
management team, the request will be stamped and submitted to EMI for scheduling and location 
determination no later than 15 October, twelve months from the start of the next FY. When the 
cadre identifies a course need that is not currently offered by FEMA or an outside certification 
agency, the cadre management team, its associated EMI course manager, and the FQS branch 
will work with the cadre to generate a contract and fund course development, and then validate 
that new course through pilots and focus groups. In December, EMI will publish a training 
calendar for the next FY, identifying what courses it was able to schedule at EMI and which 
courses they will have to hold at off sites such as Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), 
Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), or within a region. 

Enrollment for Scheduled FQS Courses 
The process of enrolling employees in FQS courses through course completion involves five 
main organizations: 1) Cadre Management Teams, 2) EMI Course Managers, 3) FQS Curriculum 
Delivery and Development Teams, 4) IWMD and Business Management Division budget 
offices, and 5) the Pasadena Call Center. The following are the impacts to cadres as they ensure 
that employees attend and complete the training required on their qualification sheet. 

•  Prior to a given course, the FQS Branch will provide the course manager with a pre-

approved list of those employees with open PTBs who require that course. The Course 
Manager will then “announce” the course to this population, taking care to carbon copy

the affected Cadre Coordinators, cadre training managers, regional training managers, 
and regional IWMD liaisons.  

•  The sponsoring cadre will coordinate with the assigned EMI Course Manager 6-12 weeks 
prior to a course to identify all pertinent travel requirements and special instructions for a 
course. This information submitted to IWMD to generate a blank group travel 
authorization (TA) for a given scheduled course. 

•  Cadre Coordinators in conjunction with Cadre Managers will then identify those within 
their population who can attend the course and will compare it to the data provided by 
IWMD (FQS Branch). Cadre Coordinators and Course Managers will agree upon an 
initial roster of employees six weeks prior to a course. 

•  Following a course invitation from National Emergency Training Center, Course 

Managers will publish, via email, the course details to the Cadre Coordinators impacted 
as well as all employees on the initial roster no earlier than four weeks from the start of a 
course. That course announcement will include a standardized notification as well as 
details specific to the course such as the TA and travel details. Any late additions to the 
course will receive all required information as soon as they are identified by the Course 
Manager as attending the course. 

•  FQS Branch, through the Pasadena Call Center, will ensure that all attendees are added in 
the Integrated Financial Management Information System to the corresponding course 
travel authorization for payment purposes. 

•  The Pasadena Call Center is responsible for coordinating with the OCFO for increasing 

all government travel card limits prior to IWMD training related travel. 

•  The Pasadena Call Center processes requests for IWMD sponsored training for Reservists 
by activating and validating their WebTA account, processing deployment requests for 
FQS courses or pilots, and processing travel vouchers. 

•  FTEs shall process all travel and time and attendance through their steady-state 

supervisor of record. 

•  Cadre Coordinators and their training manager should have a mechanism in place to audit 
the official FEMA transcript system to ensure that the course certificates and credits are 
annotated accurately on individual transcripts.  

Mandatory Training 
Mandatory training is required for all FEMA employees, regardless of job/position or duty 
station. Mandatory training includes training that is necessary to introduce, reinforce, or clarify 
law to improve the function of the government, protect the safety of our employees, 
communicate FEMA core values, or to improve the function of FEMA. Mandatory training may 
be required by Federal statutes, Federal regulations, DHS policy, or FEMA policy. For instance, 
all employees receive training in fraud protection and prevention, equal rights, privacy, and 
security. Additionally, OCC Ethics shall provide all new employees with initial orientation and 
annual ethics training.

The default method of delivery for mandatory training will be distribution via web-based content 
or e-learning content. The training may also be available in the field for deployed personnel. For 
FTEs, it is the supervisor of record who is responsible for the cadre members’ mandatory 
training, not the Cadre Coordinator. For Reservists and IM CORE cadre members, Cadre 
Coordinators or Cadre Training Managers, if applicable, will ensure maintenance of mandatory 
training records. The FEMA/DHS learning management systems of record are the appropriate 
tools for proof-of-course completion and the location for certificates and transcripts. For 
Reservists, Cadre Coordinators or Cadre Training Managers, if applicable, will ensure that 
Reservist cadre members are taking the available mandatory training and are receiving 
appropriate compensation. 

The Assistant Administrator for Response’s June 27, 2013, memorandum on “Compensation for 
FEMA Reservist Coordination and Training Requirements” governs the process for 
compensation for mandatory training. Mandatory training and its associated pay processing must 
be properly documented as the entire process is subject to annual audit. IWMD will provide the 
funding for Reservists to take mandatory training. 

Annually, IWMD will re-publish the latest mandatory training list for Reservists. With this 
guidance, cadre management teams will ensure completion according to the pre-determined list 
of approved mandatory courses, which are not to exceed 40 total hours in a given calendar year. 

Programmatic Updates 
Cadre Coordinators will provide regular and timely communication to all cadre members and 
Regional IWM Liaison Teams on programmatic and administrative changes and/or issues. The 
Cadre Coordinator ensures cadre members have access to program-specific information that is 
required to perform effectively during incident operations. Programmatic updates and cadre-
specific training may be accomplished through cadre calls. For more information regarding the 
process used for programmatic updates and cadre calls, refer to Chapter 9: Communication and 
Coordination.

CHAPTER 5: QUALIFYING MEMBERS OF A CADRE 

This chapter is designed to provide the Cadre Coordinators a working reference focused on 
administering the aspects of FQS. The application of all qualification processes, the general 
principles of equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination apply. The FQS Guide, 
Qualification Review Guide, and FQS Evaluator’s Guide are the reference documents that 
prescribe the functionality of the qualification and credentialing system and determine the 
requirements that the following topic areas address. There are three elements to qualification that 
an employee must do: 

1.  Experience - Complete the required FQS experience 
2.  Training - Complete the required training identified on the position's qualification sheet 
3.  Demonstrated Performance - Complete an assigned PTB by demonstrated performance 

(in accordance with Coach-Evaluator program) 

FQS Documentation 
A qualification sheet and PTB are developed for each FQS position and a progression flowchart 
is created for each cadre. The qualification sheet lists the required FQS experience, training, and 
certifications needed to be considered for certification in a position title. The PTB outlines the 
technical competencies and general competencies that must be performed and validated to be 
considered for certification. The progression flowchart maps a path for career advancement for 
each FQS position. In addition, there is a qualification sheet that lists training required for all 
Command and General Staff positions based upon tier level. 

The IWMD FQS Branch manages the publication of a cadre's qualification sheets, PTBs, and 
progression flowcharts. It is important to ensure that any position-related training changes, 
including course numbers, are accurately reflected on the position qualification sheets. The 
qualification sheets are the basis for the FQS Curriculum Delivery team's determination of 
appropriate student requisite training needs. Additionally, where competencies can be migrated 
from a classroom delivery into a PTB determined task, cadres should enhance the PTB thereby 
reducing classroom training time and focusing on demonstrating the performance in the field. 

•  Qualification Sheets – The qualification sheets are used as a basis for formal training, 
certifications, and experience requirements for each position. Specific courses must be 
listed on a qualification sheet before they can be scheduled for delivery. 

•  Position Task Books – PTBs are designed to be a guide to on-the-job training as well as 
a formal record of performance evaluation. The behaviors and activities listed in the 
PTBs are not all inclusive to the actual requirements of a position; they are intended to 
reflect the spirit and intent of the position. Only designated evaluators are authorized to 
validate completion of tasks in an employee’s PTB.

•  Progression Flowcharts – The progression flowchart diagrams the organizational 

structure of a cadre. 

Revisions to FQS Documentation 
Revisions and changes to qualification sheets, PTBs, and progression flowcharts must be based 
on identified deficiencies and mission essential needs. To request revisions, cadre management 
should submit change requests to the FQS Branch by email to fema-fqs-program@fema.dhs.gov 
with “FQS Documentation Revision” in the subject line. Some changes may require CCWG 
and/or IWESC approval before implementation. At a minimum, the request should include the 
following information: 

•  Cadre 
•  Positions affected 
•  Specific changes 
• 

Justification of changes 

Managing the Paperwork 
This section will provide the background and support necessary to assign a title, issue a PTB, 
manage the programs’ coach-evaluator responsibilities, certify that an employee is qualified, and 
assist with other cadre responsibilities related to FQS. These processes often rely on specific 
forms completed by either cadre administrators or the employee. Supporting business rules and 
the forms (containing their detailed instructions for completion) are provided in appendices C-F. 

Frequently used forms include: 

•  FQS Transmittal Log (FTL) – The official form to document employee certification 

actions 

•  Candidate Position Task Book Issuance Form – The official form to document the 

issuance of a PTB to a candidate 

•  Employee Request Form (ERF) – Form used to request qualification review for non-

supervisory positions 

•  ERF – QRB – Form used to request qualification review for supervisory positions 

Letter templates can be used as guides for employee communications. These letters can include: 

•  Certification Letter – used to notify an employee of certification 
•  Decertification Letter – used to notify an employee of decertification 
•  Non-acceptance Letter – used to notify an employee they do not meet the standards of 

qualification

Assignment of an Initial Position Title 

Initial Assignment 
An initial FQS job title is assigned to employees who have never held an FQS job title. This 
designation allows an employee to deploy to an incident operation in an incident management 
position and to be enrolled in position specific training. In addition to a specific title, employees 
will be assigned a proficiency level in the FQS system: 

•  Trainee – assigned a PTB, but not yet qualified 
•  Qualified – qualified in the FQS position designated by the cadre 
•  Candidate – qualified in an FQS position and also issued a PTB for a different position 

Programs will consider a number of factors to determine qualification including: 

•  Number and length of deployments 
•  PTB or verification of position held on deployment (i.e., Incident Action Plan 

organization chart, letter from incident leadership or section chief, or ICS 204 form with 
assignment) 

•  Variety of incidents worked (e.g., floods, tornadoes, hurricanes), their size and 

complexity, and the number of assignments 

•  Other related non-FEMA experience that equates to experience gained in FEMA 

functional areas OR from other agencies/organizations that equate to the FEMA-based 
knowledge and skill requirements for the position 

•  Required training or accepted equivalency training for FQS positions; course equivalency 

may not be used to certify employees for Type I positions 
Incident performance evaluations (performance evaluations not applicable) 

• 

The process for obtaining an initial FQS job title varies slightly depending upon the type of 
employee. All requests, regardless of employee type, will receive a decision or some 
communication from the cadre within 60 days of receipt. 

Reservist: Reservists are hired directly into an FQS job title. The cadre management team will 
determine the employee's FQS job title and proficiency and ensure the information is entered 
into the FEMA deployment and qualification tracking system. 

IM CORE: IM COREs are hired to fulfill an incident management title. The cadre management 
team will determine the employee's initial FQS job title and proficiency and ensure the 
information is entered into the FEMA deployment and qualification tracking system. IM CORE 
employees will begin the next level of certification, as needed to reach certification for hired 
title.

IMAT: IMAT members are hired to fulfill an incident management title for a specific position 
on a national or regional IMAT. The cadre management team will determine the employee’s 
initial proficiency and ensure the information is entered into the FEMA deployment and 
qualification tracking system. IMAT members will complete an IMAT Academy that provides 
the required training and exercises to validate proficiency and begin the next level of certification 
as needed. 

Full Time Employee (PFT, TFT, and CORE): FTEs can be assigned to various roles in 
support of FEMA’s mission. Employees should consider their personal goals and abilities prior 
to requesting an FQS job title. Additionally, employees and their supervisors should determine 
which support role best suits the employee, their supervisor, and the Agency. 

Each FTE will fulfill one of four roles in support of disaster survivors: 

Incident Management – incident field operations staff 
Incident Support – NRCC or RRCC staff 

• 
• 
•  Mission Essential – staff required to maintain mission essential functions 
•  Ancillary Support – staff deployed at their normal duty station to support incident 

operations 

To request an initial title, FTEs will complete an ERF (for non-supervisory positions) or ERF – 
QRB (for supervisory positions). Table 10 lists the process for non-supervisory positions, and 
table 11 lists the steps in the process for supervisory positions.

appendix G. 

Subordinates Titles 
All employees will hold one primary classification – incident management, incident support, 
mission essential, or ancillary support. Employees classified as incident management or incident 
support will hold a primary job title and may have up to three subordinate titles. Employees 
classified as ancillary support and mission essential support incident operation through their day-
to-day role within FEMA. As such, they may not hold primary incident management or incident 
support job titles. If ancillary support and mission essential employees also hold current incident 
management or incident support titles, they will be listed as subordinate titles to their ancillary 
support and mission essential role within FQS. Subordinate titles do not count against force 
structure limitations. 

Subordinate incident management titles represent proficiencies from positions within their 
progression path or other relevant positions within their cadre. For example, an Operations 
Section Chief Type I would hold that title as their primary FQS job title. Operations Section 
Chief Type II, Operations Section Chief Type III, and depending on the career progression of the

individual (progression could have been from Operations Branch Director, Public Assistance 
Branch Director, or Individual Assistance Branch Director), the qualification held by the 
individual could be listed as the third subordinate title held. Not all individuals will hold three 
subordinate titles. Qualifications for personnel who have transferred from outside the program 
may be assigned based upon the cadre's desires. An employee can have a subordinate title in 
another cadre, and acceptance of a subordinate title in a different cadre can result in the 
individual being deployed under that experience/qualification.  

FQS Business Rules for Subordinate Titles 

•  An individual may be assigned up to three subordinate titles; these titles should be a 

direct progression per the Cadre Progression Chart.6 

•  Subordinate titles should be the highest ranking positions the individual is personally 

qualified to perform.  

•  Subordinate title proficiency level should always be qualified. 

o  IM CORE New Hires may temporarily be assigned Trainee subordinate titles for 

the purpose of training. 

•  As directed in FD010-8, an employee can only be deployed in a subordinate job title if no 

one with the requested title is available in the deployment system. 

•  The employee’s CO approves the subordinate titles if not identified on the Qualification 

Letter. 

•  The IWMD Deployment Unit enters, changes, or updates subordinate titles upon receipt 
of signed memo from the CO, the Cadre Coordinator. This information may also be 
included on the transmittal log/decision letter when there is a change in qualification. 
If QRB recommends an FQS job title for an employee, they should establish the 
recommended subordinate titles at the same time. 

• 

•  An employee selected and qualified as an evaluator can only evaluate their primary and 

identified subordinate job titles. 

•  Subordinate titles are subject to four year recertification and are automatically renewed if 

the primary title is retained. 

Issuance of Position Task Books 

Issuance Policy 
Employees may request a PTB for the next position in their progression with approval from their 
supervisor of record if they are certified in their current position. The employee requests to open 
a PTB through the Cadre Coordinator; their CO may also provide authorization. All requests will 
receive a communication from the cadre coordinator within 60 days concerning the decision of 

6 Subordinates CAN be carried for other programs at the discretion of the cadre issuing the primary FQS job title – 
for those cadres with positions that crossover.

whether or not to issue a PTB. (See appendix G for more information.) If approved, the PTB will 
be issued using the PTB Issuance Form. Although an employee may attend requisite training, 
gain experience, and demonstrate performance, the qualification of an employee may not be 
granted until a Force Structure opening becomes available. The cadre will then utilize the 
Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel process for selection of an employee and submission within 
the existing qualification/credentialing process. 

Position Task Book Issuance Form 
The Position Task Book Issuance Form must be completed and sent to the Pasadena Call Center 
(FEMA-FQS-Program@fema.dhs.gov) for processing to ensure the employee is denoted as 
having an open PTB in the qualification tracking system. This process allows the IWMD 
Curriculum Delivery Team to maintain awareness with respect to the requisite training the 
candidate may now be scheduled to attend. 

Time Limits for Completion of PTBs 
A trainee/candidate must complete an assigned PTB within four years, beginning with 
documentation of the trainee/candidate’s first completion of a task in the PTB. If the 
trainee/candidate does not complete the PTB within four years, the PTB will no longer be valid. 
If a new PTB is initiated, all current qualification standards will apply. 

PTB Completion/Submission Process 
Submission of the completed PTB or individual task sign offs are a responsibility of the 
employee. 

Candidate Selection for Advancement 
For employee advancement and higher-level qualification, an employee must complete the 
requisite training, complete the cadre issued PTB, and accumulate the necessary experience for 
the higher level position. The process begins with the issuance of the PTB for the position within 
the progression path. 

When a vacant position needs to be filled, an SME panel (FQS-qualified at or above the position 
being reviewed) may be convened to evaluate and select the best candidate from all the 
candidates who have completed the PTB. The SME panel is required for supervisory positions. 
The panel will recommend their selection for CO certification or for sending to the QRB 
(supervisory position). Completing a PTB does not guarantee progression into the next position. 

Once a completed request package for certification is received, the Cadre Coordinator is required 
to provide communication back to the employee within 60 days. Communication can be a

Reconsideration Process 
Reconsideration is a process that begins with an employee requesting consideration of a decision 
by a CA with the intent of reversing or modifying the current incident qualification decision. 

An employee may request reconsideration of a qualification decision by submitting a written 
request within 60 days after receipt of a decision. The request should include supporting 
documentation that clarifies or amplifies documents originally submitted and/or any new 
documentation that supports the employee’s claim of competency for the targeted position. 

The CO or the QRB will review the request for reconsideration. (COs will only review non-
supervisory positions. A QRB will review all other positions.) The CA will make the final 
decision. 

The reconsideration process is the same as the certification process outlined in this section. 
Employees will receive a response to their reconsideration request within 60 days of receipt. A 
reconsideration decision by a CA is final. 

Specialties 
A specialty is a category used to identify a specific and measured (documented or credentialed) 
skill, task, experience, or certification based on recognized standards. A specialty is necessary to 
enhance performance of an associated incident management position. It must be distinct, 
empirically derived and not a general credentialing requirement for an FQS position. 

All requests for new specialties will be reviewed and approved by the CCWG and will be 
considered using consistent standards. 

•  Specialties are generally program area specific. 
•  Specialties must be held by a sufficient number of employees and not be used to target a 

narrow group of employees repeatedly for deployment.

•  Specialties must not be the same as a requirement of a current FQS position. 
•  Specialties must be validated and approved by CO. 

Assigning and managing specialties: 

•  The Cadre Coordinator will approve and assign a specialty to a specific employee. 
•  The requirements to maintain a specialty will be managed by the cadre management. 
•  The Deployment Unit will maintain employee records in the deployment database. 

When approved to add a cadre specific specialty (by CCWG), the Specialty Confirmation form is 
completed and routed via the CCWG Chairperson who will then forward it to the Deployment 
Unit for incorporation into the deployment tracking system. Cadre leadership is responsible for 
the maintenance and currency of the personnel and the associated specialty 
qualification/requalification requirements.

CHAPTER 6: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT 

One of the main functions of FEMA’s cadre management system is to ensure that all members of 
the workforce are able to perform and continue to perform optimally in an incident environment. 
This demands that the employee’s leadership conduct recurring analysis and assessment of the 
employee’s performance. This is effectively accomplished through a sound deployment 
performance evaluation methodology. Employees, regardless of employee type, must receive a 
comprehensive performance evaluation at the conclusion of their deployment. For FTE 
employees, their deployed performance appraisal may factor into their annual appraisal 
performed by their designated supervisor of record. 

This chapter is designed to provide Cadre Coordinators with an overview of the value of 
performance management for ensuring effective operational readiness of their cadre members, 
and will detail the performance management process for all employee types. 

Principles of Performance Management 
As the primary Federal entity responsible for incident preparedness and response, FEMA relies 
on the incident workforce to accomplish the mission of helping survivors in their time of need. 
FEMA’s greatest asset is its workforce. A robust FQS and performance assessment are essential 
to have a fully trained and qualified workforce. The performance assessment system aligns 
directly to mission goals and demonstrates mission success through evaluation of the workforce. 

The goal of performance assessments is to foster and build a culture of responsibility and 
ownership amongst the workforce. The system informs each employee what is expected during 
deployment and provides employees information about their measures of success. The 
performance assessment system holds individuals accountable for their performance. The system 
of accountability fosters a high-performing workforce trained and capable of serving the nation. 

Performance evaluations will be produced by the supervisor of record or the temporary duty 
supervisor. The Cadre Coordinator, FTE Coordinator, RPM, and IM CORE Program Manager 
will collect the field performance evaluations. 

Individual Incident Performance Evaluation 
Performance assessment during incidents should align to individual performance. The process is 
conducive to timely and meaningful feedback and should provide a framework for administrative 
and operational management decisions as it relates to deployed personnel. For FTEs (PFTs, 
TFTs, COREs, and IM COREs), these evaluations serve as supplemental materials in the overall 
annual appraisal process that is facilitated through the supervisor of record by the Agency. For 
intermittent employees, the evaluations serve as a means for timely feedback at the end of the 
deployment. 

The process for conducting an incident performance evaluation includes the following elements: 

54 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Every member of an incident workforce cadre who is deployed for 20 days or more shall 
receive an incident performance evaluation, in accordance with FD010-8, FEMA Incident 
Workforce Deployment, Section VIII.C, or superseding policy. 

•  The temporary duty station supervisor conducts FTE evaluations and provides them to 

the supervisor of record. 

•  The temporary duty station supervisor conducts IM CORE and Reservist evaluations and 

provides them to the respective IM CORE Program Manager or RPM. 

•  The temporary duty supervisor executes the performance evaluation. 
•  The Cadre Coordinator (or delegate including RPMs, FTE coordinator, or IM CORE 

Program Manager) assists with the performance evaluation process as needed. 

Incident performance evaluations may be factored into an FTE’s annual performance appraisal. 
The supervisor of record will consider the incident performance evaluation as he/she deems 
appropriate when completing the annual rating of record in accordance with FM 255-1-1-1, 
Employee Performance Management Program. 

Temporary duty supervisors must also consult with the Employee Relations Branch in OCCHCO 
and the employee’s supervisor of record when they encounter poor performance and provide all 
documents to the supervisor of record. Prior to initiating any personnel actions, the supervisor of 
record must consult with OCCHCO Employee Relations to ensure that any such actions are 
consistent with Merit Systems and Equal Employment Opportunity principles as well as FEMA 
policy.

play in the process.

CHAPTER 7: EQUIPPING MEMBERS OF A CADRE 

This chapter is designed to present information on equipment provided to individual cadre 
members. It is imperative that cadre members have immediate access to fully functional, 
position-appropriate equipment to achieve optimum operational readiness for their assigned 
incident duties. A fully equipped cadre member has received standard issue FEMA equipment, 
cadre specific equipment as identified by cadre leadership, a FEMA badge, FEMA branded 
clothing, and a government issued credit card. 

All cadre members will receive standard FEMA equipment during their onboarding with the 
Agency. Standard FEMA equipment for FTEs and IM COREs will be funded by the employee’s 
home office. Standard FEMA equipment for FEMA Reservists will be funded from the Disaster 
Relief Fund and procured by LMD in coordination with the OCIO and the OCAO. 

Table 16 outlines the roles and responsibilities for members of cadre management and specific 
offices supporting the cadres in relation to the equipping of the cadres.

Principles for Equipping Members of a Cadre 
FEMA’s incident workforce must be able to quickly deploy and build upon operations in 
advance of, or following, an incident. To effectively support the incident workforce, FEMA’s 
equipment strategy states that FEMA must: 

•  Ensure FEMA can regularly communicate with all members of the incident workforce 
(whether they are deployed or not) to ensure readiness; this includes access to the most 
current information about FEMA policies and programs, equipment upgrades, and 
completion of required training 

•  Leverage opportunities to increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
•  Ensure members of the incident workforce have access to equipment that is most 

appropriate for their job functions 

•  Comply with personal property regulations and policy 

The determination on the type of equipment issued will be dependent upon the cadre member’s 
FQS job title. 

Cadre Coordinators will communicate operational equipment requirements that are beyond or in 
lieu of standard FEMA equipment to IWMD, who will coordinate with LMD and OCIO to 
ensure position-appropriate equipment is procured and readily available for distribution to meet 
operational requirements. 

Primary Responsibilities for Equipping a Cadre 

Cadre Coordinators 

• 

Identifying equipment requirements: Cadres identify the specific equipment necessary 
to complete the mission and communicate these requirements to LMD. Cadre 
Coordinators identify the equipment needs of their entire cadre. Cadre Coordinators or 
their designees communicate with cadre members to determine the status of staff 
equipment and assist in addressing any issues. 

•  Authorization for distribution: The Cadre Coordinator authorizes the distribution of 

cadre specific equipment to cadre members. 

•  Equipment budget determination: The Cadre Coordinator provides cost estimates for 

equipment needs to LMD for FY budget requirements. 

•  Equipment status: Cadre Coordinators maintain accurate data related to the equipment 
status of Reservist and IM CORE cadre members and ensure that information is updated 
in the FEMA system of record by collaborating with the designated Cadre Accountable 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Property Officer (APO) in the Property Management Division of LMD (LMD-PMD).7 
The Cadre Coordinator also coordinates with the cadre’s APO to track and order 
equipment, or coordinate the repair of issued equipment as necessary. Cadre Coordinators 
are able to access data related to equipment issued to cadre members, which they use to 
monitor the equipment status of their cadre and ensure accountability and operability of 
all assigned equipment. Cadre Coordinators communicate to and work directly with LMD 
and OCIO to resolve any identified equipment shortfalls (e.g., expired, lost, or broken 
equipment) among Reservist cadre members. 

•  Badging: The Cadre Coordinator approves cadre members badging requests. 
•  Reasonable Accommodations: Cadre Coordinators communicate operational equipment 
requirements that are beyond or in lieu of standard FEMA equipment to IWMD, who 
then coordinate with LMD and OCIO to ensure position-appropriate equipment is 
procured and readily available for distribution to meet operational requirements. 

Reservist Program Manager and IM CORE Program Manager 

• 

Identifying equipment requirements: In support of the Cadre Coordinator, RPMs and 
IM CORE Program Managers provide accurate information related to equipment 
distribution, maintenance, and accountability of Reservists. 

•  Equipment Budget Determination: The RPMs and IM Core Program Managers provide 
cost estimates for equipment needs to the Cadre Coordinator for FY budget requirements. 

•  Equipment Status: At the direction of the Cadre Coordinator, the RPM/IM CORE 

Program Manager ensures that information is updated in the FEMA System of Record, in 
coordination with LMD. 

•  Reasonable Accommodations: The RPMs and IM Core Program Managers 

communicate operational equipment requirements that are beyond or in lieu of standard 
FEMA equipment to the Cadre Coordinator, who coordinates with LMD and OCIO to 
ensure position-appropriate equipment is procured and readily available for distribution 
to meet operational requirements. 

Office of the Chief Information Officer 

•  Equipment Issuance/ Funding: OCIO coordinates with IWMD and OCCHCO to 

support the issuing and set up of information technology and communications equipment 
during the onboarding of cadre members. OCIO provides cost analysis and breakdown of 
information technology and communications equipment.  

•  Equipment Status: The OCIO identifies and informs IWMD and LMD-PMD on the 
information technology and communication equipment FEMA has approved for 
procurement to support equipping the incident workforce. 

7 An APO is an individual designated in writing to maintain the accountability for FEMA property (in use or 
storage) in accordance with a prescribed system that shows the authorized debits, credits, and available balances on 
hand, or obligated for use, for such an activity.

Office of the Chief Security Officer 

•  Badging: OCSO coordinates with Cadre Coordinators, supervisors of record, and 

Regional Security Officers to provide Personal Identify Verification (PIV) applicants in 
the incident workforce with badges. All applicants must meet the minimum requirements 
for a PIV in accordance with HSPD-12 policy based on the individual’s position 
sensitivity. A background status check will determine if the applicant meets all 
requirements for badging issuance. 

Incident Workforce Management Division 

•  Equipment Issuance/ Funding: IWMD serves as a coordination and information 

conduit to the various organizations involved in equipping cadre members of the incident 
workforce with standardized equipment. Through coordination and partnership with all 
stakeholders, IWMD ensures position-appropriate equipment is procured and readily 
available for distribution to meet all operational requirements. 

Federal Coordinating Officers 
In the event the employee does not have standard equipment already issued to them, FCOs work 
with their Logistics Section Chief and Program Lead(s) at the JFO to distribute equipment for 
any cadre members in the incident workforce. FCOs coordinate with the Logistics Section Chief 
and incident site APO to ensure equipment distribution information is recorded in the FEMA 
System of Record and subsequently transferred to the cadre accounts maintained by LMD-PM 
APO’s. FCOs ensure distributed equipment at the JFO is retained by the cadre member. 

Logistics Management Directorate 

•  Equipment Issuance/ Funding: LMD issues equipment for the following cadre 

members: IM CORE and Reservist, while OCAO issues equipment for PFTs and COREs 
with the appropriate funding to either LMD or CAO.8 LMD PMD will coordinate with 
Cadre Coordinators to distribute equipment to employees at the beginning of 
appointments/onboarding and retrieve equipment at the conclusion of employment 
appointments, when applicable, or when the equipment is no longer needed. LMD-PMD 
coordinates with OCIO on the distribution and property accountability for any electronic 
communications. LMD assigns an APO to each cadre and one for IM COREs. 

•  Equipment Status: Designated cadre APOs initiate and complete reports of survey in 

accordance with applicable Agency directives for equipment reported as lost or damaged. 
LMD, in coordination with the OCAO, maintains formal accountability and reporting in 
the FEMA System of Record. LMD Property Management maintains accountable records 
for fund code 06 employees and Support Services and Facilities Management Division 
(within OCAO) arranges for Accountable Officer support for fund code 90 employees

issues. 

FEMA Branded Clothing 
Cadre Coordinators provide FEMA clothing to its members if they are serving in a public-facing 
job title. Cadre management and incident personnel use FEMA-branded equipment in 
accordance with FD123-18, Standard FEMA-Distinctive Clothing. 

Government Issued Charge Card 
FTEs with IM positions, Reservists, and IM COREs receive travel cards through their supervisor 
of record. Cadre Coordinators inform the FTE supervisor of record that their employees are 
required to have a government issued charge card in good standing to deploy in their incident 
management roles. The supervisor of record contacts the appropriate Organizational Program 
Coordinator as soon as an entry onto duty notification is received from OCCHCO to ensure the 
expeditious delivery of the charge card. 

Badging Information 
Every FEMA employee is required to retain a valid, federally-issued government identification 
card (FEMA PIV card) for the purpose of accessing Federal facilities and certain government 
issued equipment (laptop). The issuance and replacement of badges can be accomplished by 
coordination with facilities within 65 miles of applicant such as: regional offices, headquarters, 
transitional recovery offices, incidents, special badging assignments, or other nationwide DHS 
PIV card issuance facilities. Personnel who resign their position, are terminated, or no longer 
require a badge or credential, must forward item(s) to FEMA HQ Access Control Office, 500 C 
Street SW, Washington, DC 20472-3100. Upon notification, FEMA HQ Access Control Office

officially notifies the employee to return all FEMA issued badges, credentials, and equipment. 
Items will be returned at government’s expense, utilizing appropriate tracking methods. 

Cadre Specific Equipment 
Cadre specific supplemental and/or ancillary equipment is identified and reported to LMD by the 
Cadre Coordinator. Processes and procedures associated with the issuance and return of these 
items are addressed in cadre-specific standard operating procedures. 

Reasonable Accommodations 
Deciding officials forward all adjudicated requests from all members of the cadre to OER for 
recordkeeping and reporting purposes in accordance with existing FEMA reasonable 
accommodation policy guidance. Funding for reasonable accommodations for Reservists is 
provided by IWMD from the Disaster Relief Fund. IWMD, in collaboration with OER, funds 
approved requests for reasonable accommodations. The Cadre Coordinator tracks all reasonable 
accommodation requests from origin to fulfillment. The Cadre Coordinator, along with IWMD 
and OER, conduct this approval process. .  

Support in Equipping a Cadre 
Cadre Coordinators ensure the accountability of standardized equipment for members of their 
cadre. Table 17 outlines support and points of contact for equipping a cadre to provide guidance 
and responsibilities for stakeholders vested in equipment issuance, maintenance, and 
accountability.

CHAPTER 8: CADRE READINESS ASSESSMENT 

The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the various aspects of cadre readiness and inform 
leadership about the incident management cadres’ ability to perform operations in the field/at the 
incident level.9 Cadre readiness and its assessment is targeted at ensuring that cadres can apply 
the right person with the right skill at the right time in the event of an emergency, but should not 
be considered a comprehensive evaluation of a cadre’s overall capabilities. Because these 
assessments are objective in nature, there are many subjective aspects of cadre performance not 
captured in these readiness assessments that vary by cadre and must be monitored and enforced 
by cadre management (e.g., exercises). 

Principles of Cadre Readiness Assessment 
To provide cadre and FEMA leadership with a transparent picture of incident management cadre 
readiness, IWMD produces an objective report that demonstrates cadre readiness across various 
staffing, equipping, and training metrics. The primary combined cadre reporting tool used for 
this purpose is the Cadre Operational Readiness and Deployability Status (CORDS) report. 
Additionally, IWMD provides cadre management teams with access to the individual readiness 
data for all employees within their incident management population. Once fully implemented, 
both the CORDS report and the individual readiness data will be available in a real-time 
dashboard using the deployment and training system of record. 

In the broadest sense, the CORDS assessment enables cadre managers and FEMA leadership to 
identify resource needs (personnel, equipment, and/or training) that will improve FEMA’s ability 
to rapidly respond and appropriately sustain operations to meet the needs of survivors. The 
assessment will also inform a force structure assessment to help FEMA maintain an 
appropriately balanced workforce. 

The CORDS report uses three categories to measure cadre performance (and variables within the 
category): 

•  Staffing: This includes cadre force strength, staff availability both of force strength 
(percent available to deploy out of those with incident management titles in a given 
cadre), and of force structure (the percent of employees available if the cadre were at full 
strength), percent deployed and percent who have requested non-availability. 

•  Training: This includes the qualification percentage across the cadre in primary FQS job 
titles both out of current force strength (percent of those in the cadre who are currently 
qualified in their primary FQS job title) and out of force structure (the percent of 
qualified employees if the cadre were at full strength). 

9 The current list of IM Cadres can be found in appendix I. Appendices K-T contain additional information that may 
be helpful to the FEMA incident workforce.

 •  Equipping: This includes the measure of equipment readiness based on the percent of 

Reservists and IM COREs who have their standardized equipment on-hand. 

This assessment uses objective metrics from the current systems of record to enforce use of these 
systems. 

Readiness Scores 
The CORDS report can be considered a readiness report card indicating current-time health of 
the incident workforce. The CORDS algorithm assigns an overall Deployability-Rating (D-
rating) to each cadre based on these pre-defined weights and thresholds. The percentages, 
weights, and qualifying thresholds used to “grade” the workforce, both within variables and 
categories, may adjust over time based on programmatic and leadership priority changes. The D-
ratings will be established and maintained by the IWESC. 

The readiness report card is a reflection of FEMA’s ability to respond, and not solely a reflection 
of a cadre’s performance. The cadres have a responsibility in ensuring their cadre is mission 
ready, as do the enabling organizations within the Agency. 

Assessment Methodology 
To fully enforce the FEMA systems of record used to deploy the incident workforce, the systems 
of record will feed the CORDS and individual readiness data. All staffing and training metrics 
are pulled from the deployment and training systems of record. The equipment metrics are 
currently pulled from a survey-based system and eventually will be a data feed from the property 
book system of record to the deployment and training system of record. These systems of record 
pull their data from other sources (e.g., National Finance Center, National Emergency Training 
Center, etc.) and as such, processing and transaction delays will result in a slight variation to the 
results.  

Categories are weighted to determine the overall D-rating with an emphasis on the Staffing 
category. Staffing is most heavily weighted to acknowledge that in critical situations, FEMA has 
the ability to surge equipment and execute on-the-job training, but may risk mission success 
when its cadres are not staffed in accordance with the force planning models.  

Responding to Cadre Scores 

The CORDS report will allow the cadre management team and its leadership to take the 
appropriate corrective action to improve cadre readiness. Cadre Coordinators should formally 
submit resource requests beyond their internal capability to the CCWG.

CHAPTER 9: COMMUNICATION AND 
COORDINATION 

This chapter is designed to identify and describe methods for Cadre Coordinators to use in 
effectively communicating to members of their respective cadres. It provides guidance on 
communication and coordination efforts across all levels of the incident workforce and identifies 
best practices. 

Principles of Communication 
To achieve the goal of a more-ready workforce, FEMA’s cadre management communication 
guidance outlined below recognizes the need to increase awareness and understanding across the 
entire incident workforce regarding staffing, training, qualifying, equipping, and performance 
management processes and objectives. It further aims to increase buy-in and commitment from 
all stakeholders to maintain high-readiness levels. 

FEMA has developed a number of methods and systems to support clear, consistent 
communication practices. These methods and systems include the use of individual readiness 
data, blast communications, coordination calls, and web-based collaboration sites. They are 
designed to support information sharing at the individual and collective levels and to ensure all 
employees, regardless of duty location, have access to the information they need to be 
successful. These tools will also support cadre management personnel in building a culture that 
prioritizes readiness and increases trust between all members of their respective cadres. FEMA 
aims to foster open lines of communication between senior leadership, management, and cadre 
members/employees, which will further contribute to the overall readiness and ability to respond 
as an agency. 

While FEMA’s distributed workforce will likely challenge Cadre Coordinators’ ability to reach 
their respective incident workforce members, a varied communications strategy will assist them 
in leading all members of their team. To the greatest degree possible, all communication media 
should utilize, as necessary, alternative formats and other accommodation measures to ensure 
that cadre members have equal access to communications. 

Data Sharing 
As described in the previous chapter, IWMD will assist all cadres in measuring their collective 
readiness through the development and distribution of the CORDS report. IWMD will also 
provide each Cadre Coordinator individual readiness data. The individual readiness data will 
provide availability, training, qualification, and equipment status of each member of their cadre. 

This data will provide the Cadre Coordinator with an accurate picture of their cadre without 
requiring cadre management personnel to access multiple tools and databases. It will serve as a

ready reference of each employee’s readiness to deploy, and will help Cadre Coordinators 
provide guidance and direction to each of their cadre members as they move through the training 
and qualification process. In addition, the individual readiness report will help Cadre 
Coordinators plan for the future needs of their cadre. It will allow Cadre Coordinators or Cadre 
Training Managers to identify common training and educational requirements and help enable 
them to prioritize course development or execution. 

IWMD will maintain a system of record that captures readiness data pertaining to the incident 
workforce. When necessary, IWMD will ensure these systems interface with those of other 
divisions, directorates, and regions (IWM Liaison Teams) to ensure an accurate picture of 
readiness can be established. 

Cross Cadre Collaboration 
In addition to regularly convening the CCWG, IWMD will support collaboration across cadres 
by maintaining a cadre management SharePoint site. The site, accessible to all cadre 
management personnel and members of the incident workforce, will house all policy and 
guidance documents, memos, manuals, and standard operating procedures pertinent to the 
incident workforce. The site will also house contact information of all cadre management 
personnel. IWMD will update the SharePoint site regularly and will communicate changes to the 
site to all stakeholders. 

Separate from formal meetings of the CCWG, IWMD will host twice-monthly cadre 
management coordination calls to support day-to-day collaboration. These meetings will be open 
to all cadre management personnel including Cadre Coordinators, RPMs, FTE Coordinators, IM 
CORE Program Managers, Cadre Training Managers, and Regional IWM Liaison Team 
members. IWMD will schedule meetings, ensure dial-in capability is provided, distribute the 
agenda, and capture key discussion items for distribution to the group. If recurring issues are 
identified during these collaborative meetings, IWMD will ensure they are formally considered 
by the CCWG.  

Cadre Governance and Oversight 

IWMD will ensure decisions made by the IWESC or CCWG are shared with the leadership of 
each cadre and regional stakeholders. The Director of IWMD, as the Chairman of the CCWG, 
will provide a summary of CCWG discussions to all CAs, COs, and Cadre Coordinators. The 
Director will also ensure issues identified by the CCWG that require the attention of the IWESC 
are conveyed to the DDO as the Chairman of the IWESC. In addition, the Director of IWMD, 
will distribute a summary of decisions from any IWESC meeting to all CAs, COs, and Cadre 
Coordinators. Cadre Coordinators should share information on any changes with their staff.

Pasadena Call Center 

IWMD will maintain a Call Center in Region IX, which will remain a point of engagement for 
FEMA employees. The Pasadena Call Center will remain open Monday-Friday to handle 
questions pertaining to any incident workforce issues.  

Coordination/Communication with Cadre Members 
All Cadre Coordinators, RPMs, FTE Coordinators, Cadre Training Managers, IM CORE 
Program Managers, and Regional IWM Liaison teams, as applicable, will regularly communicate 
with each other and the individual employees of their cadre. As changes in policy or procedure 
affecting the incident workforce occur, and/or if an incident requiring the deployment of a large 
portion of the cadre takes place, cadre management personnel will communicate those changes to 
all cadre members in a timely manner. They will use a variety of communication methods to 
ensure information is passed effectively, including email blasts, quarterly teleconferences, mass 
mailings, and personal phone calls. Cadre management personnel will maintain accurate records 
of contact information for all members of their cadre. This communication should include 
messages to the entire cadre as well as individual outreach. 

Cadre management personnel will endeavor to reach all personnel within their cadre individually 
to address their specific concerns. At least annually, each Cadre Coordinator, or RPM, FTE 
Coordinator, and IM CORE Program Manager, as applicable, will call every cadre member to 
validate the individual readiness data. If that information is not accurate, the Cadre Coordinator 
will record the discrepancy and take appropriate actions to correct the information. This may 
include gathering training certificates to update the employee’s training record or collecting 
equipment barcodes. The Cadre Coordinator will then convey that information to IWMD so that 
it can be corrected in the appropriate data system. 

Annual Individual Readiness Cadre Call 
All Cadre Coordinators, RPMs, FTE Coordinators, and IM CORE Program Managers, as 
applicable, will contact each cadre member individually on at least an annual basis, in addition to 
regular outreach and communication actions. The call should be geared towards policy updates, 
program changes, problem solving, lessons learned, and best practices, not just as a status check. 
Following are the steps involved in conducting annual individual readiness cadre calls: 

Preparation 

1.  E-mail communication to all cadre members announcing period of time when call will be 

conducted 

a.  Include information regarding the nature of the call 
b.  Inform cadre members of any information they will be asked to provide on the 

call (e.g., equipment serial numbers, availability status, etc.) 

2.  Review individual readiness data and make sure contact information for each employee is 

available

3.  If any information will be requested on the call, ensure form is developed to capture 

information. Coordinate form with IWMD to ensure information collected can be input in 
the relevant system following the calls. 

During Call 

1.  Review individual readiness data with the cadre member and validate information on file 

a.  Make sure contact information for each employee is accurate 
b.  Make sure training and qualification status is accurate 
c.  Review performance evaluations on file, if applicable 

2.  Record any discrepancies in employee’s file 
3.  Keep track of length of call with each Reservist to ensure compensation in accordance 

with the Fair Labor Standards Act 

4.  Answer any questions the cadre member has and make note of any additional follow-on 

actions 

Following the Call 

1.  Pass any corrections in the employee’s individual readiness data to IWMD for correction 

in the system of record 

2.  Update cadre rosters or contact information documents as necessary 
3.  Follow-up on any additional requests 

Quarterly Cadre Coordination Call 
Cadre Coordinators have funding for Reservist participation up to 32 hours per year, eight hours 
per quarter, in order to coordinate with their cadre members via quarterly call. The procedures 
for this call are noted below. When desired, Cadre Coordinators can utilize additional tools such 
as Adobe Connect to support this call. Detailed instructions for setting up webinars through 
Adobe Connect can be found on the FEMA intranet at: 
http://on.fema.net/employee_tools/it_tools/esd/Pages/adobeconnect.aspx. 

Preparation 

1.  E-mail communication to all cadre members announcing call 

a.  Include RSVP instructions, especially for Reservists so that their time can be 

accounted for 

b.  Include meeting agenda with a precise purpose of the call noted 
c.  Consider having call captioned 

2.  For Reservists, identify a “timekeeper” in WebTA 
3.  Evaluate each Reservist’s WebTA profile and ensure they are currently active in the 
system to process their WebTA. With FEMA’s newly implemented process, non-
deployed status Reservists in the deployment system have their WebTA profiles 
automatically deactivated.

Certification: The validation and affirmation of the qualifications process for a FEMA FQS 
position. 

Certifying Authority (CA): The CA is the highest-ranking FEMA official—Assistant 
Administrator equivalent or higher—for the cadre. The CA may delegate FQS authority (in 
accordance with the FQS Guide) and cadre management authorities to the Certifying Official 
and/or Cadre Coordinator, but ultimately bears responsibility for the effective management and 
performance of the cadre. 

Certifying Official (CO): The CO is designated by the CA to manage FQS for a specific 
incident workforce cadre, including having the authority from the CA to issue PTBs and certify 
individuals for specific FQS positions. The CO cannot delegate this authority. 

Coach-Evaluator: An individual certified by FEMA as an evaluator who is qualified in the 
position being evaluated and is assigned at an incident to mentor and/or evaluate a 
trainee’s/candidate’s performance. For tasks completed in a simulated environment (classroom, 
exercise, or simulation), successful completion of each task is documented by the instructor or 
assigned evaluator. A coach-evaluator is usually the same person providing instruction as a 
“coach” and subsequently evaluating the performance as an “evaluator.” 

Decertification: The process of rescinding an FQS qualification of an individual.

Deployment: The movement of personnel based on official orders to a temporary duty station to 
fulfill incident management or support requirements, including training related to those duties. 

Director of Disaster Operations (DDO): A senior FEMA official designated by the FEMA 
Administrator to coordinate and synchronize all headquarters activities for credible threats as 
well as during major disaster or emergency activations. The DDO provides operational guidance 
and direction to the Chief of the National Response Coordination Staff. 

FEMA Qualification System (FQS): A performance-based system for certifying FEMA 
employees as “Qualified” or “Trainee” in incident management and incident support positions; 
certification is based on successful completion of required experience, required training, and 
demonstrated performance. 

Final Evaluator: The official responsible for signing the verification statement that all tasks 
have been certified in a trainee’s/candidate’s PTB by an evaluator and recommending that the 
trainee/candidate be considered for certification in the position. 

Force Package: A predefined, standardized grouping of teams, personnel, and/or equipment to 
provide a specific programmatic or operational function. 

Force Strength: The actual number of members in FEMA’s incident workforce cadres who are 
qualified or trainees, and who are equipped for deployment. 

Force Structure: A FEMA model that establishes incident personnel staffing requirements 
based on analysis of historical deployment data, readiness requirements, and likely future 
conditions. 

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employee: Includes PFT Employees, TFT Employees, and 
COREs. 

Incident Command System (ICS): A standardized on-scene emergency management construct 
specifically designed to provide an integrated organizational structure that reflects the 
complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents, without being hindered by jurisdictional 
boundaries. ICS is the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and 
communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the 
management of resources during incidents. It is used for all kinds of emergencies and is 
applicable to small as well as large and complex incidents. ICS is used by various jurisdictions 
and functional agencies, both public and private, to organize field-level incident management 
operations. 

Incident Level: The level for which control of FEMA incident operations, including the Federal 
resources deployed to an incident and the establishment of a Unified Coordination Group, is 
delegated to the FCO or Federal Resource Coordinator.

Incident Management: The incident-level operation of the Federal role in emergency response, 
recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities include the direct control and employment of 
resources, management of incident offices, operations, and delivery of Federal assistance through 
all phases of response and recovery. 

Incident Management COREs (IM COREs): A CORE whose primary job duty is to perform 
an FQS incident management position above all other potential assignments.  

Incident Management and Support Keystone: A FEMA document that establishes the 
foundational doctrine that guides FEMA’s conduct of incident operations, including those 
undertaken based on a threat, in anticipation of or preparation for a significant event, or in 
response to an incident that has already occurred. 

Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT): A NIMS/ICS-compliant, self-sufficient, 
highly mobile, rapidly deployable emergency response team organized and equipped to 
effectively manage all Federal support to a State, local, tribal, or territorial government during 
natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other man-made disasters. For Stafford Act incidents, the 
primary mission of an IMAT is to organize and manage a coordinated and successful response 
and recovery operation to meet the emergent needs of State and local jurisdictions. 

Incident Management Typed Positions: Positions for which different qualification levels called 
types have been established that reflect the size and complexity of the incident, based on FEMA 
incident levels, in which the employee is required to perform. Typed positions include FCOs and 
Command and General Staff positions, which are typed at levels I, II, and III to coincide with 
Level I, II, and III incidents; Branch Director positions are typed at levels I and II. An employee 
who is qualified for a typed position may fill his/her position in any incident level at or below 
his/her type. For example, type I staff members may be assigned to level I, II, or III incidents; 
type III employees may not be assigned to level I or II incidents (except as a trainee/candidate 
for a higher typed position). 

Incident Support: The coordination of all Federal resources that support emergency response, 
recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities include the deployment of national-level 
assets, support of national objectives and programs affected during the incident, and support of 
incident operations with resources, expertise, information, and guidance. 

Incident Workforce: Individuals assigned to perform disaster-related duties in FEMA incident 
operations. 

Position Qualification Sheet: A written document that identifies required experience, training, 
and external certification (if any) for a given position. 

Position Task Book (PTB): A document that lists the critical behaviors, activities, and tasks 
required to become certified for a given incident management or incident support position within

FQS; successful completion of all tasks in the PTB, as determined by an authorized FQS 
evaluator, is the basis for recommending a trainee or candidate for certification. 

Program: The FEMA component or office with authority for and oversight of the functions for 
which a particular cadre is responsible. 

Qualifications Review Board (QRB): A group convened to evaluate employees’ qualifications 
against established standards and provide fair and consistent recommendations for certification 
(including recertification or decertification). 

Qualified: An individual who has met qualification requirements under FQS and received a 
qualification letter from his or her Certifying Authority. 

Readiness: The condition of an individual, team, group, or organization that demonstrates their 
ability to meet a designated assignment. 

Recertification: The process of reinstating the qualifications and certification of an employee.

to direct that employee on all matters relating, but not limited to, assignment and evaluation of 
work, administration, training, property accountability, and to discipline or terminate the 
employee. 

Temporary Duty Supervisor: The manager under whose supervision a deployed employee will 
work. 

Temporary Full Time (TFT): An employee assigned a full-time work schedule and provided 
either a term appointment under 5 C.F.R. Part 316, subpart C or a permanent appointment under 5 
C.F.R. § 213.3102(c).

APPENDIX A: GUIDANCE FOR WORKING AT THE 
RESIDENCE OF RECORD OR AT AN ALTERNATE 
LOCATION WHEN ON TEMPORARY DUTY 

1.  Work may not be performed from these locations if the work involves classified materials 

and/or requires daily face-to-face contact. 

2.  Information that is For Official Use Only may be accessed using employee-owned 

equipment and may only be saved on government-issued equipment.  

3.  Performance will be evaluated consistent with FEMA policy on Performance 

Management. 

4.  Expected work hours must be established in advance. Any work that would result in 

premium or overtime pay must be ordered and approved in advance in accordance with 
FEMA Manual 253.2-1 FEMA Premium Pay Manual. 

5.  An employee is covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act at either of these 
worksites as long as the injury occurred while performing his/her official duties and in 
the designated work area approved by the Cadre Coordinator/functional supervisor. If an 
injury occurs, the employee must notify the supervisor of record (and temporary duty 
supervisor, if applicable) immediately, provide the details of the accident or injury, and 
complete Department of Labor CA-1, Federal Employee’s Notice of Traumatic Injury 
and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation. The government is not liable for 
damages to the employee’s personal or real property while the employee is working in 
either of these locations, except to the extent the government is held liable under the 
Federal Tort Claims Act or the Military and Civilian Employees Claims Act. 

6.  For Reservist or IM CORE working from the residence of record: 

a.  For Reservists: Certain discrete, disaster related tasks and activities may be 

suitable for completion from the official duty station, when it is the residence of 
record. The CO will define the positions, if applicable, in his/her cadre that are 
authorized to complete work from home. For these authorized positions, the 
Reservist’s RPM, or Cadre Coordinator if no RPM exists, must approve the 
completion of the task and ensure that the Reservist has been issued the proper 
equipment to perform the task. For IM COREs: The supervisor of record has 
broad discretion to assign work to be completed from the residence of record but 
must provide proper supervisory oversight. 

b.  Prior to approval of any work at the residence of record, the employee must 

affirm to his/her supervisor of record that the residence of record is free from 
hazards and a safe environment in which to perform the assigned tasks(s); that the

employee will arrange for dependent care during the completion of the task (if 
applicable); and that he/she understands that the Government will not be 
responsible for any operating costs that are associated with the use of the 
employee’s residence of record as an official worksite. The employee should refer 
to FEMA Form 123-9-0-2, Certification of Health and Safety Checklist when 
determining if his/her residence of record is free from hazards, but is not required 
to complete and submit the checklist to his/her supervisor of record. If the 
employee cannot agree to these conditions or the supervisor of record learns that 
the employee is not properly equipped to complete the requisite task, the 
supervisor of record must assign the task to a different employee. 

c.  Reservists and IM COREs who have already on-boarded at the time of publication 
of this policy whose position has been authorized for telework by their CO and 
who have completed a telework documentation package, in compliance with 
FEMA Manual 123-9-1, need not complete the preceding steps, despite the reality 
that working from their official duty station is not telework if their official duty 
station is their residence of record. 

d.  IM COREs and Reservists who are activated for training, cadre coordination 

meetings, or to update their equipment from their official duty station, when it is 
the residence of record, need not complete the preceding steps. 

All employees who are deployed are on official travel, which is excluded from the definition of 
“telework” in the Telework Enhancement Act, OPM guidance and FEMA Manual 123-9-1 
FEMA Telework Policy. 

1.  Even though not considered to be “telework,” the following reasons may support 

approval of work at an alternative location while deployed, such as in a hotel room: (1) 
the employee has a need for uninterrupted time of five working days or fewer to complete 
work on a complex project or report; (2) an employee is recovering from an injury or 
illness, such as a contagious disease, and is temporarily unable to physically report to the 
temporary duty station, but is still able to work; or (3) the temporary duty station to 
which the employee is assigned is temporarily closed or inaccessible.10 If the employee 
has a need for uninterrupted time of more than five work days to complete work on a 
complex project or report, the employee’s temporary duty station supervisor must obtain 
approval from his/her Branch Chief prior to the employee commencing work at the 
alternative location. 

2.  The employee must have the proper equipment to complete the assigned duties. 

10 Working from a deployed employee’s TDY lodging may be appropriate in lieu of administrative leave in 
circumstances where the temporary duty station is closed or inaccessible. See FM 253-4-1 for additional guidance 
on administrative leave for Reservists. Consult with OCCHCO for additional guidance on administrative leave for 
other appointment types.

3.  The employee’s temporary duty station supervisor must determine that working from the 

alternative location is appropriate for mission requirements and must clearly 
communicate expectations for completion of the tasks and the hours of work. 

4.  The temporary duty supervisor may modify the work arrangement or direct the employee 
to return to the temporary duty station to complete the task for any reason, including 
when the supervisor has determined that the employee is not performing the task 
according to expectations. In such circumstances, the supervisor should document this 
poor performance and include this feedback in the employee’s deployment evaluation, 
coordinating with the employee’s supervisor of record and OCCHCO as necessary. 

5.  This policy does not apply to circumstances in which deployed personnel perform mobile 
work, i.e., routine and regular travel to conduct work in other worksites as opposed to a 
single authorized alternative worksite. One form of mobile work on TDY is commonly 
known as “field work,” in which a deployed employee performs work in various 
locations in support of Stafford Act activities and does not regularly work at a temporary, 
fixed facility.

APPENDIX B: SYSTEMS APPROACH TO TRAINING11 

A Systems Approach to Training Management 
Cadre training programs must pursue incident requirements while also meeting personnel and 
fiscal requirements. High personnel tempo, increased operational tempo, and decreased funding 
combine to present FEMA leaders at all levels with real challenges that directly impact 
operational readiness. Regardless of the challenges, all must continue to meet their mission 
requirements. 

Training management focuses training on the tasks essential to a cadre’s incident capabilities in a 
manner that maximizes results and focuses priorities. Training management relies on a systems 
approach to training (SAT) to incorporate FEMA training principles into course curricula, SAT 
is a systematic and problem solving model used to effectively develop FEMA’s entire incident 
workforce training. 

The SAT recognizes that proficiency cannot be achieved and sustained on every possible training 
task – FEMA has neither the funds nor the time for such an endeavor. As a result, SAT provides 
needed training management techniques to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate 
performance-oriented training. It guides cadre managers and unit leaders in the use of scarce 
resources by identifying critical incident tasks and determining where resources are needed most 
to maintain readiness. Both formal schools and operational units can apply the SAT to improve 
operational efficiency and maintain readiness. For instance, if applied in a formal school setting, 
a program of instruction is generated; in an operational unit/team, a short-range training plan is 
generated. 

No matter how it is applied, the SAT process, in regard to training management, consists of five 
phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. 

11 Additional guidance is currently under development by OCCHCO.

Figure 8: SAT Process 

System Phases 
Analysis 

The Analysis Phase provides a method of responding to changes in resource requirements, 
solving mission performance problems, and learning from “real world” experience. In the 
analysis phase, detailed practical studies are performed to determine the incident tasks or areas 
that require instruction, the learning characteristics of the training audience, the cost-
effectiveness of a selected delivery system (e.g., technology based training ), and the scope, 
timeline, and budget of a training project/program. These facts are gathered to make informed 
training development decisions and provide the linkage between mission and the training 
program. The following types of analysis may be completed: 

•  Needs or Performance Analysis 
•  Audience or Learner Characteristics Analysis 
•  Mission/Task Analysis 
•  Skill/Knowledge (Competency) Analysis 
•  Content, Learning, and/or Instructional Analysis 

Design 

The Design Phase uses the performance information collected in the analysis phase to help the 
training project or program take shape. The information gathered specifies, in measurable terms, 
the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes the training will develop. This phase will lead to the creation 
of learning objectives, which are developed for groups of related knowledge and skills. These

written statements of learning outcomes define exactly when, what, and how well the learner 
must perform during training. Defining how individual tasks are performed focuses training 
development efforts. In addition, the information gathered permits more effective decisions 
regarding such things as: 

•  How the training materials will be organized and presented 
•  Which training activities and instructional strategies will be included 
•  How much time will be spent on each topic 
•  How to use presentation media 
•  How incident workforce members will be evaluated 

The design phase will also consider how to best measure the achievement of course objectives. 
Evaluation instruments (practical measures as well as written/knowledge tests) will be produced 
to ensure that learning objectives are achieved and competencies are reliably evaluated. 

Development 

The Development Phase organizes the instructional materials needed for incident workforce 
members to achieve the learning objectives. Activities are defined and these activities describe 
how the instructor and the incident workforce member will perform during training to achieve 
the learning objectives. Emphasis is on maximizing the use of existing materials and resources. 
Existing suitable training materials and lesson plans are selected and new ones produced as 
needed. Resulting training materials are reviewed for technical accuracy, tried out using a focus 
group, and revised as necessary. Standards-based, performance-oriented training materials are 
the products of this phase. 

Implementation 

The Implementation Phase is the process of putting the training project/program into operation. 
In this phase, the finalized training is ready to be delivered to the target audience. If the training 
is to be instructor-led or facilitated, instructors are selected and trained usually with a train-the-
trainer session. Training is delivered as planned, and cadre member and instructor performance is 
evaluated. These evaluations serve two purposes. First, they verify that learners have achieved 
the learning objectives. Second, incident workforce member evaluation results and instructor 
comments are useful for future program revisions and follow-up evaluation. 

Evaluation 

The Evaluation Phase (or Control Phase) ensures the training project or program’s continuing 
ability to produce qualified incident workforce members. A follow-up evaluation is conducted to 
get an assessment of how well the training prepared the incident workforce member to perform 
their mission in the field/at the incident level, for a period of time. Evaluation is the dynamic 
process of assessing performance, identifying concerns, and initiating corrective actions. Data

sources for evaluation often include surveys, interviews, tests, course evaluation results, service 
or product data, and observations. 

The SAT process is an effective and efficient tool (not a program) used to control the mission 
training and requirements. It provides Cadre Coordinators/leaders/trainers with the training 
management techniques they need to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate 
performance-oriented training. The application of SAT and training principles to cadre training 
occurs at all levels. Its most important product is the cadre’s METL. The METL becomes the 
cadre’s unique focus for effective and efficient training. Once a cadre’s METL is developed, 
training priorities can be set and resources allocated based on how well the unit executes its 
METL tasks and the related collective and individual tasks drawn from the mission performance 
standards.

APPENDIX G: PROCESSES FOR ASSIGNMENT OF A 
FQS JOB TITLE 

The process for initial assignment for Reservists and IM COREs is shorter as they were hired 
directly into their incident management positions. The FTEs normally fill a different steady-state 
role, and therefore, have more requirements in obtaining their initial assignment for their incident 
management role. 

Initial Assignment 

Reservist 
The process is: 

1.  The Cadre Coordinator is notified, by OCCHCO, when a new employee is on-boarded 

and in process through Human Resources. 

2.  The cadre management will assign an initial FQS job title and the proficiency based upon 

the new employee's experience. 

o  An FQS Transmittal Log (FTL) is NOT required for new hires. However, a letter, 
similar to the Certification Letter (available on the Resource Management Branch 
SharePoint), should be created and sent to the FEMA-FQS-
Program@fema.dhs.gov e-mail to initiate entry into the deployment system and 
the qualification tracking system. 

o  If the Reservist is qualified, a PTB for their position will be sent with the letter as 

a reference. 

o  If the Reservist is not qualified (trainee or candidate), a PTB will be sent with the 

letter. 

IM CORE 
The process is: 

1.  The Cadre Coordinator is notified by OCCHCO when a new employee is onboarded and 

in process through Human Resources. 

2.  The cadre management will assign an initial FQS job title and the proficiency based upon 
the new employee's experience. Typically, IM CORE and IMAT new employees are 
hired into specific positions.  

3.  An FTL is NOT required for new hires. However, a letter, similar to the Certification 

Letter (available on the RMB SharePoint), should be created and sent to the FEMA-FQS-
Program@fema.dhs.gov e-mail to initiate entry into the deployment system and the 
qualification tracking system.

o  If the IM CORE/IMAT is qualified, a PTB for their position will be sent with the 

letter as a reference. 

o  If the IM CORE/IMAT is not qualified (trainee or candidate), a PTB will be sent 

with the letter. 

FTE 
The process is: 

1.  The FTE completes ERF or ERF – QRB and obtains Supervisor's signature as approval 

that the employee is available to deploy. The FTE submits ERF and supporting 
documentation listed on the instructions of the form to FEMA-FQS-
Program@fema.dhs.gov. Supporting documentation includes: 
a.  Deployment History from the deployment system 
b.  Supplemental Incident Deployment Experience including personal records such 

Incident Performance Appraisal(s) 

as: 
I. 
II.  Verification letter from section chief or senior leadership

APPENDIX I: RESERVIST EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE 

In all cases Reservist 1-1-1 equipment will be fund code 06 (disaster) properties. 

• 
•  Funding for airtime of the telecom services for Reservist is funded through fund code 06. 
•  Standard equipment issue for Reservist members is 1-1-1 (laptop, phone, RSA token) 

purchased with fund code 06. 

•  Any other equipment in addition to fund code 06 (1-1-1) needs to be funded and issued 

• 

by the designated cadre. 
If the cadre wishes to pay for an upgrade this should be coordinated by the Cadre 
Manager through IT Telecom Services to provide all the pertinent funding information 
for this request. Reservist Program cannot authorize the UPGRADE to an IPHONE until 
the Blackberry stock has been depleted, the issuing APO should continue issuing what 
has been purchased and is currently stored. 
IPADS are authorized by FQS job title. 

• 
•  Requesting Reservist equipment: local issuing APO should coordinate request(s) through 
IT coordinator via Network Inventory and Optimization Solution (NiOS) for Disaster 
Information Systems Clearinghouse (DISC) and Mobility Service Center (MSC) related 
equipment.  

•  Scenario I: New Reservist member; Reservist member may receive equipment at JFO or 

Regional office following the 1-1-1 Equipment standard operating procedures. 

•  Scenario II: Existing Reservist member with fund code 06 (disaster) equipment; issuing 
APO should execute a Hand Receipt (FEMA Form 119-7-1-3), Custody Receipt for 
Government Property (FEMA Form 119-7-1-3A) and complete property transfer to 
established CADRE Site Code. Documentation with signatures should be scanned and e-
mailed to CADRE site code designated APO. 

Malfunctioning Equipment Guidance for Reservists

will be guided to a local FEMA office when available to them to correct the issue. 
If IT Tech determines the equipment (laptop) cannot be fixed and new equipment needs 
to be issued; pending funding, laptops can be shipped to an employee’s residence but 
initial setup and authentication of the new equipment with employee must be done behind 
the FEMA firewall on FEMA (hard wired) network.

Reservist at Home with Malfunctioning Equipment (Phone) 

•  Call ESD 888-457-3362 to have IT Tech troubleshoot the issue. Individual must obtain 

• 

the remedy ticket number from IT Tech. 
If the IT Tech determines the equipment (phone) cannot be fixed, the individual would 
then send email to APO and carbon copy the cadre manager with the remedy ticket 
number, included an explanation of issue and the IT Tech recommendation. 
•  Cadre Manager would then coordinate with the local IT coordinator to place an 

equipment request through NIOS for a replacement phone. The new phone must be 
shipped/delivered to APO at the following address 

o  ATTN: Designated APO 
o  Property Management Division 
o  430 Market Street 
o  Winchester, VA 22603 

•  Once this information has been validated the Reservist APO will re-issue the new phone 
and request the individual sign all pertinent documentation prior to the new equipment 
being shipped. 

•  Pending funding, once APO receives signed documentation, APO will ship via UPS to 
the address provided by the individual. Also included will be a return UPS label for the 
return of malfunctioning equipment (phone) 

•  When a member receives equipment they should then contact ESD (888)457-3362 or 

MSC (540)-678-2245 to activate and set up phone for use.

Cadre Coordinators, RPMs, IM CORE Program Managers, Cadre Training Managers, and FTE 
Coordinators must support a number of administrative functions to assist their cadre members in 
arranging travel, pay, availability, and reasonable accommodations. The procedures for 
completing these processes change frequently, as do the specific points of contact. FEMA has 
therefore established a SharePoint site, which includes accurate, up-to-date references for these 
administrative functions. Specifically, the site contains: 

•  Process diagram for Reservist WebTA processing 
•  Process diagram for IM Core WebTA processing 
•  Funding of IM Core travel 
•  Funding for Reservist travel 
•  Additional administrative materials as required 

The SharePoint site is updated regularly and maintained by IWMD. It can be found at:

APPENDIX S: WORKFORCE ANALYSIS 

The workforce analysis includes the following five tasks: 

1.  Develop a work plan, goals, and objectives 

a.  The work plan will include doctrine and document research, an examination of 

historic and current data, and interviews with cadre management. IWMD will use 
a systems approach to determine the shortfalls associated with the current force 
structure and develop possible solutions for the future force structure. 
2.  Conduct a comprehensive force structure model review and mission analysis across all 

cadres 

a.  Analyze cadre staffing levels and positions, and assess the capacity of the cadres 

to respond to an incident. The analysis will identify: the percentage of the 
permanent workforce required to perform incident management/incident support 
duties as compared to those who will hold ancillary and mission essential 
positions; total number of workforce members who hold positions solely 
dedicated to incident response (i.e., IM COREs, FEMA Corps); the Reservist 
incident responder requirement to provide for a scalable incident response using a 
temporary, intermittent workforce; and finally the SCF, which allows FEMA to 
leverage the Federal interagency workforce in response to a catastrophic Level I, 
or simultaneous incidents exceeding FEMA’s organic incident responder 
capacity. It should be noted that the FEMA Corps members and SCF volunteers 
will not be counted into force structure calculations. 

b.  Identify deficiencies or redundancies within the incident workforce in conducting 
the Federal response to incidents as determined through the review of relevant 
Federal Interagency Operations Plans, conducting interviews, reviewing regional 
incident staffing needs, and reviewing other sources as necessary. 

3.  Examine future technology 

a.  Determine critical force package deployment architecture for response through 

analysis of existing data, requirement needs, and projected deployment template 
strategies. 

4.  Examine training, education, and qualification needs 

a.  Examine needed future training courses, other types of developmental education, 

and necessary qualifications against existing standards in the FEMA 
Qualifications System. 

5.  Explore mitigation efforts 

a.  Conduct outreach with mitigation to determine if and how hazard mitigation 

efforts have decreased Federal response and recovery requirements for certain 
incidents.

APPENDIX T: OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL 

Unlike every other division and office in the Agency, FEMA’s Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) 
provides legal advice to FEMA’s Administrator and Agency staff under the direct supervision of 
the DHS General Counsel.15 The General Counsel is the Department's chief legal officer and 
principal legal advisor to the Secretary of Homeland Security and, as such, has final authority 
and responsibility for legal policy determinations within the Department as well as its 
components (including FEMA). 

As the employees of FEMA’s OCC report to the General Counsel, they are subject to the policies 
of governance established by the General Counsel. As employees of the General Counsel, DHS 
Delegation 0400.2 “Delegation to the General Counsel” establishes the Office of the General 
Counsel as an organizational element for the purposes of appointment and administration of 
personnel, claims resolution, and the labor-management relations program. The General Counsel, 
with the concurrence of the Secretary, may determine that the Office of the General Counsel 
shall operate with other authorities and responsibilities of an organizational element, in 
accordance with Delegation 0160.1 “Delegation to the Department of Homeland Security 
Organizational Elements.” Pursuant to that authority, the General Counsel has retained the 
authority to select, assign, reassign, classify, deploy, and discipline OCC personnel.  

The control over FEMA attorneys by the General Counsel is in part because attorneys are subject 
to ethics and oversight responsibilities that other employees are not. State Bar membership is 
essential to the statutory duties and responsibilities of the attorneys of the Agency. Each 
employee who reports to the General Counsel and who is appointed to an 0905 (General 
Attorney) occupational series attorney position, must, at the time of appointment and throughout 
his or her tenure, be an active member in good standing of the Bar of at least one United States 
jurisdiction, which is any State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or commonwealth of the 
United States. In addition, he or she must comply with applicable local ethics codes in addition 
to all ethics codes for Federal attorneys. Failure to maintain current, active membership in good 
standing may be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal service. 

As such, OCC employees may not be selected, assigned, deployed, or disciplined by offices 
outside OCC. This includes attorneys whose positions are funded by other FEMA offices, as well 
as attorneys whose duty stations may be co-located with regional cadres. 

Due to the restrictions on OCC, some of the provisions of this guide do not pertain to OCC 
personnel. Please see the Associate Chief Counsel for Regional and Field Legal Operations for 
questions regarding the applicability of Cadre Management procedures to OCC personnel.
