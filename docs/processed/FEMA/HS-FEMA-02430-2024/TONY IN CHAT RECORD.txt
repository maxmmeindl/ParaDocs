Morning T, would be great to have some work to do... just saying.  Hoping all is well with you and yours.  Should be interesting moving forward, daughter moves home later today, with 2 cats to add to one dog and one cat.. hoping her healing will go well... anyway... any identified path forward?  and thanks for everything Tony, I really appreciate it.
 At this time please continue to work with the Close Out team.

if you are able to deploy me, keep it close for the initial time to see how things go here at home, then we can go out further..
7/9 6:33 AM
Meindl, Max
‚òï   3"-4" limbs down everywhere, 3 windows blown out, fence down.. other than that .. all is good..

Meindl, Max
so this year... an ice storm, a tornado and a hurricane... darn dude.. owning a house brings its own excitement...
7/9 10:02 AM
Meindl, Max
It is very hard to understand why you aren't allowed to deploy me when the need is stipulated by the FEMA Administrator.. I.E. You Are Needed More Than Ever.  None of this is making any sense Tony, just saying.
7/9 10:44 AM
Meindl, Max
It takes all of us to deliver our mission effectively, and I thank you for being willing to deploy when needed. Together, we will rise to the challenges this season may bring.  Sincerely,  Deanne
7/9 10:52 AM
