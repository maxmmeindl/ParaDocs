          Level 1-7  1250 Points

Comprehensive knowledge of agency goals and objectives, structure, mission, and programs and 
knowledge of qualitative methods sufficient to solve problems and challenges of considerable 
scope.   

 
 
Comprehensive knowledge of technical advice and guidance to the agency concerning recovery 
issues and evaluation of major administrative aspects of substantive, mission-oriented programs.  
Ability to provide technical advice and assistance on quality assistance and process improvement 
practices in relation to recovery services to disaster victims.  Provides guidance to internal and 
external customers concerning complex, unusual, or unprecedented recovery management 
initiatives.

Knowledge and skill in applying a wide range of analytical and evaluative methods and 
qualitative analysis methods, concepts, and practices, sufficient to perform efficiency and 
effectiveness evaluations of programs, or substantive administrative support functions.  
Knowledge is used to plan, schedule, and conduct projects and studies to evaluate and 
recommend ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of work operations in a program or 
support setting. 

Intensive, practical knowledge and skills to analyze and evaluate difficult issues involving the 
substantive nature of agency programs and activities; agency missions, issues, policies, and 
objectives; management principles and processes; and the analytical and evaluative methods and 
techniques for assessing program development or execution and improving organizational 
efficiency.  

Knowledge of pertinent laws, regulations, policies and precedents which affect the use of 
program and related support resources (people, money, or equipment) in the area studied. 

Extensive knowledge of technical recovery issues, program goals and objectives, work 
processes, and FEMA administrative operations in order to evaluate major administrative aspects 
of substantive, mission-oriented programs.   

Ability to provide technical advice and assistance on engineering and construction management 
practices in relation to recovery services to disaster victims.  Provides guidance to internal and 
external customers concerning complex, unusual, or unprecedented recovery emergency 
management initiatives. 

The work requires skill in the application of fact-finding and investigative techniques; oral and 
written communications; and development of presentations and reports.  There is the need to 
convey policy and concepts to technical and non-technical managers, project partners, and other 
germane parties with demonstrated clarity, logic, conciseness, and persuasiveness in obtaining 
the cooperation of others while defending findings to peers and management officials. 

Factor 2.  Supervisory Controls.  

Level 2-4  450 points 

Within a framework of priorities, funding and overall work objectives, the employee and 
supervisor develop a mutually acceptable work plan which typically includes identification of the 
work to be done, the scope of the project, and deadlines for its completion. 

Within the parameters of the approved work plan, the employee is responsible for planning and 
organizing the work, estimating costs, coordinating with staff and line management personnel, 

 
 
 
 
 
and conducting all phases of the project.  This frequently involves the definitive interpretation of 
regulations and study procedures, and the initial application of new methods.  Informs the 
supervisor of potentially controversial findings, issues, or problems with widespread impact.  

Completed work, evaluations, reports, or recommendations are reviewed by the supervisor for 
compatibility with organizational goals, guidelines, and effectiveness in achieving intended 
objectives.  Completed work is also reviewed critically outside the employee's immediate office 
by staff and line management officials whose programs and employees would be affected by 
implementation of the recommendations.   

Factor 3. Guidelines.  

Level 3-4  450 points 

The work requires extensive knowledge of emergency management and related directives, 
policies, and laws.  Standards and guidance include, but are not limited to National Security 
Strategy, PPD-8, Homeland Security Presidential Directives, National Mitigation Framework, 
and National Incident Management System.  Uses guidelines such as general administrative 
policies and management and organizational theories which require considerable adaptation 
and/or interpretation for application to issues and problems studied.  Administrative policies and 
precedent studies provide a basic outline of the results desired, but do not go into detail as to the 
methods used to accomplish the project.  Administrative guidelines typically cover program 
goals and objectives of the employing organization, such as agency controls on size of work 
force, productivity targets, and similar objectives.  Within the context of broad guidelines the 
employee may refine or develop more specific guidelines such as implementing regulations or 
methods for the measurement and improvement of effectiveness and productivity in the 
administration of operating programs. 

Factor 4. Complexity. 

Level 4-4  225 points

Executes emergency recovery program operations, and ensures functional responsibilities are 
carried out under the authority of the Stafford Act, as amended, and PPD-8, which results in the 
delivery of effective recovery support services to disaster-impacted Federal, State, local, tribal, 
territorial, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.  Options, recommendations, 
and conclusions developed by the employee take into account and give appropriate weight to 
uncertainties about the data and other variables which affect long-range program performance.
The work requires detailed planning to conduct information gathering; interpretation of 
administrative records and reports; correlation of information to corroborate facts; and 
coordination with management representatives.  The work requires the application of qualitative 
and quantitative analytical techniques that frequently require modification to fit a wider range of 
variables.  Subjects and projects assigned at this level usually consist of issues, problems, or 
concepts that are not always susceptible to direct observation and analysis (e.g., projected 
missions and functions).  Difficulty is encountered in measuring program effectiveness due to 
variations in the nature of administrative processes. Information about the subject is often 
conflicting or incomplete, cannot readily be obtained by direct means, or is otherwise difficult to 
document.  Assignments may involve compiling, reconciling, and correlating voluminous 
workload data from a variety of sources with different reporting requirements and formats, or the 
data must be carefully cross-checked, analyzed, and interpreted to obtain accurate and relevant 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
information.  Characteristic of the work is originality in refining existing work methods and 
techniques for application to the analysis of specific issues or resolution of problems.  The 
employee may revise methods for collecting data on workload, adopt new measures of 
productivity, or develop new approaches to relate productivity measurements to a performance 
reporting system.

Factor 5. Scope and Effect.   

            Level 5-4  225 points

Studies, analyzes, and develops ways to improve the accuracy, adequacy, timeliness, and validity 
of data and systems for disseminating information about the agency's programs and work force to 
managers in many echelons and/or geographic locations.  The purpose of the work is to assess 
the productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency of program operations or to analyze and resolve 
problems in the staffing, effectiveness and efficiency of administrative support and staff 
activities.  Work involves establishing criteria to measure and/or predict the attainment of 
program or organizational goals and objectives.  Work includes developing related 
administrative regulations, such as those governing the allocation and distribution of personnel, 
supplies, equipment, and other resources, or promulgating program guidance for application 
across organizational lines or in varied geographic locations.  Work involves performing very 
broad studies (e.g., involving several agencies) which are of significant interest to the public and 
the Government.  Analytical studies involve programs or policies that cut across a number of 
agencies and affect major segments of private industry (e.g., national and local emergency 
management programs, national emergency management policy), and collaborating with 
stakeholders and partners such as Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental 
organizations, and private sector.  Findings often lead to recommendations for the realignment of 
functional responsibilities between agencies or other equally significant changes in program 
direction or policy related to issues such as: occupant emergency planning, crisis management, 
continuity of operations and government, mission assurance, and resiliency activities.  Work 
provides a flexible structure that enables disaster recovery managers to operate in a unified and 
collaborative manner.  It also focuses on how best to restore, redevelop and revitalize the health, 
social, economic, natural and environmental fabric of the community.  Results of work are 
critical to the agency’s mission, and affect large numbers of people on a long term, continuing 
basis by providing integrated support to those impacted by disasters.  

Factors 6/7. Personal Contacts & Purpose of Contacts. 

Level 3C   180 points

Contacts include, but are not limited to, persons outside the agency. This may include 
consultants, contractors, business executives, engineers, scientists, occupational health and safety 
specialists, integration and inclusion specialists, legal advisors, land managers, security 
specialists, law enforcement officers, fire safety engineers, medical professionals, community 
leaders, public affairs specialists, and other non-governmental stakeholders.  Contacts both 
internal and external are representatives of different functional offices, support operations, 
activities, and programs which interrelate and impact on recovery planning.  Contacts include 
working closely with, and receiving support from, all levels of government  (Federal, State, 
local, tribal, territorial, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector) in recovering from 
emergency events and in developing interagency doctrine and procedures to be used during 
disaster response and recovery. Contacts are made in a moderately unstructured setting.  This 

 
 
 
  
 
 
level may also include contacts with program officials several managerial levels removed from 
the employee when such contacts occur on an ad-hoc basis.

The purpose of contacts is to influence managers or other officials to accept and implement 
findings and recommendations on organizational improvement or program effectiveness.  May 
encounter resistance due to such issues as organizational conflict, competing objectives, or 
resource problems. 

Factor 8. Physical Demands. 

    Level 8-1  5 points 

The work is primarily sedentary, although some slight physical effort may be required.  No 
physical demands are required to perform the work.

Factor 9. Work Environment.  

    Level 9-1  5 points 

The work is performed in a typical office setting.  Special safety precautions are not required.  
The position may require occasional travel.  

OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTS: 

The incumbent is required to complete a background investigation in order to obtain and 
maintain a security clearance or suitability determination. 

The actual or anticipated assignment of some types of emergency management duties may 
require the incumbent to have or obtain a valid security clearance above and beyond that 
required to perform the regular and recurring duties of this position. 

Frequent Temporary Duty (TDY) travel is required. 

If not otherwise identified in this position description, the incumbent may be required to perform 
emergency response duties in support of FEMA’s Emergency Management responsibilities such 
as: natural or man-made disasters; radiological emergency situations; actual or threatened 
nuclear attack; and national security training exercises and testing of readiness plans and 
procedures. 

The incumbent is assigned to an emergency team designed to perform essential functions during 
an actual or impending crisis or declared national emergency, and is subject to recall during non-
duty hours in the event of emergencies.  Incumbent is required by emergency assignment to be 
available to report to an emergency duty station during duty and non-duty hours by the fastest 
means available and be prepared to operate at the emergency duty station for an indefinite 
period. 

This position requires that the employee be prepared to work extended hours without relief in 
hazardous environments.  Emergency management personnel undergo considerable stress 
inherent in assignments that involve assistance following major disaster events.  The work is 
normally performed in an office setting.  However, this position requires that the incumbent 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
train, maintain a state of readiness, and be deployed into the possible high-risk environment of a 
disaster site.  Conditions in some disaster environments may include irregular diet or rations; 
limited rest; uncomfortable sleeping conditions; extensive overtime; an environment with 
unsanitary conditions; and related risks, such as reoccurrence of the disaster event (e.g., general 
hazards, or additional flooding).  Travel may be required on short notice, during poor conditions. 
Extreme caution must be exercised to assure personal safety, as well as safety of co-workers and 
members of the public who look to the employee for guidance. 

Emergency Assignment - Every FEMA employee has regular and recurring emergency 
management responsibilities, though not every position requires routine deployment to disaster 
sites.  All positions are subject to recall around the clock for emergency management operations, 
which may require irregular work hours, work at locations other than the official duty station, 
and may include duties other than those specified in the employee’s official position description.  
Travel requirements in support of emergency operations may be extensive in nature (weeks to 
months), with little advance notice, and may require employees to relocate to emergency sites 
with physically austere and operationally challenging conditions. 

Key Requirement – In addition to the travel and relocation that may be required by emergency 
assignments, this position may require occasional non-emergency travel.
