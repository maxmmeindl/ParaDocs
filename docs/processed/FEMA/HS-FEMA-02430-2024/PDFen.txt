(b)  Federal  personnel  management  should  be 
implemented  consistent  with  the  following 
merit system principles: 

(1) Recruitment should be from qualified in-
dividuals  from  appropriate  sources  in  an  en-
deavor  to  achieve  a  work  force  from  all  seg-
ments  of  society,  and  selection  and  advance-
ment should be determined solely on the basis 
of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after 
fair  and  open  competition  which  assures  that 
all receive equal opportunity. 

(2) All employees and applicants for employ-
ment  should  receive  fair  and  equitable  treat-
ment  in  all  aspects  of  personnel  management 
without  regard  to  political  affiliation,  race, 
color,  religion,  national  origin,  sex,  marital 
status,  age,  or  handicapping  condition,  and 
with  proper  regard  for  their  privacy  and  con-
stitutional rights. 

(3) Equal pay should be provided for work of 
equal value, with appropriate consideration of 
both  national  and  local  rates  paid  by  employ-

ers  in  the  private  sector,  and  appropriate  in-
centives  and  recognition  should  be  provided 
for excellence in performance. 

(4)  All  employees  should  maintain  high 
standards  of  integrity,  conduct,  and  concern 
for the public interest. 

(5) The Federal work force should be used ef-

ficiently and effectively. 

(6)  Employees  should  be  retained  on  the 
basis of the adequacy of their performance, in-
adequate performance should be corrected, and 
employees  should  be  separated  who  cannot  or 
will not improve their performance to meet re-
quired standards. 

(7)  Employees  should  be  provided  effective 
education and training in cases in which such 
education  and  training  would  result  in  better 
organizational and individual performance. 

(8) Employees should be— 

(A)  protected  against  arbitrary  action, 
personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan 
political purposes, and 

(B) prohibited from using their official au-
thority or influence for the purpose of inter-
fering with or affecting the result of an elec-
tion or a nomination for election. 

(9)  Employees  should  be  protected  against 
reprisal  for  the  lawful  disclosure  of  informa-
tion  which  the  employees  reasonably  believe 
evidences— 

(A) a violation of any law, rule, or regula-

tion, or 

(B)  mismanagement,  a  gross  waste  of 
funds,  an  abuse  of  authority,  or  a  substan-
tial  and  specific  danger  to  public  health  or 
safety. 

(c)  In  administering  the  provisions  of  this 

chapter— 

(1) with respect to any agency (as defined in 
section  2302(a)(2)(C)  of  this  title),  the  Presi-
dent  shall,  pursuant  to  the  authority  other-
wise  available  under  this  title,  take  any  ac-
tion,  including  the  issuance  of  rules,  regula-
tions, or directives; and

tive  branch  which  is  not  such  an  agency  or 
part of such an agency, the head of such entity 
shall,  pursuant  to  authority  otherwise  avail-
able,  take  any  action,  including  the  issuance 
of rules, regulations, or directives; 

which  is  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this 
title and which the President or the head, as the 
case  may  be,  determines  is  necessary  to  ensure 
that personnel management is based on and em-
bodies the merit system principles.

§ 2301 

NOTIFICATION AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEE 
ANTIDISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION 

Pub. L. 107–174, May 15, 2002, 116 Stat. 566, as amended 
by  Pub.  L.  109–435,  title  VI,  § 604(f),  Dec.  20,  2006,  120 
Stat. 3242, provided that: 
‘‘SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 

‘‘(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the ‘No-
tification  and  Federal  Employee  Antidiscrimination 
and Retaliation Act of 2002’. 

‘‘(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—[Omitted.] 

‘‘TITLE  I—GENERAL  PROVISIONS 

‘‘SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 

‘‘Congress finds that— 

‘‘(1)  Federal  agencies  cannot  be  run  effectively  if 

those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination; 

‘‘(2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, 
including representatives of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People and the Amer-
ican  Federation  of  Government  Employees,  that 
point  to  chronic  problems  of  discrimination  and  re-
taliation against Federal employees; 

‘‘(3)  in  August  2000,  a  jury  found  that  the  Environ-
mental Protection Agency had discriminated against 
a  senior  social  scientist,  and  awarded  that  scientist 
$600,000; 

‘‘(4)  in  October  2000,  an  Occupational  Safety  and 
Health  Administration  investigation  found  that  the 
Environmental  Protection  Agency  had  retaliated 
against  a  senior  scientist  for  disagreeing  with  that 
agency  on  a  matter  of  science  and  for  helping  Con-
gress to carry out its oversight responsibilities; 

‘‘(5)  there  have  been  several  recent  class  action 
suits  based  on  discrimination  brought  against  Fed-
eral agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation,  the  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco,  and  Fire-
arms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Im-
migration  and  Naturalization  Service,  the  United 
States  Marshals  Service,  the  Department  of  Agri-
culture,  the  United  States  Information  Agency,  and 
the Social Security Administration; 

‘‘(6)  notifying  Federal  employees  of  their  rights 
under  discrimination  and  whistleblower  laws  should 
increase Federal agency compliance with the law; 

‘‘(7)  requiring  annual  reports  to  Congress  on  the 
number  and  severity  of  discrimination  and  whistle-
blower  cases  brought  against  each  Federal  agency 
should enable Congress to improve its oversight over 
compliance by agencies with the law; and 

‘‘(8)  requiring  Federal  agencies  to  pay  for  any  dis-
crimination  or  whistleblower  judgment,  award,  or 
settlement  should  improve  agency  accountability 
with  respect  to  discrimination  and  whistleblower 
laws. 

‘‘SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 

‘‘It is the sense of Congress that— 

‘‘(1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court 
judgments  or  settlements  relating  to  discrimination 
and  whistleblower  laws  by  targeting  the  claimant  or 
other  employees  with  reductions  in  compensation, 
benefits,  or  workforce  to  pay  for  such  judgments  or 
settlements; 

‘‘(2) the mission of the Federal agency and the em-
ployment security of employees who are blameless in 
a whistleblower incident should not be compromised; 
‘‘(3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in 
force  or  furloughs  as  means  of  funding  a  reimburse-
ment under this Act; 

‘‘(4)(A)  accountability  in  the  enforcement  of  em-

ployee rights is not furthered by terminating— 
‘‘(i) the employment of other employees; or 
‘‘(ii)  the  benefits  to  which  those  employees  are 

entitled through statute or contract; and 
‘‘(B) this Act is not intended to authorize those ac-

tions; 

‘‘(5)(A)  nor  is  accountability  furthered  if  Federal 
agencies  react  to  the  increased  accountability  under 
this  Act  by  taking  unfounded  disciplinary  actions 

against  managers  or  by  violating  the  procedural 
rights  of  managers  who  have  been  accused  of  dis-
crimination; and 

‘‘(B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers 
have  adequate  training  in  the  management  of  a  di-
verse  workforce  and  in  dispute  resolution  and  other 
essential communication skills; and 

‘‘(6)(A)  Federal  agencies  are  expected  to  reimburse 
the General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable 
time under this Act; and 

‘‘(B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of 
reimbursement under this Act is large relative to an-
nual appropriations for that agency, may need to ex-
tend  reimbursement  over  several  years  in  order  to 
avoid— 

‘‘(i) reductions in force; 
‘‘(ii) furloughs; 
‘‘(iii)  other  reductions  in  compensation  or  bene-

fits for the workforce of the agency; or 

‘‘(iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agen-

cy. 

‘‘SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS. 

‘‘For purposes of this Act— 

‘‘(1)  the  term  ‘applicant  for  Federal  employment’ 
means  an  individual  applying  for  employment  in  or 
under a Federal agency; 

‘‘(2) the term ‘basis of alleged discrimination’ shall 
have the meaning given such term under section 303; 
‘‘(3)  the  term ‘Federal  agency’ means  an Executive 
agency  (as  defined  in  section  105  of  title  5,  United 
States Code), the United States Postal Service, or the

‘‘(4) the term ‘Federal employee’ means an individ-

ual employed in or under a Federal agency;

ginning more than 180 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act [May 15, 2002].

FEDERAL BENEFITS AND NON-DISCRIMINATION 

Memorandum of President of the United States, June 

17, 2009, 74 F.R. 29393, provided: 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Depart-

ments and Agencies 

Millions  of  hard-working,  dedicated,  and  patriotic 
public  servants  are  employed  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  as  part  of  the  civilian  workforce,  and  many  of 
these devoted Americans have same-sex domestic part-
ners.  Leading  companies  in  the  private  sector  are  free 
to provide to same-sex domestic partners the same ben-
efits they provide to married people of the opposite sex. 
Executive  departments  and  agencies,  however,  may 
only  provide  benefits  on  that  basis  if  they  have  legal 
authorization  to  do  so.  My  Administration  is  not  au-
thorized by Federal law to extend a number of available 
Federal  benefits  to  the  same-sex  partners  of  Federal 
employees. Within existing law, however, my Adminis-
tration,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  State, 
who  oversees  our  Foreign  Service  employees,  and  the 

§ 2302 

TITLE  5—GOVERNMENT  ORGANIZATION  AND  EMPLOYEES 

Page  178 

Director  of  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management,  who 
oversees  human  resource  management  for  our  civil 
service employees, has identified areas in which statu-
tory  authority  exists  to  achieve  greater  equality  for 
the  Federal  workforce  through  extension  to  same-sex 
domestic  partners  of  benefits  currently  available  to 
married people of the opposite sex. Extending available 
benefits  will  help  the  Federal  Government  compete 
with  the  private  sector  to  recruit  and  retain  the  best 
and the brightest employees. 

I hereby request the following: 
SECTION 1.  Extension  of  Identified  Benefits.  The  Sec-
retary of State and the Director of the Office of Person-
nel Management shall, in consultation with the Depart-
ment  of  Justice,  extend  the  benefits  they  have  respec-
tively  identified  to  qualified  same-sex  domestic  part-
ners  of  Federal  employees  where  doing  so  can  be 
achieved and is consistent with Federal law. 

SEC.  2.  Review  of  Governmentwide  Benefits.  The  heads 
of  all  other  executive  departments  and  agencies,  in 
consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, 
shall conduct a review of the benefits provided by their 
respective departments and agencies to determine what 
authority  they  have  to  extend  such  benefits  to  same- 
sex  domestic  partners  of  Federal  employees.  The  re-
sults of this review shall be reported within 90 days to 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management, 
who,  in  consultation  with  the  Department  of  Justice, 
shall  recommend  to  me  any  additional  measures  that 
can  be  taken,  consistent  with  existing  law,  to  provide 
benefits  to  the  same-sex  domestic  partners  of  Federal 
Government employees. 

SEC. 3. Promoting Compliance with Existing Law Requir-
ing Federal Workplaces to be Free of Discrimination Based 
on  Non-Merit  Factors.  The  Office  of  Personnel  Manage-
ment  shall  issue  guidance  within  90  days  to  all  execu-
tive  departments  and  agencies  regarding  compliance 
with,  and  implementation  of,  the  civil  service  laws, 
rules,  and  regulations,  including  5  U.S.C.  2302(b)(10), 
which  make  it  unlawful  to  discriminate  against  Fed-
eral  employees  or  applicants  for  Federal  employment 
on  the  basis  of  factors  not  related  to  job  performance. 
SEC.  4.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memo-
randum  shall  be  construed  to  impair  or  otherwise  af-
fect: 

(i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to 

an agency, or the head thereof; or 

(ii) Functions of  the  Director of  the Office  of Man-
agement  and  Budget  relating  to  budgetary,  adminis-
trative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consist-
ent with applicable law  and  subject to the availability 
of appropriations. 

(c)  This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does 
not,  create  any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or  proce-
dural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any  party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person. 

SEC. 5. Publication.  The Director  of the  Office  of  Per-
sonnel  Management  is  hereby  authorized  and  directed 
to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

EXTENSION OF BENEFITS TO SAME-SEX DOMESTIC 
PARTNERS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 

Memorandum of President of the United States, June 

2, 2010, 75 F.R. 32247, provided: 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Depart-

ments and Agencies 

For  far  too  long,  many  of  our  Government’s  hard- 
working,  dedicated  LGBT  employees  have  been  denied 
equal  access  to  the  basic  rights  and  benefits  their  col-
leagues  enjoy.  This  kind  of  systemic  inequality  under-
mines  the  health,  well-being,  and  security  not  just  of 
our  Federal  workforce,  but  also  of  their  families  and 
communities.  That  is  why,  last  June,  I  directed  the 
heads  of  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agen-
cies), in consultation with the Office of Personnel Man-

agement  (OPM),  to  conduct  a  thorough  review  of  the 
benefits they provide and to identify any that could be 
extended  to  LGBT  employees  and  their  partners  and 
families.  Although  legislative  action  is  necessary  to 
provide  full  equality  to  LGBT  Federal  employees,  the 
agencies  have  identified  a  number  of  benefits  that  can 
be  extended  under  existing  law.  OPM,  in  consultation 
with  the  Department  of  Justice,  has  provided  me  with 
a  report  recommending  that  all  of  the  identified  bene-
fits be extended. 

Accordingly, I hereby direct the following: 
SECTION 1. Immediate Actions To Extend Benefits. Agen-
cies  should  immediately  take  the  following  actions, 
consistent  with  existing  law,  in  order  to  extend  bene-
fits  to  the  same-sex  domestic  partners  of  Federal  em-
ployees, and, where applicable, to the children of same- 
sex domestic partners of Federal employees: 

(a)  The  Director  of  OPM  should  take  appropriate  ac-

tion to: 

(i)  clarify  that  the  children  of  employees’  same-sex 
domestic  partners  fall  within  the  definition  of  ‘‘child’’ 
for purposes of Federal child-care subsidies, and, where 
appropriate, for child-care services; 

(ii)  clarify  that,  for  purposes  of  employee  assistance 
programs,  same-sex  domestic  partners  and  their  chil-
dren qualify as ‘‘family members’’; 

(iii) issue a proposed rule that would clarify that em-
ployees’ same-sex domestic partners qualify as ‘‘family 
members’’  for  purposes  of  noncompetitive  appoint-
ments  made  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  12721  of  July 
30, 1990; 

(iv) issue a proposed rule that would add a Federal re-
tiree’s same-sex domestic partner to the list of individ-
uals presumed to have an insurable interest in the em-
ployee pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8339(k)(1), 8420; 

(v) clarify that under appropriate circumstances, em-
ployees’ same-sex domestic partners and their children 
qualify  as  dependents  for  purposes  of  evacuation  pay-
ments made under 5 U.S.C. 5522–5523; Folio: 1632 [sic] 

(vi)  amend  its  guidance  on  implementing  President 
Clinton’s April 11, 1997, memorandum to heads of execu-
tive  departments  and  agencies  on  ‘‘Expanded  Family 
and  Medical  Leave  Policies’’  to  specify  that  the  24 
hours  of  unpaid  leave  made  available  to  Federal  em-
ployees  in  connection  with  (i)  school  and  early  child-
hood educational activities; (ii) routine family medical 
purposes;  and  (iii)  elderly  relatives’  health  or  care 
needs, may be used to meet the needs of an employee’s 
same-sex  domestic  partner  or  the  same-sex  domestic 
partner’s children; and 

(vii)  clarify that  employees’  same-sex domestic part-
ners  qualify  as  dependents  for  purposes  of  calculating 
the extra allowance payable under 5 U.S.C. 5942a to as-
sist employees stationed on Johnston Island, subject to 
any limitations applicable to spouses. 

(b)  The  Administrator  of  General  Services  should 
take  appropriate  action  to  amend  the  definitions  of 
‘‘immediate family’’ and ‘‘dependent’’ appearing in the 
Federal  Travel  Regulations,  41  C.F.R.  Chs.  300–304,  to 
include same-sex domestic partners and their children, 
so that employees and their domestic partners and chil-
dren can obtain the full benefits available under appli-
cable law, including certain travel, relocation, and sub-
sistence payments. 

(c)  All  agencies  offering  any  of  the  benefits  specified 
by  OPM  in  implementing  guidance  under  section  3  of 
this memorandum, including credit union membership, 
access  to  fitness  facilities,  and  access  to  planning  and 
counseling  services,  should  take  all  appropriate  action 
to provide the same level of benefits that is provided to 
employees’  spouses  and  their  children  to  employees’ 
same-sex domestic partners and their children. 

(d) All agencies with authority to provide benefits to 
employees  outside  of  the  context  of  title  5,  United 
States  Code  should  take  all  appropriate  actions  to  en-
sure  that  the  benefits  being  provided  to  employees’ 
spouses  and  their  children  are  also  being  provided,  at 
an equivalent level wherever permitted by law, to their 
employees’  same-sex  domestic  partners  and  their  chil-
dren.

§ 2304 

SEC.  2.  Continuing  Obligation  To  Provide  New  Benefits. 
In the future, all agencies that provide new benefits to 
the  spouses  of  Federal  employees  and  their  children 
should,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  also  provide 
them  to  the  same-sex  domestic  partners  of  their  em-
ployees  and  those  same-sex  domestic  partners’  chil-
dren.  This  section  applies  to  appropriated  and  nonap-
propriated fund instrumentalities of such agencies. 

SEC. 3. Monitoring and Guidance. The Director of OPM 
shall  monitor  compliance  with  this  memorandum,  and 
may instruct agencies to provide the Director with re-
ports  on  the  status  of  their  compliance,  and  prescribe 
the  form  Folio:  1633  [sic]  and  manner  of  such  reports. 
The  Director  of  OPM  shall  also  issue  guidance  to  en-

moval  of  an  individual  from  employment  as  a 
law  enforcement  officer  before  a  conviction  no-
tice  date  if  the  removal  is  properly  effected

You  are  hereby  authorized  and  directed  to  report

law  judge  appointed  under  section  3105  of  this 
title  or  other  employee  of  the  Board  designated 
by  the  Board  to  hear  such  cases,  except  that  in 
any  case  involving  a  removal  from  the  service, 
the  case  shall  be  heard  by  the  Board,  an  em-
ployee experienced in hearing appeals, or an ad-
ministrative  law  judge.  The  Board,  administra-
tive  law  judge,  or  other  employee  (as  the  case 
may  be)  shall  make  a  decision  after  receipt  of 
the written representations of the parties to the 
appeal and after opportunity for a hearing under

vides that such employee or applicant shall re-
turn or be present at the place of employment 
during the period pending the outcome of any 
petition for review under subsection (e); and 

(II)  the  employing  agency,  subject  to  the 
provisions  of  subparagraph  (B),  determines 
that  the  return  or  presence  of  such  employee 
or  applicant  is  unduly  disruptive  to  the  work 
environment. 

(B) If an agency makes a determination under 
subparagraph (A)(ii)(II) that prevents the return 
or  presence  of  an  employee  at  the  place  of  em-
ployment,  such  employee  shall  receive  pay, 
compensation,  and  all  other  benefits  as  terms 
and conditions of employment during the period 
pending  the  outcome  of  any  petition  for  review 
under subsection (e).

may  be  construed  to  require  any  award  of  back 
pay  or  attorney  fees  be  paid  before  the  decision 
is final. 

(3)  With  respect  to  an  appeal  from  an  adverse 
action  covered  by  subchapter  V  of  chapter  75,

in 5 U.S.C. 7503(b). 

(b)  Notice  of  proposed  action.  The  no-
tice  must  state  the  specific  reason(s) 
for the proposed action, and inform the 
employee  of  his  or  her  right  to  review 
the  material  which  is  relied  on  to  sup-
port the reasons for action given in the 
notice. 

(c)  Employee’s  answer.  The  employee 
must  be  given  a  reasonable  time,  but 
not less than 24 hours, to answer orally

support of the answer. 

(d)  Representation.  An  employee  cov-
ered  by  this  subpart  is  entitled  to  be 

represented  by  an  attorney  or  other 
representative.  An  agency  may  dis-
allow  as  an  employee’s  representative 
an  individual  whose  activities  as  rep-
resentative  would  cause  a  conflict  of 
interest  or  position,  or  an  employee  of 
the  agency  whose  release  from  his  or 
her  official  position  would  give  rise  to 
unreasonable  costs  or  whose  priority 
work  assignments  preclude  his  or  her 
release. 

(e)  Agency  decision.  (1)  In  arriving  at 
its  decision,  the  agency  will  consider 
only the reasons specified in the notice 
of  proposed  action  and  any  answer  of 
the  employee  or  his  or  her  representa-
tive, or both, made to a designated offi-
cial. 

(2)  The  agency  must  specify  in  writ-
ing  the  reason(s)  for  the  decision  and 
advise  the  employee  of  any  grievance 
rights  under  paragraph  (f)  of  this  sec-
tion.  The  agency  must  deliver  the  no-
tice  of  decision  to  the  employee  on  or 
before  the  effective  date  of  the  action. 
(f) Grievances. The employee may file 
a  grievance  through  an  agency  admin-
istrative  grievance  system  (if  applica-
ble)  or,  if  the  suspension  falls  within 
the  coverage  of  an  applicable  nego-
tiated  grievance  procedure,  an  em-
ployee  in  an  exclusive  bargaining  unit 
may  file  a  grievance  only  under  that 
procedure.  Sections 
7114(a)(5)  and 
7121(b)(1)(C)  of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  and 
the  terms  of  any  collective  bargaining 
agreement,  govern  representation  for 
employees  in  an  exclusive  bargaining 
unit who grieve a suspension under this 
subpart  through  the  negotiated  griev-
ance procedure. 

(g)  Agency  records.  The  agency  must 
maintain  copies  of,  and  will  furnish  to 
the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board 
and  to  the  employee  upon  their  re-
quest, the following documents: 

(1) Notice of the proposed action; 
(2) Employee’s written reply, if any; 
(3)  Summary  of  the  employee’s  oral 

reply, if any;

sion, together with any supporting ma-
terial.

§ 752.403 

5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–12 Edition) 

Pay means the rate of basic pay fixed 
by law or administrative action for the 
position  held  by  the  employee,  that  is, 
the  rate  of  pay  before  any  deductions 
and  exclusive  of  additional  pay  of  any 
kind. 

Similar  positions  means  positions  in 
which the duties performed are similar 
in  nature  and  character  and  require 
substantially  the  same  or  similar 
qualifications,  so  that  the  incumbent 
could  be  interchanged  between  the  po-
sitions  without  significant  training  or 
undue interruption to the work. 

Suspension  means  the  placing  of  an 
employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a 
temporary  status  without  duties  and 
pay for more than 14 days. 

§ 752.403 Standard for action. 

(a)  An  agency  may  take  an  adverse 
action,  including  a  performance-based 
adverse  action  or  an  indefinite  suspen-
sion,  under  this  subpart  only  for  such 
cause  as  will  promote  the  efficiency  of 
the service. 

(b)  An  agency  may  not  take  an  ad-
verse  action  against  an  employee  on 
the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 
U.S.C. 2302. 

§ 752.404 Procedures. 

(a)  Statutory  entitlements.  An  em-
ployee against whom action is proposed 
under  this  subpart  is  entitled  to  the 
procedures  provided  in  5  U.S.C.  7513(b). 
(b)  Notice  of  proposed  action.  (1)  An 
employee  against  whom  an  action  is 
proposed is entitled to at least 30 days’ 
advance  written  notice  unless  there  is 
an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of  this  section.  The  notice  must  state 
the  specific  reason(s)  for  the  proposed 
action, and inform the employee of his 
or  her  right  to  review  the  material 
which  is  relied  on  to  support  the  rea-
sons for action given in the notice. 

(2)  When  some  but  not  all  employees 
in  a  given  competitive  level  are  being 
furloughed,  the  notice  of  proposed  ac-
tion  must  state  the  basis  for  selecting 
a  particular  employee  for  furlough,  as 
well as the reasons for the furlough. 

(3) Under ordinary circumstances,  an 
employee whose removal or suspension, 
including  indefinite  suspension,  has 
been  proposed  will  remain  in  a  duty 
status  in  his  or  her  regular  position 
during  the  advance  notice  period.  In 

those  rare  circumstances  where  the 
agency determines that the employee’s 
continued  presence  in  the  workplace 
during  the  notice  period  may  pose  a 
threat  to  the  employee  or  others,  re-
sult  in  loss  of  or  damage  to  Govern-
ment property, or otherwise jeopardize 
legitimate  Government  interests,  the 
agency may elect one or a combination 
of the following alternatives: 

(i)  Assigning  the  employee  to  duties 
where he or she is no longer a threat to 
safety,  the  agency  mission,  or  to  Gov-
ernment property; 

(ii)  Allowing  the  employee  to  take 
leave, or carrying him or her in an ap-
propriate  leave  status  (annual,  sick, 
leave  without  pay,  or  absence  without 
leave)  if  the  employee  has  absented 
himself  or  herself  from  the  worksite 
without requesting leave; 

(iii)  Curtailing  the  notice  period 
when the agency can invoke the provi-
sions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; 
or 

(iv)  Placing  the  employee  in  a  paid, 
nonduty status for such time as is nec-
essary to effect the action. 

(c)  Employee’s  answer.  (1)  An  em-
ployee  may  answer  orally  and  in  writ-
ing  except  as  provided  in  paragraph 
(c)(2)  of  this  section.  The  agency  must 
give the employee a reasonable amount 
of  official  time  to  review  the  material 
relied  on  to  support  its  proposed  ac-
tion,  to  prepare  an  answer  orally  and 
in  writing,  and  to  secure  affidavits,  if 
the  employee  is  in  an  active  duty  sta-
tus.  The  agency  may  require  the  em-
ployee  to  furnish  any  answer  to  the 
proposed  action,  and  affidavits  and 
other documentary evidence in support 
of  the  answer,  within  such  time  as 
would  be  reasonable,  but  not  less  than 
7 days. 

(2) The agency will designate an offi-
cial to hear the employee’s oral answer 
who  has  authority  either  to  make  or 
recommend a final decision on the pro-
posed  adverse  action.  The  right  to  an-
swer  orally  in  person  does  not  include 
the  right  to  a  formal  hearing  with  ex-
amination  of  witnesses  unless  the 
agency provides for such hearing in its 
regulations.  Under  5  U.S.C.  7513(c),  the 
agency may, in its regulations, provide 
a  hearing  in  place  of  or  in  addition  to 
the  opportunity  for  written  and  oral 
answer.

§ 752.406 

(3) If the employee wishes the agency 
to  consider  any  medical  condition 
which  may  contribute  to  a  conduct, 
performance, or leave problem, the em-
ployee must be given a reasonable time 
to  furnish  medical  documentation  (as 
defined  in  § 339.104  of  this  chapter)  of 
the  condition.  Whenever  possible,  the 
employee  will  supply  such  documenta-
tion within the time limits allowed for 
an answer. 

(d)  Exceptions.  (1)  Section  7513(b)  of 
title  5,  U.S.  Code,  authorizes  an  excep-
tion to the 30 days’ advance written no-
tice  when  the  agency  has  reasonable 
cause to believe that the employee has 
committed  a  crime  for  which  a  sen-
tence of imprisonment may be imposed 
and  is  proposing  a  removal  or  suspen-
sion,  including  indefinite  suspension. 
This  notice  exception  is  commonly  re-
ferred  to  as  the  ‘‘crime  provision.’’ 
This provision may be invoked even in 
the absence of judicial action. 

(2)  The  advance  written  notice  and 
opportunity to answer are not required 
for furlough without pay due to unfore-
seeable  circumstances,  such  as  sudden 
breakdowns  in  equipment,  acts  of  God, 
or sudden emergencies requiring imme-
diate curtailment of activities. 

(e)  Representation.  Section  7513(b)(3) 
of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  provides  that  an 
employee  covered  by  this  part  is  enti-
tled  to  be  represented  by  an  attorney 
or  other  representative.  An  agency 
may  disallow  as  an  employee’s  rep-
resentative an individual whose activi-
ties  as  representative  would  cause  a 
conflict  of  interest  or  position,  or  an 
employee  of  the  agency  whose  release 
from  his  or  her  official  position  would 
give  rise  to  unreasonable  costs  or 
whose  priority  work  assignments  pre-
clude his or her release. 

(f)  Agency  review  of  medical  informa-
tion.  When  medical  information  is  sup-
plied  by  the  employee  pursuant  to 
paragraph  (c)(3)  of  this  section,  the 
agency  may,  if  authorized,  require  a 
medical examination under the criteria 
of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, 
at  its  option,  offer  a  medical  examina-
tion  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of 
§ 339.302 of this chapter. If the employee 
has the requisite years of service under 
the  Civil  Service  Retirement  System 
or  the  Federal  Employees’  Retirement 
System, the agency must provide infor-

mation  concerning  disability  retire-
ment. The agency must be aware of the 
affirmative  obligations  of  the  provi-
sions  of  29  CFR  1614.203,  which  require 
reasonable  accommodation  of  a  quali-
fied individual with a disability. 

(g)  Agency  decision.  (1)  In  arriving  at 
its  decision,  the  agency  will  consider 
only the reasons specified in the notice 
of  proposed  action  and  any  answer  of 
the  employee  or  his  or  her  representa-
tive, or both, made to a designated offi-
cial  and  any  medical  documentation 
reviewed  under  paragraph  (f)  of  this 
section. 

(2) The notice must specify in writing 
the reasons for the decision and advise 
the  employee  of  any  appeal  or  griev-
ance  rights  under  § 752.405  of  this  part. 
The  agency  must  deliver  the  notice  of 
decision  to  the  employee  on  or  before 
the effective date of the action. 

(h)  Applications  for  disability  retire-
ment. Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter 
provides  that  an  employee’s  applica-
tion  for  disability  retirement  need  not 
delay  any  other  appropriate  personnel 
action.  Section  831.1205  and  § 844.202  of 
this  chapter  set  forth  the  basis  under 
which  an  agency  must  file  an  applica-
tion for disability retirement on behalf 
of an employee. 

§ 752.405 Appeal and grievance rights. 
(a)  Appeal  rights.  Under  the  provi-
sions  of  5  U.S.C.  7513(d),  an  employee 
against whom an action is taken under 
this subpart is entitled to appeal to the 
Merit Systems Protection Board. 

(b)  Grievance  rights.  As  provided  at  5 
U.S.C. 7121(e)(1), if a matter covered by 
this  subpart  falls  within  the  coverage 
of  an  applicable  negotiated  grievance 
procedure,  an  employee  may  elect  to 
file  a  grievance  under  that  procedure 
or appeal to the Merit Systems Protec-
tion Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701, but not 
both. 
and 
7121(b)(1)(C)  of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  and 
the  terms  of  an  applicable  collective 
bargaining  agreement,  govern  rep-
resentation  for  employees  in  an  exclu-
sive bargaining unit who grieve a mat-
ter  under  this  subpart  through  the  ne-
gotiated grievance procedure.

where he or she is no longer a threat to 
safety,  the  agency  mission,  or  Govern-
ment property; 

(ii)  Allowing  the  appointee  to  take 
leave, or carrying him or her in an ap-
propriate  leave  status  (annual,  sick, 
leave  without  pay,  or  absence  without 
leave)  if  the  appointee  has  absented 
himself  or  herself  from  the  worksite 
without requesting leave; 

(iii)  Curtailing  the  notice  period 
when the agency can invoke the provi-
sions  of  paragraph  (d)  of  this  section; 
or 

(iv)  Placing  the  appointee  in  a  paid, 
nonduty status for such time as is nec-
essary to effect the action. 

the  appointee  a 

(c)  Appointee’s  answer.  (1)  The  ap-
pointee may answer orally and in writ-
ing  except  as  provided  in  paragraph 
(c)(2)  of  this  section.  The  agency  must 
reasonable 
give 
amount  of  official  time  to  review  the 
material  relied  on  to  support  its  pro-
posed  action,  to  prepare  an  answer 
orally and in writing, and to secure af-
fidavits, if the appointee is in an active 
duty  status.  The  agency  may  require 
the appointee to furnish any answer to 
the proposed action, and affidavits and 
other documentary evidence in support 
of  the  answer,  within  such  time  as 
would  be  reasonable,  but  not  less  than 
7 days. 

(2) The agency will designate an offi-
cial to hear the appointee’s oral answer 
who has authority either to make or to 
recommend a final decision on the pro-
posed  adverse  action.  The  right  to  an-
swer  orally  in  person  does  not  include 
the  right  to  a  formal  hearing  with  ex-
amination  of  witnesses  unless  the 
agency provides for such hearing in its 
regulations.  Under  5  U.S.C.  7543(c),  the 
agency may in its regulations provide a 
hearing in place of or in addition to the 
opportunity  for  written  and  oral  an-
swer. 

(3) If the appointee wishes the agency 
to consider any medical condition that

given  reasonable  time  to  furnish  med-
ical  documentation 
in 
§ 339.104  of  this  chapter)  of  the  condi-
tion.  Whenever  possible,  the  appointee 
will supply such documentation within 
the  time  limits  allowed  for  an  answer. 

(as  defined 

(d)  Exception.  Section  7543(b)(1)  of 
title  5,  U.S.  Code,  authorizes  an  excep-
tion to the 30 days’ advance written no-
tice  when  the  agency  has  reasonable 
cause to believe that the appointee has 
committed  a  crime  for  which  a  sen-
tence of imprisonment may be imposed 
and  is  proposing  a  removal  or  suspen-
sion.  This  notice  exception  is  com-
monly  referred  to  as  the  ‘‘crime  provi-
sion.’’  This  provision  may  be  invoked 
even in the absence of judicial action. 

(e)  Representation.  Section  7543(b)(3) 
of  title  5,  U.S.  Code,  provides  that  an 
appointee  covered  by  this  part  is  enti-
tled  to  be  represented  by  an  attorney 
or  other  representative.  An  agency 
may  disallow  as  an  appointee’s  rep-
resentative an individual whose activi-
ties  as  representative  would  cause  a 
conflict  of  interest  or  position,  or  an 
employee  of  the  agency  whose  release 
from  his  or  her  official  position  would 
give  rise  to  unreasonable  costs  or 
whose  priority  work  assignments  pre-
clude his or her release. 

(f)  Agency  review  of  medical  informa-
tion.  When  medical  information  is  sup-
plied  by  the  appointee  pursuant  to 
paragraph  (c)(3)  of  this  section,  the 
agency  may,  if  authorized,  require  a 
medical examination under the criteria 
of § 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, 
at  its  option,  offer  a  medical  examina-
tion  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of 
§ 339.302  of  this  chapter.  If  the  ap-
pointee has the requisite years of serv-
ice  under  the  Civil  Service  Retirement 
System  or  the  Federal  Employees’  Re-
tirement System, the agency must pro-
vide  information  concerning  disability 
retirement.  The  agency  must  be  aware 
of  the  affirmative  obligations  of  the 
provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which re-
quire  reasonable  accommodation  of  a 
qualified individual with a disability. 

(g)  Agency  decision.  (1)  In  arriving  at 
its  decision,  the  agency  will  consider 
only the reasons specified in the notice 
of  proposed  action  and  any  answer  of 
the  appointee  or  the  appointee’s  rep-
resentative,  or  both,  made  to  a  des-
ignated  official  and  any  medical  docu-
mentation  reviewed  under  paragraph 
(f) of this section. 

(2) The notice must specify in writing 
the reasons for the decision and advise 
the  appointee  of  any  appeal  rights 
under  § 752.605  of  this  part.  The  agency

must  deliver  the  notice  of  decision  to 
the appointee on or before the effective 
date of the action. 

(h)  Applications  for  disability  retire-
ment. Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter 
provides  that  an  appointee’s  applica-
tion  for  disability  retirement  need  not 
delay  any  other  appropriate  personnel 
action.  Section  831.1205  and  § 844.202  of 
this  chapter  set  forth  the  basis  under 
which  an  agency  must  file  an  applica-
tion for disability retirement on behalf 
of an appointee. 

§ 752.605 Appeal rights. 

(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 7543(d), a career ap-
pointee  against  whom  an  action  is 
taken  under  this  subpart  is  entitled  to 
appeal  to  the  Merit  Systems  Protec-
tion Board. 

(b)  A  limited  term  or  limited  emer-
gency  appointee  who  is  covered  under 
§ 752.601(c)(2) also may appeal an action 
taken  under  this  subpart  to  the  Merit 
Systems Protection Board. 

§ 752.606 Agency records. 

The agency must maintain copies  of, 
and  will  furnish  to  the  Merit  Systems 
Protection  Board  and  to  the  appointee 
upon  his  or  her  request,  the  following 
documents: 

(a) Notice of the proposed action; 
(b)  Appointee’s  written  reply,  if  any; 
(c)  Summary  of  the  appointee’s  oral 

reply, if any;

tive  covered  by  the  provisionally  cer-
tified  system  at  a  rate  that  does  not 
exceed the rate for level II of the Exec-
utive  Schedule  (consistent  with  5  CFR 
part 534, subpart D, when effective) and 
pay senior employees covered by provi-

President’s  salary  under  3  U.S.C.  104

part B). 

(3)  An  agency  must  resubmit  an  ap-
plication requesting provisional certifi-
cation  for  every  calendar  year  for 
which  it  intends  to  maintain  provi-
sional  certification.  An  agency  with  a 
provisionally  certified  appraisal  sys-
tem(s)  may  request  that  OPM,  with 
OMB  concurrence,  grant  full  certifi-
cation  upon  a  showing  that  its  per-
formance  appraisal  systems  for  senior 
executives  and  senior  professionals,  as 
applicable,  meet  the  certification  cri-
teria in § 430.404 and the documentation 
requirements  in  this  section,  particu-

requirement. 
Agencies  with  certified  appraisal  sys-
tems must provide OPM with a general 
summary  of  the  annual  summary  rat-
ings  and  ratings  of  record,  as  applica-
ble, and rates of basic pay, pay adjust-
ments,  cash  awards,  and  aggregate 
total  compensation 
(including  any 
lump-sum  payments  in  excess  of  the 
applicable  aggregate  limitation  on  pay 
that  were  paid  in  the  current  calendar 
year  as  required  by  § 530.204)  for  their 
senior employees covered by a certified 
appraisal  system  at  the  conclusion  of 
each  appraisal  period  that  ends  during 
a  calendar  year  for  which  the  certifi-
cation  is  in  effect,  in  accordance  with 
OPM instructions. 

(h)  Suspension  of  certification.  (1) 
When  OPM  determines  that  an  agen-
cy’s  certified  appraisal  system  is  no 
longer in compliance with certification 
criteria,  OPM,  with  OMB  concurrence, 
may suspend such certification, as pro-
vided  in  paragraph  (c)(3)  of  this  sec-
tion. 

(2)  An  agency’s  system  certification 
is  automatically  suspended  when  OPM 

withdraws  performance  appraisal  sys-
tem  approval  or  mandates  corrective 
action because of misapplication of the 
system as authorized under §§ 430.210(c), 
430.312(c), and 430.403(e). 

(3)  OPM  will  notify  the  head  of  the 
agency at least 30 calendar days in ad-
vance  of  the  suspension  and  the  rea-
son(s)  for  the  suspension,  as  well  as 
any  expected  corrective  action.  Upon 
such  notice,  and  until  its  system  cer-
tification  is  reinstated,  the  agency 
must  set  a  senior  executive’s  rate  of 
basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart 
D,  when  effective,  at  a  rate  that  does 
not  exceed  the  rate  for  level  III  of  the 
Executive  Schedule.  While  certifi-
cation  is  suspended,  an  agency  must 
limit  aggregate  compensation  received 
in a calendar year by a senior employee 
to  the  rate  for  level  I  of  the  Executive 
cash 
Schedule.  Pay  adjustments, 
awards, and levels of pay in effect prior 
to that notice will remain in effect un-
less  OPM  finds  that  any  such  decision 
and subsequent action was in violation 
of law, rule, or regulation. 

(4) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may 
reinstate an agency’s suspended certifi-
cation only after the agency has taken 
appropriate corrective action. 

(5)  OPM  may  reinstate  the  certifi-
cation  of  an  appraisal  system  that  has 
been  automatically  suspended  under 
paragraph  (h)(2)  of  this  section  upon 
the  agency’s  compliance  with  the  ap-
plicable  OPM-mandated  corrective  ac-
tion(s).

§ 432.104 Addressing unacceptable per-

formance. 

At  any  time  during  the  performance 
appraisal cycle that an employee’s per-
formance is determined to be unaccept-
able  in  one  or  more  critical  elements, 
the agency shall notify the employee of 
the  critical  element(s)  for  which  per-
formance  is  unacceptable  and  inform 
the  employee  of  the  performance  re-
quirement(s)  or  standard(s)  that  must 
be attained in order to demonstrate ac-
ceptable  performance  in  his  or  her  po-
sition.  The  agency  should  also  inform 
the  employee  that  unless  his  or  her 
performance  in  the  critical  element(s) 
improves  to  and  is  sustained  at  an  ac-
ceptable level, the employee may be re-
duced  in  grade  or  removed.  For  each 
critical  element  in  which  the  employ-
ee’s  performance  is  unacceptable,  the 
agency shall afford the employee a rea-
sonable opportunity to demonstrate ac-
ceptable  performance,  commensurate 
with  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of 
the employee’s position. As part of the 
employee’s opportunity to demonstrate 
acceptable  performance,  the  agency 
shall  offer  assistance  to  the  employee 
in  improving  unacceptable  perform-
ance. 

[55  FR  25950,  June  26,  1990,  as  amended  at  58 
FR 65534, Dec. 15, 1993] 

§ 432.105 Proposing  and  taking  action 
based  on  unacceptable  perform-
ance. 

(a) Proposing action based on unaccept-
able  performance.  (1)  Once  an  employee 
has  been  afforded  a  reasonable  oppor-
tunity  to  demonstrate  acceptable  per-
formance pursuant to § 432.104, an agen-
cy may propose a reduction-in-grade or 
removal  action  if  the  employee’s  per-
formance  during  or  following  the  op-
portunity  to  demonstrate  acceptable 
performance  is  unacceptable  in  1  or 
more of the critical elements for which 
the  employee  was  afforded  an  oppor-

tunity  to  demonstrate  acceptable  per-
formance. 

(2)  If  an  employee  has  performed  ac-
ceptably  for  1  year  from  the  beginning 
of  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  ac-
ceptable  performance  (in  the  critical 
element(s) for which the employee was 
afforded  an  opportunity 
to  dem-
onstrate  acceptable  performance),  and 
the  employee’s  performance  again  be-
comes  unacceptable,  the  agency  shall 
afford  the  employee  an  additional  op-
portunity  to  demonstrate  acceptable 
performance before determining wheth-
er  to  propose  a  reduction  in  grade  or 
removal under this part. 

(3)  A  proposed  action  may  be  based 
on  instances  of  unacceptable  perform-
ance which occur within a 1 year period 
ending on the date of the notice of pro-
posed action. 

(4)  An  employee  whose  reduction  in 
grade or removal is proposed under this 
part is entitled to: 

(i)  Advance  notice.  (A)  The  agency 
shall  afford  the  employee  a  30  day  ad-
vance  notice  of  the  proposed  action 
that  identifies  both  the  specific  in-
stances  of  unacceptable  performance 
by the employee on which the proposed 
action  is  based  and  the  critical  ele-
ment(s)  of  the  employee’s  position  in-
volved in each instance of unacceptable 
performance. 

(B)  An  agency  may  extend  this  ad-
vance  notice  period  for  a  period  not  to 
exceed  30  days  under  regulations  pre-
scribed  by  the  head  of  the  agency.  An 
agency  may  extend  this  notice  period 
further without prior OPM approval for 
the following reasons: 

(1) To obtain and/or evaluate medical 
information  when  the  employee  has 
raised a medical issue in the answer to 
a  proposed  reduction  in  grade  or  re-
moval; 

(2)  To  arrange  for  the  employee’s 
travel  to  make  an  oral  reply  to  an  ap-
propriate  agency  official,  or  the  travel 
of  an  agency  official  to  hear  the  em-
ployee’s oral reply; 

(3) To consider the employee’s answer 
if an extention to the period for an an-
swer  has  been  granted  (e.g.,  because  of 
the  employee’s  illness  or  incapacita-
tion); 

(4)  To  consider  reasonable  accommo-

dation of a handicapping condition;

§ 432.106 

(5) If agency procedures so require, to 
consider  positions  to  which  the  em-
ployee  might  be  reassigned  or  reduced 
in grade; or 

(6) To comply with a stay ordered by 
a member of the Merit Systems Protec-
tion Board under 5 U.S.C. 1208(b). 

(C)  If  an  agency  believes  that  an  ex-
tension of the advance notice period is 
necessary  for  another  reason,  it  may 
request  prior  approval  for  such  exten-
sion  from  the  Chief,  Family  Programs 
and  Employee  Relations  Division,  Of-
fice  of  Labor  Relations  and  Workforce 
Performance,  Personnel  Systems  and 
Oversight  Group,  Office  of  Personnel 
Management, 1900 E Street NW., Wash-
ington, DC 20415. 

(ii) Opportunity to answer. The agency 
shall  afford  the  employee  a  reasonable 
time  to  answer  the  agency’s  notice  of 
proposed action orally and in writing. 

(iii)  Representation.  The  agency  shall 
allow  the  employee  to  be  represented 
by an attorney or other representative. 
An agency may disallow as an employ-
ee’s representative an individual whose 
activities  as  a  representative  would 
cause  a  conflict  of  interest  or  position 
or  an  employee  whose  release  from  his 
or  her  official  position  would  give  rise 
to  unreasonable  costs  to  the  Govern-
ment  or  whose  priority  work  assign-
ment  precludes  his  or  her  release  from 
official duties. 

(iv)  Consideration  of  medical  condi-
tions.  The  agency  shall  allow  an  em-
ployee  who  wishes  to  raise  a  medical 
condition  which  may  have  contributed 
to his or her unacceptable performance 
to  furnish  medical  documentation  (as 
defined in § 339.102 of this chapter of the 
condition  for  the  agency’s  consider-
ation. Whenever possible, the employee 
shall  supply  this  documentation  fol-
lowing  the agency’s notification of un-
acceptable  performance  under  § 432.104. 
If the employee offers such documenta-
tion after the agency has proposed a re-
duction  in  grade  or  removal,  he  or  she 
shall  supply  this  information  in  ac-
cordance  with  § 432.105(a)(4)(ii).  In  con-
sidering  documentation  submitted  in 
connection  with  the  employee’s  claim 
of a medical condition, the agency may 
require  or  offer  a  medical  examination 
in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and 
procedures  of  part  339  of  this  chapter, 
and  shall  be  aware  of  the  affirmative 

obligations  of  29  CFR  1613.704.  If  the 
employee  who  raises  a  medical  condi-
tion  has  the  requisite  years  of  service 
under  the  Civil  Service  Retirement 
System  or  the  Federal  Employees  Re-
tirement System, the agency shall pro-
vide  information  concerning  applica-
tion  for  disability  retirement.  As  pro-
vided  at  § 831.501(d)  of  this  chapter,  an 
employee’s  application  for  disability 
retirement  shall  not  preclude  or  delay 
any  other  appropriate  agency  decision 
or personnel action. 

(b)  Final  written  decision.  The  agency 
shall  make  its  final  decision  within  30 
days  after  expiration  of  the  advance 
notice  period.  Unless  proposed  by  the 
head  of  the  agency,  such  written  deci-
sion  shall  be  concurred  in  by  an  em-
ployee who is in a higher position than 
the person who proposed the action. In 
arriving  at  its  decision,  the  agency 
shall  consider  any  answer  of  the  em-
ployee  and/or  his  or  her  representative 
furnished  in  response  to  the  agency’s 
proposal. A decision to reduce in grade 
or  remove  an  employee  for  unaccept-
able performance may be based only on 
those  instances  of  unacceptable  per-
formance  that  occurred  during  the  1 
year  period  ending  on  the  date  of 
issuance  of  the  advance  notice  of  pro-
posed action under § 432.105(a)(4)(i). The 
agency shall issue written notice of its 
decision  to  the  employee  at  or  before 
the  time  the  action  will  be  effective. 
Such notice shall specify the instances 
of  unacceptable  performance  by  the 
employee  on  which  the  action  is  based 
and  shall  inform  the  employee  of  any 
applicable  appeal  and/or  grievance 
rights.

§ 432.107 Agency records. 

(a)  When  the  action  is  effected.  The 
agency  shall  preserve  all  relevant  doc-
umentation  concerning  a  reduction  in 
grade or removal which is based on un-
acceptable  performance  and  make  it 
available for review by the affected em-
ployee  or  his  or  her  representative.  At 
a  minimum,  the  agency’s  records  shall 
consist  of  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  pro-
posed  action,  the  answer  of  the  em-
ployee  when  it  is  in  writing,  a  sum-
mary  thereof  when  the  employee 
makes an oral reply, the written notice 
of  decision  and  the  reasons  therefor, 
and  any  supporting  material  including 
documentation  regarding  the  oppor-
tunity  afforded  the  employee  to  dem-
onstrate acceptable performance. 

(b)  When  the  action  is  not  affected.  As 
provided  at  5  U.S.C.  4303(d),  if,  because 
of  performance  improvement  by  the 
employee during the notice period, the 
employee is not reduced in grade or re-

Thanks JG, no problem, I’m working on an update with my providers, to appropriately capture/document/list 
all of the existing/new/challenging/interesting, issues that have manifested since the surgery. Appreciate 
your assistance..

Good afternoon, 

The FMLA update process being applied in this situation is consistent with policy. Your approved FMLA 
condition of record is the matter being addressed as it relates to the updates being requested. You have 
said in your response that you are not scheduled to see the physician until next year and that you will 
request an appointment and attempt to get one as soon as possible. I will follow up with you in seven (7) 
days to see if you were able to get an appointment for this matter. 

In the meantime I will recommend to your supervisor to continue to approve your current FMLA request 
for the said condition until you have an appointment scheduled. The specifics of the concerns is that your 
current FMLA is approved for 1-3 occurrences every month and you have exceeded the frequency so your 
management is attempting to obtain updated information. 

Thanks for your cooperation with this matter. Please let me know if you have additional questions or 
concerns.

JG,
My next appointment with the VA is 10/29/2019 with the ENT (ear, nose, throat) group at the DeBakey VA 
hospital to attempt to ascertain the source for my recurring dizzy spells.
My next appointment with my primary care physician is next Feb, 2020.
My next appointment with my pulmonary care specialist for my COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease) is also next year.
I will do an online request to see my primary at the Katy VA outpatient clinic, but I’m not sure if that can 
happen within 15 days, it is the VA, so nothing is for certain.
I will also attempt to get an appointment with my primary care private physician in Bellville.
I must admit that as an senior citizen and as an individual who has identified, in the onboarding process, as 
an individual with a disability and when factoring in the very problematic heart surgery and subsequent 
associated health issues, I am concerned about the way the institution and/or individuals within the 
institution, treat those identified as disabled, more specifically, myself.  
If my work was lacking, maybe I could understand, but it isn’t and I don’t understand.  
It does seem that personalities have drifted in to the equation, in my opinion.
I appreciate your assistance and efforts with my disability and during my recovery but, I must admit that it 
has been an extremely distasteful experience with other FEMA personnel.

I will endeavor to get the paperwork returned in a timely manner but I am concerned about the 15 day 
window.

Please advise.

Subject: FMLA Recertification - M. Meindl

Good afternoon Max, 
On May 1, 2019 you were initially approved for FMLA due to a serious/chronic health condition.  Given that 
it has now been more than thirty (30) calendar days since your last medical update for your current FMLA 
condition, I am requesting that you provide me with an FMLA recertification as it relates to your current 
FMLA condition of record.  The recertification is now necessary to ensure that the workload on your team 
can be planned and managed effectively while assisting you during your time of recovery.  Therefore, I am 
requesting that you work with your physician to respond to all questions where appropriate especially those 
related to the questions identified below. These questions are not separate and apart from the recertification 
form but can be responded to within the context of the questions already provided on the form.  (29 CFR 
825.308(a), permits recertification every 30 days for chronic or permanent/long-term conditions.)  
Purpose of this FMLA Recertification Update:
  1. To validate if you are continuing to see the physician for the specific condition listed on your FMLA 
application dated and signed by your physician, on 4/11/2019.      
  2.  Request that you provide an estimate of the duration of your condition & if you will be incapacitated for 
a single continuous period of time.  (See questions #1 & #4).
  3.  Request that you specify what dates, if any, you will have planned appointments within the next 30 days. 
(See Question #5)
  4.  Request that your physician state whether or not you require care on an intermittent or reduced schedule 
basis, including any time for recovery.  (See Question #6)
  5.  Request that your physician provide an estimate of when you will have flare-ups during your recovery 
period (if known) that will prevent you from performing your job functions. (See question #7).
Your health remains of paramount concern to me as well as our mission.  My goal remains to work 
cooperatively with you and your physician in a manner which affords you the best opportunity to recover and 
return to full time employment status.  However, failure to provide this requested FMLA Recertification 
information within fifteen (15) working days of receipt will result in the denial of any FMLA related leave 
until the information is provided. 
If you experience difficulty providing this information within the specified period, please see me, or in my 
absence Patricia David, and provide a brief written statement documenting your hardship and your request 
for extension will be responded to within three (3) working days.

Please describe the nature of your objection to the COVID-19 vaccination requirement. 

QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY, PLACE OF 
WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS UNLAWFUL Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees on the basis of their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an 
employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such 
individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 
U.S. 768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as 
belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections also extend 
nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death. See EEOC, Questions 
and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title VII’s protections also extend to 
those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . 
Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or 
ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious 
views.’ Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are 

religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns 
‘ultimate ideas’ about ‘life, purpose, and death’”). As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious 
beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] 
protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the 
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in 
or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s 
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 
829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a 
specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held 
religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one 
must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office 
of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law 
provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” “not just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law 
provides protection for sincerely held religious beliefs even when some members of the same religious 
organization, sect, or denomination disagree with the beliefs espoused by the individual. That some individuals 
may have sincerely held religious beliefs which differ from those sincerely held by the employees requesting 
accommodation is irrelevant to whether the employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to 
protection under Title VII. Department of Health, in its handout literature for those considering one of the 
COVID-19 vaccines, notes the following: “The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson & 
Johnson did require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the 
vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 2021), 
https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana Department of 
Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is 
a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.” La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have 
Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21, 2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- 
PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 
27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of 
Health’s publications again confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of 
the development of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota 
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology, fetal cells were 
used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D. Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all 
three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are developed and produced from, tested with, researched 
on, or otherwise connected with the aborted fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely 
held religious beliefs compel them to abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their 
bodies, regardless of the perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and 
other adherents whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the 
three currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any employee 
is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many indisputably do. Many 
employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the womb and knows them prior to 
their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment of conception to natural death. See Psalm 
139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, 
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”); Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your 
book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of 
them.”); Isaiah 44:2 (“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus 
says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah 
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah 49:5 (“And 
now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5 (“Before I formed you in 
the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations”). 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, 
or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 

450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly 
sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary 
precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an 
organized religious denomination, especially one with a specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, 
would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim 
the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a particular 
religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in theWilderness, 
329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” 
“not just tenets of organized religion”). The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the 
Currently Available COVID-19 Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this 
section, the Secretary (of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into 
interstate commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or 
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec t2i6o nofa 
6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA Statute]. As an essential 
part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates that all individuals to whom the EUA 
product may be administered be given the option to accept or refuse administration of the product. See 21 
U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that “individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . 
of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available 
COVID-19 vaccines (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use 
under the EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such 
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact Sheets for 
each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to accept or receive the 
vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Moderna 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 25, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis

https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Janssen COVID-
19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)). I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from 
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently 
available alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an 
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His Commandments, 
for which I would be held morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a 
religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that 
will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment 
action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs. A. Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was

QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY, PLACE OF 
WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS UNLAWFUL Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees on the basis of their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an 
employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such 

individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 
U.S. 768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as 
belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections also extend 
nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death. See EEOC, Questions 
and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title VII’s protections also extend to 
those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . 
Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or 
ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious 
views.’ Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are 
religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns 
‘ultimate ideas’ about ‘life, purpose, and death’”). As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious 
beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] 
protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the 
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in 
or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s 
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 
829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a 
specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held 
religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one 
must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office

How long have you held the religious belief underlying your objection? 

QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY, PLACE OF 
WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS UNLAWFUL Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees on the basis of their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an 
employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such 
individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 
U.S. 768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as 
belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections also extend 
nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death. See EEOC, Questions 
and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title VII’s protections also extend to 
those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . 
Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or 
ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious 
views.’ Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are 
religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns 
‘ultimate ideas’ about ‘life, purpose, and death’”). As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious 
beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] 
protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the 
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in 
or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s 
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 
829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a 
specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held 
religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one 
must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office 
of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law 
provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” “not just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law 
provides protection for sincerely held religious beliefs even when some members of the same religious 
organization, sect, or denomination disagree with the beliefs espoused by the individual. That some individuals 
may have sincerely held religious beliefs which differ from those sincerely held by the employees requesting 
accommodation is irrelevant to whether the employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to 
protection under Title VII. Department of Health, in its handout literature for those considering one of the 
COVID-19 vaccines, notes the following: “The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson & 
Johnson did require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the 
vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 2021), 
https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana Department of 
Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is 
a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.” La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have 
Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21, 2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- 
PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 
27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of 
Health’s publications again confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of 
the development of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota 
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology, fetal cells were 
used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D. Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all 
three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are developed and produced from, tested with, researched 
on, or otherwise connected with the aborted fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely 

held religious beliefs compel them to abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their 
bodies, regardless of the perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and 
other adherents whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the 
three currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any employee 
is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many indisputably do. Many 
employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the womb and knows them prior to 
their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment of conception to natural death. See Psalm 
139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, 
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”); Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your 
book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of 
them.”); Isaiah 44:2 (“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus 
says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah 
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah 49:5 (“And 
now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5 (“Before I formed you in 
the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations”). 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, 
or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 
450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly

“not just tenets of organized religion”). The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the 
Currently Available COVID-19 Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this 
section, the Secretary (of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into 
interstate commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or 
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec t2i6o nofa 
6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA Statute]. As an essential 
part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates that all individuals to whom the EUA 
product may be administered be given the option to accept or refuse administration of the product. See 21 
U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that “individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . 
of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available 
COVID-19 vaccines (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use 
under the EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such 
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact Sheets for 
each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to accept or receive the 
vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Moderna 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 25, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis

https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Janssen COVID-
19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)). I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from 
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently 
available alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an 

innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His Commandments, 
for which I would be held morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a 
religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that 
will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment 
action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs. A. Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was

QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A CLERGY, PLACE OF 
WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS UNLAWFUL Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its employees on the basis of their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an 
employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such 
individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 
U.S. 768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as 
belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, Title VII’s protections also extend 
nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, and death. See EEOC, Questions 
and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title VII’s protections also extend to 
those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs . . . . 
Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that include a belief in God as well as non-theistic ‘moral or 
ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious 
views.’ Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are 
religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns 
‘ultimate ideas’ about ‘life, purpose, and death’”). As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious 
beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] 
protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the 
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in 
or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s 
sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 
829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious denomination, especially one with a 
specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held 
religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one 
must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office 
of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law 
provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” “not just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law 
provides protection for sincerely held religious beliefs even when some members of the same religious 
organization, sect, or denomination disagree with the beliefs espoused by the individual. That some individuals 
may have sincerely held religious beliefs which differ from those sincerely held by the employees requesting 

accommodation is irrelevant to whether the employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to 
protection under Title VII. Department of Health, in its handout literature for those considering one of the 
COVID-19 vaccines, notes the following: “The non-replicating viral vector vaccine produced by Johnson & 
Johnson did require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in order to produce and manufacture the 
vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 2021), 
https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana Department of 
Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is 
a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.” La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have 
Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21, 2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- 
PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 
27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of 
Health’s publications again confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of 
the development of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota 
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology, fetal cells were 
used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D. Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all 
three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are developed and produced from, tested with, researched 
on, or otherwise connected with the aborted fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely 
held religious beliefs compel them to abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their 
bodies, regardless of the perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and 
other adherents whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the 
three currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any employee 
is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many indisputably do. Many 
employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the womb and knows them prior to 
their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment of conception to natural death. See Psalm 
139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, 
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”); Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your 
book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of 
them.”); Isaiah 44:2 (“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus 
says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah 
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah 49:5 (“And 
now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5 (“Before I formed you in 
the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations”). 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, 
or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 
450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly

329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” 
“not just tenets of organized religion”). The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the 
Currently Available COVID-19 Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this 
section, the Secretary (of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into 
interstate commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or 
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec t2i6o nofa 
6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA Statute]. As an essential 
part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates that all individuals to whom the EUA 

product may be administered be given the option to accept or refuse administration of the product. See 21 
U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that “individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . 
of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available 
COVID-19 vaccines (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use 
under the EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such 
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact Sheets for 
each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to accept or receive the 
vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Moderna 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 25, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Janssen, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (July 8, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Janssen COVID-
19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)). I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from 
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently 
available alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an 
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His Commandments, 
for which I would be held morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a 
religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that 
will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment 
action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs. A. Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was

precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an 
organized religious denomination, especially one with a specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, 
would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim 
the protection [for sincerely held religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a particular 

religious organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in theWilderness, 
329 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” 
“not just tenets of organized religion”). The Emergency Use Authorization Statute Prohibits Mandating the 
Currently Available COVID-19 Vaccines: The United States Code provides: [S]ubject to the provisions of this 
section, the Secretary (of the Department of Health and Human Services) may authorize the introduction into 
interstate commerce, during the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), of a drug, device, or 
biological product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency (referred to in thiPsasgeec t2i6o nofa 
6s3an “emergency use.” 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1) (emphasis added) [hereinafter EUA Statute]. As an essential 
part of the explicit statutory conditions for EUA, the EUA Statute mandates that all individuals to whom the EUA 
product may be administered be given the option to accept or refuse administration of the product. See 21 
U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) (requiring that “individual to whom the product is administered are informed . . . 
of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product” (emphasis added)). The only currently available 
COVID-19 vaccines (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech) are only authorized for use 
under the EUA Statute and have no general approval under federal law. Thus, the administration of such 
vaccines cannot be mandatory under the plain text of the EUA Statute. The statutorily required Fact Sheets for 
each of the EUA COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that individuals cannot be compelled to accept or receive the 
vaccine. See Moderna, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 24, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Moderna 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Pfizer-BioNTech, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (June 25, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)); Janssen, Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (July 8, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download (“It is your choice to receive or not to receive the Janssen COVID-
19 Vaccine. Should you decide not to receive it, it will not change your standard medical care.” (emphasis 
added)). I have a strong moral and sincere religious beliefs and objection to vaccines that were derived from 
aborted fetal cells. It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently 
available alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an 
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His Commandments, 
for which I would be held morally accountable by God. For that reason, I am demanding a medical and a 
religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that 
will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment 
action be taken against me on account of my religious beliefs. A. Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was

See attachments QUESTIONING THE ORTHODOXY OF SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR REQUIRING A 
CLERGY, PLACE OF WORSHIP, OR A THIRD PARTY TO AGREE WITH OR AFFIRM SUCH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS 
UNLAWFUL Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against its 
employees on the basis of their sincerely held religious beliefs. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an 
unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or 
otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”); see also 
EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768 (2015) (same). Title VII defines “religion” as “all aspects of 
religious observance and practice, as well as belief.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e(j). Moreover, as the EEOC has made clear, 
Title VII’s protections also extend nonreligious beliefs if related to morality, ultimate ideas about life, purpose, 
and death. See EEOC, Questions and Answers: Religious Discrimination in the Workplace (June 7, 2008), (“Title 
VII’s protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they 
profess no religious beliefs . . . . Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs, i.e. those that include a belief in God as 
well as non-theistic ‘moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the 

strength of traditional religious views.’ Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor 
of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, 
religion typically concerns ‘ultimate ideas’ about ‘life, purpose, and death’”). As the Supreme Court has 
recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to 
others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 
(1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (same). 
Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly sufficient to 
provide protection for an individual’s sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary precondition. See 
Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an organized religious 
denomination, especially one with a specific tenet forbidding members to work on Sunday, would simplify the 
problem of identifying sincerely held religious beliefs, but we reject the notion that to claim the protection [for 
sincerely held religious beliefs], one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious 
organization.” (emphasis added)); see also Office of Foreign Assets Control v. Voices in the Wilderness, 329 F. 
Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2004) (noting that the law provides protection for “sincerely held religious beliefs,” “not 
just tenets of organized religion”). In fact, the law provides protection for sincerely held religious beliefs even 
when some members of the same religious organization, sect, or denomination disagree with the beliefs 
espoused by the individual. That some individuals may have sincerely held religious beliefs which differ from 
those sincerely held by the employees requesting accommodation is irrelevant to whether the employees’ 
sincerely held religious beliefs are entitled to protection under Title VII. Department of Health, in its handout 
literature for those considering one of the COVID-19 vaccines, notes the following: “The non-replicating viral 
vector vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson did require the use of fetal cell cultures, specifically PER.C6, in 
order to produce and manufacture the vaccine.” N.D. Health, COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines (Apr. 20, 
2021), https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/COVID%20Vaccine%20Page/COVID-
19_Vaccine_Fetal_Cell_Handout.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 27, 2021). The Louisiana Department of 
Health likewise confirms that the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine used the PER.C6 fetal cell line, which “is 
a retinal cell line that was isolated from a terminated fetus in 1985.” La. Dep’t of Public Health, You Have 
Questions, We Have Answers: COVID-19 Vaccine FAQ (Dec. 21, 2020), https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center- 
PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/You_Have_Qs_COVID-19_Vaccine_FAQ.pdf (emphasis added) (last visited Aug. 
27, 2021). The same is true of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines. The Louisiana Department of 
Health’s publications again confirm that aborted fetal cells lines were used in the “proof of concept” phase of 
the development of their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See La. Dep’t of Public Health, supra. The North Dakota 
Department of Health likewise confirms: “Early in the development of mRNA vaccine technology, fetal cells were 
used for ‘proof of concept’ (to demonstrate how a cell could take up mRNA and produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein) or to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.” N.D. Health, supra (emphasis added). Because all 
three of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are developed and produced from, tested with, researched 
on, or otherwise connected with the aborted fetal cell lines HEK-293 and PER.C6, many employees’ sincerely 
held religious beliefs compel them to abstain from accepting or injecting any of these products into their 
bodies, regardless of the perceived benefits or rationales. Thus, while there may be some faith leaders and 
other adherents whose understanding of Scripture is different, and who may be willing to accept one of the 
three currently available COVID-19 vaccines despite their connection with aborted fetal cell lines, any employee 
is entitled to interpret the Scriptural command against murder differently, which many indisputably do. Many 
employees have sincerely held religious beliefs that God forms children in the womb and knows them prior to 
their birth, and that because of this, life is sacred from the moment of conception to natural death. See Psalm 
139:13–14 (ESV) (“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, 
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”); Psalm 139:16 (ESV) (“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your 
book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of 
them.”); Isaiah 44:2 (“Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb”); Isaiah 44:24 (“Thus 
says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: ‘I am the Lord, who made all things’”); Isaiah 
49:1 (“The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name”); Isaiah 49:5 (“And 
now the Lord says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,”); Jeremiah 1:5 (“Before I formed you in 
the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations”). 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, employees’ “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, 

or comprehensible to others in order to merit [legal] protection.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 
450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 
(1993) (same). Additionally, though membership in or adherence to the tenets of an organized religion is plainly 
sufficient to provide protection for an individual’s sincerely held religious beliefs, it is not a necessary 
precondition. See Frazee v. Ill. Dep’t of Emp’t Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) (“Undoubtedly, membership in an

Briefly describe your disability/medical condition. 

Disability review regarding Mr. Max Meindl who is a 70-year-old male with CAD, HTN, HLD and severe 
hypotension following the cardiac surgery...of 04/20l9_. He also has had proximal LAD with hematemesis. He 
has a history of exposure to paint, chemicals and asbestos with additional complications including dizziness 
since the surgery and wheezing. He has ongoing mild cardiac reduction in diffusion capacity. Additionally he has 
allergies that include contrast media, amlodipine and lisinopril. Mr. MeindI presently carries a 100% total body 
disability impairment rating as per his prior evaluations and surgeries. Current Condition: Shortness of breath, 
hypertensive urgency, other forms of dyspnea, unilateral primary osteoa1ihritis, right knee, high blood 
pressure, hypertensive heart disease, lung disorders, supraventricular rapid heart rate, chest pain, angina, 
abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), (EKG), atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery causing 
unspecific angina pectoris. Additionally, he has abnormal results of cardiovascular functional studies. Mr. 
Meindl' s current medical condition and medical history is consistent with Congestive Heart failure. Given Mr. 
Meindl's Cardiac history of progressive heart disease together with known allergic reactions he therefore 
should not take any substance internally or intravenously that could cause anaphylaxis shock or could be 
additionally injurious to his already compromised cardiac function. PEG's have a high correlation between 
allergies and anaphylaxis shock. This is further complicated in that due to the vaccines spike protein production 
that is engineered into the user's genome, each such recipient of the Covid-19 Vaccines can produce micro clots 
in their cardiovascular system, which considering Mr. Meindl's cardiac condition, poses a higher risk of 
complications and injury. 

Briefly describe the specific accommodation requested 

Permanent exemption from any vaccine mandate 

Please explain how your disability or medical condition prevents you from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, 
addressing each type available (Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer). 

Due to previous cardiac surgery, hypertensive heart disease causing ongoing cardiac reduction and previously 
known allergic reactions with a history of exposure to contrast media, amlodipine and lisinopril that there is a 
high degree of probability that he would be allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and its components as part of 
the Covid -19 vaccine. Additionally, there is ongoing data that suggests that Covid- 19 Vaccines can damage the 
cardiovascular system, which is irreparable and irrevocable. Mr. Meindl's current medical condition and medical 
history is consistent with Congestive Heart failure. Given Mr. Meindl"s Cardiac history of progressive heart 
disease together with known allergic reactions he therefore should not take any substance internally or 
intravenously that could cause anaphylaxis shock or could be additionally injurious to his already compromised 
cardiac function. PEG's have a high correlation between allergies and anaphylaxis shock. This is further 
complicated in that due to the vaccines spike protein production that is engineered into the user's genome, 
each such recipient of the Covid-19 Vaccines can produce micro clots in their cardiovascular system, which 
considering Mr. Meindl's cardiac condition, poses a higher risk of complications and injury. Additionally, 
according to the Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine BNTI 62b2 Manufacturers package leaflet, revised on 09/09/2021, 
"Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine" stating that inflammation of the heart (myocarditis or pericarditis) have been 
reported following vaccination. This would certainly apply to Mr. Meindl. Therefore, Mr. Meindl is ineligible for 
any mRNA or Adenovirus Covid 19 Vaccine. 2.4. Four Immunological Problems with COVID-19 Vaccines. The 
Emergency Use experimental gene therapy shots, colloquially and collectively called “Covid Vaccines,” various 
parties are requiring you to receive are, in fact, designed to alter, impair and abrogate “normal cell growth” by 
virtue of the genetic modifications made to your body that cause the production of Spike proteins (sometimes 
“S-cells”);1 and as such may not be administered without express consent, whether the injectables or drugs are 

approved by the FDA or not. Broadly, the Act describes rights of disabled persons (the “Disabled”) and 
obligations of persons (legal and natural) interacting with the Disabled under Federal law, which is often further 
clarified under various States’ laws. One such right of the Disabled (such as yourself), provides for certain 
medical privacy protections that may be additionally regulated in companion statutes such as The Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). The HIPPA statute, inter alia, protects your right 
for non-disclose of the nature and extent of your medical issues and disabilities to third parties. Once the ADA 
protections and rights are asserted, all persons, including third-parties and entities conceived or covered by the 
Act must provide you with “reasonable accommodation” under Section under Sec. 12111 (9) & (10) ibid. The 
covered entities include effectively all enterprises, schools or offices open to the public or where sufficient 
elements of interstate commerce are present. This includes all offices of local, state or federal governmental 
bodies, including but not limited to: detention facilities; government funded health care facilities; regulatory 
offices open to the public; Law Enforcement facilities; and legislative areas where the public would reasonably 
be anticipated to occasion or occupy. Likewise, private enterprises such as hospitals, hotels, restaurants, shops 
and airlines must provide such Reasonable Accommodation to you and your circumstances as a “disabled 
person” under the Act. In particular, you have suggested the mask mandates cause you medical hardship from 
the reduced access to and flow of oxygen available to you. Such accommodation certainly includes your ability 
to breathe freely without impairment, which could or would be caused by mandatory mask or filter apparatus 
wearing, as mandated by private businesses or public offices that you have occasion to visit. Such 
accommodations are recognized by the Act and are referred to as “Public Accommodations” under Title III of 
the Act. Failure to provide such accommodation may give rise, inter alia, to significant penalties (see: Title III 
supra.) and provide the basis for damage awards. Likewise, you have mentioned that protocols and 
methodologies relating to the taking of DNA samples for the “Covid 19”Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) test 
are painful, intrusive and exacerbate existing medical conditions. Recently, the PCR tests were recalled and 
were never intended for diagnostic purposes to begin with. Certainly DNA material for the tests need not come 
from your nasal passages alone; therefore you have no reason to undertake such a test as traditionally applied. 
Clearly there are other ways to accommodate your needs. While the now clearly established widespread cross-
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 implies that most of us are safe from severe COVID-19 disease, it also means that 
we are vulnerable to the harms of gene- based vaccines. Due to recall immunity against the virus, vaccination 
will cause our immune systems to fight aggressively against not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but against 
ourselves. This deleterious autoimmune attack must be expected to intensify with each repeated injection. The 
COVID-19 vaccine technology’s interaction with the immune system creates the following four specific 
problems: 1. Flying under the immune system’s radar with the vaccine’s genetic code 2. Delivering the spike 
protein into the bloodstream 3. Inducing immune attack on the blood vessel lining 4. Enhancing the severity of 
natural infection 2.4.1. Flying Under the Immune System’s Radar with the Vaccine’s Genetic Code To understand 
why COVID-19 vaccine technology is dangerous, it is necessary to first understand how the gene-based vaccines 
differ from traditional vaccination methods. A conventional viral vaccine can be a live virus strain derived from 
the pathogenic virus that has been attenuated through one or more genetic mutations, or it can consist of 
chemically inactivated virus particles that are no longer able to infect any cells. In both cases, protein antigens 
will be exposed on the surface of the vaccine particles, which can be recognized by antibodies once these have 
been formed. COVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, are not protein antigens but the genetic blueprint for the 
SARS- CoV-2 spike protein antigen. That blueprint comes in the form of mRNA or DNA, which, after vaccination, 
enters our body’s cells and instructs those cells to manufacture the spike protein. The spike protein then 
protrudes from the cell and induces antibody formation. In response, the immune system will react not only 
with the spike protein, but will attack and try to destroy the entire cell. If we are injected with a traditional live 
virus vaccine to which we have no immunity, then these vaccine virus particles will also infect some of our body 
cells and propagate within them. Two kinds of immune reactions will then occur: 1. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes 
(killer T-cells) (see section 2.4.3.1) that recognize viral protein fragments associated with the infected cells will 
proliferate, attack, and destroy the infected cells. 2. B-lymphocytes that recognize viral proteins (see section 
2.4.3.2) will proliferate and start producing antibodies—soluble protein molecules that can recognize and 
neutralize virus particles. This immune reaction will in principle resemble that to an infection with the 
corresponding wild-type virus. It will be milder, since the vaccine strain of the virus has been attenuated; 
however, some cells will get destroyed in the process, which may sometimes cause functional organ damage. 

Live virus vaccines therefore tend to be more prone to adverse reactions than are inactivated virus vaccines. 
Now, a key point to note is that if we inject a live traditional vaccine into a person who is already immune —due 
to either a previous vaccination, or to prior infection with the corresponding wild-type virus—the extent of cell 
destruction will be much reduced. Such a person will already have antibodies to the virus; these will recognize 
the viral protein antigens and will bind and inactivate most of the vaccine virus particles before they manage to 
infect a cell. Therefore, even though the killer T-cells may be all riled up, they will not find very many infected 
cells to pounce on. The crucial difference between a conventional live virus vaccine and a gene-based COVID 
vaccine—and in particular an mRNA vaccine—is that the latter contains no protein antigens whatsoever; 
instead, it only contains the blueprint for their synthesis inside the infected cells. Therefore, if such a vaccine is 
injected into a person with antibodies and existing T-cell immunity, the vaccine particles will “fly under the 
radar” of the antibody defence and reach our body cells unimpeded. The cells will then produce the spike 
protein, and subsequently be destroyed and attacked by the killer T-cells. The antibodies, rather than 
preventing the carnage, will join in by also binding to the cell-associated spike protein and directing the 
complement system (see later) and other immune effector mechanisms against these cells. In a nutshell, pre-
existing immunity mitigates the risk of conventional vaccines, but it amplifies the risk of gene-based vaccines. 
Importantly, before COVID, this risky gene-based vaccine technology had never before been used on a wide 
scale against infectious disease and is inherently experimental. The COVID-19 vaccination program is thus the 
largest human experiment ever performed in history. 2.4.2. Delivering the Spike Protein into the Bloodstream A 
dire danger of COVID-19 vaccines is that spike proteins produced by myriad endothelial cells, i.e. the innermost 
cells lining blood vessel walls, will be exported to the cell surface and protrude directly into the bloodstream. 
Moreover, a fraction of these spikes will be cleaved during their passage to the outside world. They will fall off 
the cells into the bloodstream and then bind to their receptors on other endothelial cells at distant sites. While 
at the outset of the vaccination campaign in 2020 it was unknown to what extent COVID vaccines entered the 
bloodstream, human data from 2021 reveal that the spike protein shows up within the circulation on the very 
day of the injection [15]. Similarly, animal studies submitted by Pfizer to the Japanese government [24] found 
that the vaccine appears in the circulation within 15 minutes of intramuscular injection, reaching maximum 
plasma concentration within just two hours. Very high levels have subsequently been recorded in the liver, the 
spleen, the adrenal glands, and the ovaries. Vaccine components have also been observed in the central 
nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord), albeit at lower concentrations. Such widespread distribution 
throughout the body via the bloodstream is a feat that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not usually achieve. 2.4.2.1. 
Open Questions in the Ongoing Experiment But how do COVID-19 vaccine particles enter the circulation in the 
first place? The vaccine is injected intramuscularly, and the vaccine particles are too large to passively diffuse 
across blood vessel walls. Most obviously, the vaccines will follow the conventional, relatively time-consuming 
path which takes them via the draining lymph nodes to the blood circulation. But additionally, two possibilities 
for very rapid entry into the bloodstream should be heeded. The first is via direct uptake by vessels that are 
damaged during insertion of the needle. Secondly, it is possible that the vaccine particles undergo ‘transcytosis’, 
a process that enables large molecules to be transported across intact cell layers. Whatever the case may be, 
although Pfizer knew before the onset of clinical trials that their vaccine reached the bloodstream rapidly, 
either they failed to file these findings with medical regulators in Europe, the US and other Western countries, 
or the regulators failed to act upon the findings [25]. This is a critical oversight where patient safety is 
concerned. Given that the gene-based vaccines induce the body’s cells to become immune targets, where in the 
body this takes place is of critical concern. While immune-mediated cell death is never favourable, it is 
particularly detrimental and dangerous if it afflicts the blood vessel walls. 2.4.3. Attacking the Vessel Walls: 
Clotting and Leaky Vessels While all vaccines seek to stimulate an immune response, not all immune responses 
are created equal. Some are safe and well-modulated whereas others can be misdirected and out of control. 
Immune responses are problematic when they attack the self, as in autoimmune conditions, and/or when they 
are excessively intense and severe. COVID-19 vaccines incur problematic immunity in both key ways. First, they 
can be expected mobilise a self-to-self immune response against the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. 
Second, by boosting SARS-CoV-2 immunity, they can be expected to incite an increasingly aggressive response 
with each administration of the vaccine. To understand the realities of these processes it is necessary to first 
understand the basics of the underlying immune response. There are three key components of the immune 
system relevant to risks from COVID- 19 vaccines: T-cells, antibodies and the complement cascade. 2.4.3.1. T-

cells Once the body’s cells have been infected with a virus, immune cells known as cytotoxic T-cells or T-killer 
cells attack and destroy the infected cells. This prevents infected cells from replicating the virus and spreading 
the infection throughout the body. After the initial battle with a certain pathogen is over, some of the 
specifically adapted T-cells enter a state of dormancy to become memory T-cells. In case the same virus is 
encountered again, these dormant T-cells can be swiftly reawakened and propagated to mount a faster and 
more vigorous response next time. Known as a secondary or memory-type response, it will also occur with 
viruses that are not exactly the same as the one initially encountered but sufficiently similar to be recognised. 
This latter phenomenon is referred to as cross-immunity. It has been known since mid 2020 that we are 
protected against SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive memory T-cells [7–11]. As with antibodies, this is based on 
previous encounters with common cold coronaviruses, and with the SARS virus in a small number of people. 
Such prior experience has been found to confer “robust” [7] and lasting T-cell cross-immunity to COVID-19. T-
cell memory for the SARS virus is known to last at least 17 years [7], but it likely lasts a lifetime. 2.4.3.2. 
Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’ concerns about clotting and bleeding were based 
primarily on the prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial cells, causing lesions on 
vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-
type antibody response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer T-cells attack their targets 
cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s 
surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once attached to an epitope, antibodies help to 
defeat invaders by “calling out the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which cells 
coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the 
antibodies attached to the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement system, which 
thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent 
discoveries on SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen, new 
antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes must be formed (by immune cells known 
as B-cells). First-time antibody production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same pathogen 
or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, 
within one to two weeks. This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen before. 
Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns the order in which antibody sub-types are 
produced. If a pathogen is new, IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed later by IgG 
and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the 
virus, or its relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see with COVID-19. Several 
research groups found in 2021 that upon first exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the 
antibody response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and nature of antibodies 
measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even 
“on the slightest viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel coronavirus after all. With respect 
to variants and the need for booster shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a 
specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that memory 
B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of SARS-
CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations 
and deaths attributed to Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false positive PCR 
results and misclassification than by a true increase in COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health 
England data, the Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as lethal as earlier strains in 
older age groups [26]. But why haven’t circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations 
before? The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a memory-type response circulate 
in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. 
Unless elicited by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The dormant antibodies will, 
however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the 
complement cascade. 2.4.3.3. Complement Recent findings indicate that complement activation is a serious 
concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions. In light of the newly characterised antibody 
response to SARS-CoV-2, when antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls following 
vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be expected attach to the endothelial cells, and 
perforate their cell membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose the tissue 

underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause 
the vessel walls to leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken from SARS-
CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a “catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome 
mediated by activation of complement” [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response. It is 
precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to induce. Such vaccine-immune interactions are 
consistent with adverse events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been documented 
and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30–33]. 2.4.3.4. Leaky Vessels—The Promise of Booster Shots 
Given that booster shots repeatedly boost the immune response to the spike protein, they will progressively 
boost self-to-self immune attack, including boosting complement-mediated damage to vessel walls. Clinically 
speaking, the greater the vessel leakage and clotting that subsequently occurs, the more likely that organs 
supplied by the affected blood flow will sustain damage. From stroke to heart attack to brain vein thrombosis, 
the symptoms can range from death to headaches, nausea and vomiting, all of which heavily populate adverse 
reactions to COVID-19 vaccines [2]. As well as damage from leakage and clotting alone, it is additionally possible 
that the vaccine itself may leak into surrounding organs and tissues. Should this take place, the cells of those 
organs will themselves begin to produce spike protein, and will come under attack in the same way as the 
vessel walls. Damage to major organs such as the lungs, ovaries, placenta and heart can be expected ensue, 
with increasing severity and frequency as booster shots are rolled out. 2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild 
Coronavirus Infection Finally, as with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to 
coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This is called antibody-dependent 
enhancement of disease. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the 
net effects are severely detrimental. Attempts to develop vaccines to the original SARS virus, which is closely 
related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35–37]. The 
vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were subsequently infected with the wild-type 
virus, they became more ill than the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38]. References 1. Open

World Medical Association, (2017) WMA Declaration of Geneva Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin, 
ENDS COVID almost overnight (27 October 2021) The ongoing COVID-19 nonsense here in the United States 
exists solely and exclusively because our governments have failed to use the correct treatment. They used so-
called "vaccines" when Japan has just proven, in less than ONE MONTH, that Ivermectin can wipe out the 
disease. Sweden's Public Health Agency on Wednesday recommended a temporary halt to the use of the 
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects to the heart. It said the 
pause should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk 
of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium 
(pericarditis). {link to CBS News (Secure)] Finland, Denmark and Norway have also moved away from the COVID 
vaccines. Finland last Thursday joined Sweden, Denmark and Norway in recommending against use of Moderna 
Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine in younger age groups, citing risks of rare cardiovascular side effects they said warranted 
the precautionary steps. Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said last Thursday it would pause use of the 
Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30, following a similar step last Wednesday by Swedish 
regulators. Denmark last Wednesday said it wouldn’t offer the Moderna vaccine to under-18s as a 
precautionary measure. Norway on Wednesday advised that all under-18s shouldn’t be given the Moderna 
vaccine, even if they had already received one dose, and recommended that men under 30 consider getting the 
vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech instead. Norwegian officials cited U.S., Canadian and Nordic 
data, saying the absolute risks remain low and calling the advice “a precautionary measure.” The European 
Medicines Agency said Thursday that new preliminary data from the Nordic countries supports a warning the 
agency adopted in July that inflammatory heart conditions called myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very 
rare cases following vaccination with Covid-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. By far, however, 
the absolute superstar among foreign nations dealing with COVID is Japan. Japan has PULLED the vaccines and 
substituted Ivermectin - and in one month, wiped COVID out in that country! * Safe? Japan pulls Moderna vax, 
ends nationwide vax drive after “magnetic” “metals” found to contaminate jabs: [link to asia.nikkei.com (secure)] 
* Three lots of Moderna jabs recalled in Japan over stainless steel contamination: * Several Japanese cities 
report white stuff floating in jab vials: * Japan minister of health tells docs to recommend IVM: [link to 
rclutz.com (secure)] * Japan now a MAJOR SUCCESS STORY after it BEATS COVID rapidly: [link to www.msn.com 
(secure)] Any questions? Just so you understand the timeline. By September deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine 
jabs were being investigated. At roughly that time, the vials were under scrutiny and metal "magnetic" material 
was found in them. Very shortly thereafter, the Japanese minister of health announced doctors could prescribe 
Ivermectin. A month later, the Western press is shocked that COVID has all but disappeared from the island. 
Get it? Understand? This is what it looks like in a country that still has rule of law. The governemnt responds to 

reports of death and contaminated vaxes, moves to real treatment, people get better, and the virus disappears. 
Now compare that to what is happening in the United States and in Australia and New Zealand. All three 
countries are in dismal failure in their handling of COVID-19, and that failure has resulted in staggering loss of 
freedom and destruction of commerce. This is the biggest news story right now. Japan has ended COVID. It did 
it after it stopped the vax rollout and went to Ivermectin. Period. Hard stop. REFERENCES [1] “There are

explained Page 22 of 63 [8]‘Over more than 3 decades, promising lipids studied in the lab often failed to live up 
to their potential when tested in animals or humans. Positively charged lipids are inherently toxic, and 
companies struggled for years before landing on formulations that were safe and effective. When injected 
intravenously, the particles invariably accumulated in the liver, and delivery to other organs is still an obstacle. 
Reliably manufacturing consistent LNPs was another challenge, and producing the raw materials needed to 
make the particles is a limiting factor in the production of COVID-19 vaccines today.’ Without these lipid shells, 
there would be no mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, by Ryan Cross, Chemical & Engineering News, March 6, 2021.

360bbb-3 https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360bbb-3 How will vaccine recipients be informed about 
the benefits and risks of any vaccine that receives an EUA? FDA must ensure that recipients of the vaccine 
under an EUA are informed, to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances, that FDA has 
authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the known and potential benefits and risks, the extent to which 
such benefits and risks are unknown, that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and of any 
available alternatives to the product. Typically, this information is communicated in a patient “fact sheet.” The 
FDA posts these fact sheets on our website. https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-
