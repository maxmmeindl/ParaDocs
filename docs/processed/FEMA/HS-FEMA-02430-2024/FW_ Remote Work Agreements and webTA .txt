Hello, 

After verifying with payroll, we need to ensure the webTA transaction codes are updated for those
who have remote work agreements. 
Please advise your teams to update their default schedules to 01-Remote Work Regular Time.

One way to update:
From Employee Main Menu
Select Default Schedule
Select New 
Select Transaction Code: 01-Remote Work Regular Time (approx. 3/4 of the way down the list)
Save
Select Edit – update accounting line as applicable
Update hours to reflect schedule

Delete any Telework Home and Regular Base Pay lines 

Note: The transaction would remain the same (but the accounting line would be different) if
deployed virtually. 

I’m around 6:30am-3:00pm CST if assistance is needed – TEAMs would be best to share screens.
