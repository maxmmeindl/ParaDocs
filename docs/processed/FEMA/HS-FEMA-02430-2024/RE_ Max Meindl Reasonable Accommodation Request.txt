Mark,
Pursuant to the following, as stipulated by Andrew:

Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%?
If so, was it a 90 day approval?
Dates needed to show when approval was recorded. (Depending on length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable
accommodation request might not be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

Subject: Max Meindl Reasonable Accommodation Request

Good Afternoon –

I have been tasked with verifying accountability for all staff scheduled to be in office on their designated days for the Houston office. I
understand there is a pending Reasonable Accommodation request for Max. Below is an outline of the steps necessary to determine next
action items for Max in the process re: his selected days in office for the Houston campus, as advised through discussion with Mission
Support.

When did employee initiate the Reasonable Accommodation request? Determine how long he has been out of the office.

Identify employee’s RA specialist (person tasked with his RA request since beginning process) and reach out to them about the pending
request. If specific person cannot be located then email stated inquiries to the Reasonable Accommodations mailbox.

Inquire where in the process the request is. What items, documents, or other necessary items are necessary to complete the process
for request to be satisfied.  

Additionally, has employee been approved by SOR to telework from residence 100%? If so, was it a 90 day approval? Dates needed to
show when approval was recorded. (Depending on length of time and if considered temporary, a reasonable accommodation request
might not be necessary with SOR’s approval.)

I am attempting to answer some of Max’s questions on next steps he needs to take and identify how the request can be settled through the
proper guidelines we were given. If further clarification is needed please reach out to Karina Aguilo from Mission Support to advise.  

Thank you,
