FEMA REASONABLE 
ACCCOMMODATION PROGRAM  
FEMA Directive – FD-256-022-03 

BACKGROUND 
FEMA must fully comply with the reasonable accommodation requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 
(ADAAA), Executive Order (EO) 13164, and other applicable federal regulations and 
guidelines, regarding providing accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities. 
FEMA must provide reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental 
disabilities of applicants and qualified employees, unless FEMA demonstrates that the 
accommodation would impose an undue hardship. 

The provisions of this Directive apply to all applicants and employees who meet the 
definition of “employee” under 5 U.S.C. § 2105. This Directive also applies to applicants 
and employees hired under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act, as amended, codified at 42 U.S.C.§§ 5121 et seq.  

This Directive supersedes FEMA MANUAL FM 123-6-1, Reasonable Accommodation 
Program, January 28, 2015. 

PURPOSE 
This Directive establishes the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA or the 
Agency) policy and procedures for reasonable accommodation as it pertains to applicants 
for employment and employees. 

PRINCIPLES 
FEMA will process requests for reasonable accommodation as outlined in this policy, and 
as appropriate, provide a reasonable accommodation to the applicant or employee in a way 
that is consistent with the FEMA Core Values with an emphasis on fairness, efficiency, and 
speed. 

Fairness: All requests for reasonable accommodation submitted to the Office of Equal 
Rights (OER) Disability Unit will be reviewed in a fair and impartial manner. 

Timeliness: All reasonable accommodation requests will be processed in a reasonable 
and timely manner, in the absence of extenuating circumstances.

The SPPC is responsible for the following: 

a.  Reassignment 

i.  Work with the employee requesting the accommodation to determine if there are 
vacant, funded positions within FEMA for which the employee is qualified, with or 
without reasonable accommodation. 

ii.  When such a position is not available, the SPPC will expand its search for 

vacancies to other DHS components. 

iii.  Failure by the employee to engage in the reassignment process after being 

iv. 

contacted by OCCHCO, will result in FEMA moving forward with termination.  
If a position is not identified, the employee will be notified of the negative search 
results by the SPPC, and the process for removal of the employee from the 
agency will be initiated, as they are no longer able to perform the essential 
functions of their position with or without a reasonable accommodation.  The 
SOR will work with OCCHCO to initiate the removal process.  More information 
about the reassignment process is in FEMA Instruction 256-022-01, Reasonable 
Accommodation Program. 

9.  Office of Chief Counsel/Personnel Law Branch (PLB): Provides legal advice and 

guidance to management officials and Disability Program Manager, when requested, on 
issues related to requests for reasonable accommodations. 

10.  Office of Chief Counsel/Embedded Counsel in OER: Provides day-to-day legal advice 

and guidance to the OER Disability Unit on the accommodation process, including legal 
review of the approval and denial of accommodation requests. 

DISTRIBUTION 
These procedures must be distributed to all employees upon issuance. They also must be 
posted on FEMA’s intranet and internet sites. Copies of these procedures will also be 
available from OER and OCCHCO. 

INQUIRIES

Deciding Official: An individual of authority who determines, after consultation with the OER 
Disability Unit, whether an accommodation request will be approved or denied, or whether 
an alternative accommodation will be provided. The Deciding Official must be the 
supervisor of record (SOR) or another designated official. 

1.  The OER Disability Program Manager (DPM) is the Deciding Official for accommodation 

requests for applicants for employment. 

2.  For deployed employees, the Deciding Official is the SOR who will communicate the 

approved accommodation to the appropriate Temporary Duty Supervisor (TDS) and the 
Cadre Coordinator. 

3.  For Surge Capacity Workforce, the TDS is the Deciding Official and must coordinate 

with the OER Disability Unit. 

4.  For all others, the Deciding Official may be the SOR or another designated official within 

the employees chain of command. 

Disability:  

1.  A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; 

2.  A record of such an impairment; or  

3.  Being regarded as having such an impairment. 

The definition of "disability" should be interpreted broadly. The question of whether an 
individual’s impairment is a disability under the Rehabilitation Act will not demand extensive 
analysis. Only qualified individuals with a current disability are entitled to a reasonable 
accommodation. Individuals who have a record of an impairment that is no longer limiting a 
major life activity are not entitled to an accommodation.  

Emotional Support Animal (ESA): An animal that is prescribed by a licensed mental health 
professional to a person with a disabling mental condition to relieve the symptoms 
associated with their mental health condition. Emotional support animals are not 
recognized as service animals under the ADA because they are not seen as "working 
animals." However, FEMA will consider requests for an ESA as a reasonable 
accommodation on a case-by-case basis.   

Employees: A Permanent Full-Time Employee (PFT), Temporary Full-Time Employee 
(TFT), Part-Time Employee, Cadre on On-call Response/Recovery Employee (CORE), 
Reservist, or Local Hire. 

Essential Functions: Those job duties so fundamental to the position that the individual 
holds or desires that they cannot do the job without performing them. A function can be 
“essential” if, among other things, the position exists specifically to perform that function; 
there are a limited number of other employees who could perform the function; and/or the 
function is highly specialized, and the individual is hired based on their expertise or ability

to perform it. Determination of the essential functions of a position must be done on a case-
by-case basis so that it reflects the job as actually performed, and not simply the 
components of a generic position description. 

Extenuating Circumstances: Factors that could not reasonably have been anticipated or 
avoided in advance of the request for accommodation or limited situations in which 
unforeseen or unavoidable events prevent prompt processing of a request and delivery of 
an approved accommodation. 

Functional Limitation: A restriction or condition that limits a person’s ability to function in a 
way that falls within the normal range for the activity.   

Interactive Process: A discussion with an applicant or employee who has requested an 
accommodation (or otherwise indicated a need) in order to clarify the specific nature of the 
disability and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation. 

Interim Accommodation: A temporary or short-term solution when an approved 
accommodation cannot be implemented immediately.  

Major Life Activities: Basic activities that most people in the general population can perform 
with little or no difficulty. Major life activities include, but are not limited to: caring for 
oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, 
sitting, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, 
communicating, interacting with others, working, or the operation of a major bodily function, 
including functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin, normal cell 
growth, and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, 
circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive 
01functions. 

Medical Documentation: Documentation provided by a licensed medical practitioner 
describing the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment; the workplace 
activities the impairment limits; the extent to which the condition limits the individual’s ability 
to perform said activities; and substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation 
is needed.  

Personal Assistant Services (PAS): Assistance with performing activities of daily living that 
an individual would typically perform if they did not have a targeted disability, and that is not 
otherwise required as a reasonable accommodation. PAS must be performed by a personal 
assistance service provider.  

Physical or mental impairment: Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic 
disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as:  
neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory (including speech organs); 
cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; immune; circulatory; hemic; 
lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or any mental or psychological disorder, such as intellectual 
disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning 
disabilities.

conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing loss, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, 
muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, intellectual 
disability, emotional illness, drug addiction, and alcoholism. 

Qualified Individual with a Disability: An individual with a disability that:  

1.  Satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of 

the position; and 

2.  Can perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable 

accommodation. 

Reasonable Accommodation:  

1.  Modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified 

applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such qualified applicant 
desires; or 

2.  Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or 

circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that 
enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions 
of that position; or 

3.  Modifications or adjustments that enable an employee with a disability to enjoy equal 
benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated 
FEMA employees without disabilities. 

Reassignment: A form of reasonable accommodation that must be provided to an 
employee, who, because of a disability, can no longer perform the essential functions of the 
position they hold, with or without reasonable accommodation. Reassignment is considered 
the accommodation of “last resort.”  

Selective Placement Program Coordinator: Assists FEMA management, as well as the
