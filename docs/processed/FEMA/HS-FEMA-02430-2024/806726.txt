Part E - Executive Summary
 

Introduction 

This Equal Employment Opportunity Program Status Report for Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14) outlines the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Equal Employment Opportunity Program activities, as required by the 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) Management Directive 715. This report highlights 
DHS’s accomplishments in establishing and maintaining a model program by promoting equal employment 
opportunity and identifying areas for improvement for all of its employees and applicants.  The report also 
provides the FY15 plan to address any programmatic deficiencies.  In addition to this Departmental Management 
Directive 715 report, each DHS Component submits its own report to the EEOC.  Directorates and headquarters 
programs reports are accumulated and included in this report. 

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security 

DHS’s mission is to make the nation safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards, where the 
American way of life can thrive.  DHS’s mission is comprised of five major areas of responsibility: 1) Preventing 
Terrorism and Enhancing Security; 2) Securing and Managing Our Borders; 3) Enforcing and Administering Our 
Immigration Laws; 4) Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace; and 5) Ensuring Resilience to Disasters.  In 
addition, DHS specifically focuses on maturing the homeland security enterprise.  Over its eleven years, DHS has 
coordinated the transition of multiple agencies and programs into a single, integrated agency focused on 
protecting the American people and the homeland. 

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties 

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) supports the Department’s mission to secure the nation 
while preserving individual liberty, fairness, and equality under the law.  CRCL is responsible for overseeing the 
integration of civil rights and civil liberties into all of the Department’s activities.  CRCL accomplishes this by: 
directing, overseeing, and coordinating activities for the protection and promotion of civil rights and civil liberties 
for members of the public; advising Department leadership and state and local partners of ways to promote 
respect for civil rights and civil liberties in policy creation and implementation; informing individuals and 
communities whose civil rights and civil liberties may be affected by DHS policies and activities; promoting 
appropriate attention within the Department to concerns and experiences of these individuals or communities; 
investigating and resolving civil rights and civil liberties complaints filed by the public regarding Department 
policies or activities, or actions taken by Department personnel; and leading the Department’s equal employment 
opportunity programs and promoting workforce diversity and merit system principles.  CRCL’s Equal 
Employment Opportunity and Diversity Division includes the following organizational units:  DHS-Headquarters 
Equal Employment Opportunity Office (DHS HQ Equal Employment Opportunity); Diversity Management 
Section; and Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints Management Adjudication Section.  Another part of 
CRCL, the Programs and Compliance Division, falls outside the scope of the Management Directive 715.

Program Elements 

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL 
EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 

In Management Directive 715, six elements serve as the foundation for a model equal employment opportunity 
program: 
•	  Demonstrated commitment from agency leadership; 

•	 

Integration of equal employment opportunity into the agency’s strategic mission; 

•	  Management and program accountability; 

•	  Proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination; 

•	  Efficiency; and 

•	  Responsiveness and legal compliance. 

Essential Element A – Demonstrated Commitment from Agency Leadership 

•	 

In the spring of 2014, the Deputy Secretary established the Employee Engagement Steering Committee, a 

representative body of employees from across the Department to address the issues of greatest importance to 

DHS employees. 

•	  Megan H. Mack, Officer, CRCL, continues to represent DHS on the White House Council on Women and 

Girls.  The Council on Women and Girls includes two subgroups: Science, Technology, Engineering, and 

Mathematics (STEM); and Women Veterans.   

•	  Due to both the volume and significance of law enforcement positions within the Department, the CRCL 

Diversity Management Section coordinated a Department-wide study on Women in Law Enforcement that 

will be completed with findings and associated recommendations during FY15.  Focus groups were 

conducted during FY14, soliciting direct feedback from women in a variety of law enforcement occupations 

throughout five DHS Components.  The study will offer benchmarks from other federal law enforcement 

agencies, identify perceived barriers to EEO and diversity, and provide recommendations and strategies to 

achieve a model workplace that values diversity and provides equality of opportunity. 

•	  TSA’s Deputy Supervisory Federal Air Marshal in Charge from its Washington Field Office was appointed as 

the National President of Women in Federal Law Enforcement (WIFLE). 

•	 

In early FY14, CRCL’s Diversity Management Section conducted two remaining Component site visits on 

FY12 Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Reports, one with the Federal Emergency Management 

Agency (FEMA) and the second with DHS Headquarters (DHS HQ).  The Component site visits were a 

follow-up to a briefing on Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Reports that focused on DHS trends. 

Essential Element B – Integration of EEO into the Agency’s Strategic Mission 

•	  DHS continues implementing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Workforce Strategy, Fiscal Years 

2011-2016, signed by the (former) DHS Secretary on December 21, 2010.  It sets specific goals, objectives,

and performance measures to ensure that DHS attracts, develops, and retains a talented and diverse workforce 

to secure America.  

• 	 

In 2014, OPM launched a new training program, fulfilling a requirement under Executive Order 13548 to 

provide comprehensive training on disability employment.  Modeled after the DHS CRCL’s Employment of 

People with Disabilities: A Roadmap to Success, the OPM online course explores the recruitment, 

interviewing, providing reasonable accommodations, and hiring of individuals with disabilities. Both courses 

are available on the DHS learning management system.  CRCL’s course is also available to the public at: 

http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/training/xus/crcl/employmentdisabilities/Employment_Disabilities/index. 

htm. OPM’s new mandatory program is available at  A Roadmap to Success: Hiring, Retaining and Including 

People with Disabilities. The OPM course is mandatory for all employees that recommend, initiate, take, or 

approve any personnel actions. Employees are required to complete this course every other year. 

• 	  DHS continues to implement the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Diversity and Inclusion Plan, Fiscal 

Years 2012-2015.  The Plan sets specific goals, objectives, and performance measures, which ensure that 

DHS secures a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of society, cultivates a culture that 

encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness, and institutionalizes diversity and inclusion as a key 

strategic priority across all of DHS’ programs.  

•	  During FY14, CRCL continued its participation in recurring high-level strategic activities, including: The 

Secretary’s Bi-Weekly Component Heads’ meetings; DHS Management Council meetings (chaired by the 

Under Secretary for Management and composed of all DHS Component management heads); Human Capital 

Leadership meetings (chaired by the Chief Human Capital Officer and composed of all DHS Component 

Human Resources Directors); and the Workforce Planning Council, which shapes the workforce planning and 

workforce measurement programs for the Department. In FY14, the DHS Equal Employment Opportunity 

and Diversity Council led by CRCL commenced development of an Equal Employment Opportunity Council 

Strategic Plan.  The Plan will articulate both a strategic vision for the Equal Employment Opportunity 

Council and the tactics necessary to carry out that vision.  In FY14, two strategic planning sessions were held. 

The Plan will be finalized during FY15. 

Essential Element C – Management and Program Accountability 

•	  CRCL provided training on reasonable accommodations and employment of Individuals with Disabilities and 

Targeted Disabilities through periodic meetings of the Disability Employment & Accessibility Council.  This 

council is comprised of DHS Component disability program and reasonable accommodations program 

managers.  

•	  CRCL continues to collaborate with OCHCO on many initiatives and programs, including the strategic goals 

identified in the Human Capital Operational Plan and the Diversity and Inclusion Plan.

•	  CRCL conducted two technical assistance and training sessions at FEMA and HQ. 

•	  CRCL provided training on how to better collaborate with Tribal Colleges and Universities through periodic 

meetings of the DHS Tribal Colleges and Universities Program Council. This Council is comprised of DHS 

Component Tribal Colleges and Universities Program Managers.  

•	  The DHS Corporate Recruitment Council developed the Coordinated Recruiting and Outreach Strategy FY 

12-17 to increase outreach to diverse groups and enhance efficiencies in recruiting across the department.  As 

a result, the Corporate Recruitment Council:  

o   Developed  a Top 25 list of recruiting and outreach events targeting diverse populations and 

events focused on law enforcement, DHS’s largest mission critical occupation; 

o	  Established national and regional recruitment initiatives to increase the effectiveness of cross-

functional recruiting activities.  Specifically, the Corporate Recruitment Council coordinated a 

DHS presence at eight recruiting events focused on law enforcement, women, and diverse 

populations:  WIFLE; National Asian Peace Officers Association (NAPOA); National 

Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE); National Native American Law 

Enforcement Association (NNALEA); Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBC); League 

of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC); Hispanic Associations of Colleges and Universities 

(HACU); Hispanic American Police Command Officer Association (HAPCOA); 

o	  Revised Component Recruitment and Outreach Plans (CROP) to enhance recruiting efforts to 

meet current and long-term needs. The CROP is used to assess and evaluate components outreach 

efforts to underrepresented groups with a focus on mission-critical occupations. Components 

completed the revised templates for FY14 to include long-term staffing gap projections and 

planned strategies to fill those gaps. This process required Component recruiters to collaborate 

with workforce planners to identify staffing gaps for two out-years.  The FY15 CROPs were 

issued to components and are scheduled to be finalized and evaluated in preparation for the new 

fiscal year. Additionally, an Accountability Checklist was developed and implemented to assess 

the CROP submissions for accuracy and completion; and 

o	  Reformatted the DHS Recruiter Training to reduce costs and enhance collaboration into a virtual 

format and piloted via webcast to three locations; the Pacific Northwest, the Southern Border, and 

Southeast area.  This training enabled DHS to send local recruiters with general knowledge about 

employment opportunities in all nine DHS components to recruit across the department. 

•	  Overall results of FY14 exit survey indicated the following top three reasons employees separated:  personal 

or family related, advancement opportunities, supervisor/management.  Similar to prior years, respondents

were most dissatisfied with their second level managers, attributed to lack of management skills and poor 

communications. 

Essential Element D – Proactive Prevention 

•	  DHS continues to conduct an annual self-assessment to monitor progress, identify areas where barriers may 

operate to exclude racial, national origin, gender groups, or qualified Individuals with Disabilities, and to 

develop strategic plans to mitigate or eliminate these identified barriers. 

•	  CRCL provided diversity training to employees within the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer.  The 

training examined diversity and inclusion within the DHS culture, addressed unconscious bias, and explored 

workforce generational differences.   In addition, CRCL provided anti-harassment training to staff from the 

Office for Bombing Prevention, National Protection and Programs Directorate.  CRCL also provided two 

anti-harassment training sessions to the Miami and Atlanta offices of the Federal Protective Services.  CRCL 

trained Equal Employment Opportunity staff from ICE on the Acceptance/Dismissal Process, with an 

emphasis on hostile work environment claims.  

•	  CRCL’s Complaints Management and Adjudication Section (CMAS): 

o	  Led a number of collaborative initiatives in FY14 and continued to strengthen partnerships 

between CRCL and other DHS Components.  Several CMAS employees were recruited to serve 

in a newly formed EEOD training cadre and conducted EEO anti-harassment and diversity 

training for managers, supervisors, and non-supervisory employees within DHS Headquarters. 

This training was often provided at the invitation of DHS Headquarters Component heads and 

was instrumental in increasing awareness of EEO laws, individuals’ rights, and managers’ 

responsibilities to maintain a workplace free from discriminatory actions and conduct;  

o	  Refined and issued guidance to EEO offices at all DHS Components regarding best practices for 

conducting effective EEO investigations; 

o	  Led Component EEO Complaint Managers quarterly meetings during which Department-wide 

guidance was shared, training on iComplaints—the enterprise EEO database and document 

management system—was offered, and best practices were identified, and; 

o	  Hosted iComplaints user update trainings for EEO personnel across the Department. These 

sessions created an opportunity for Component personnel to enhance their knowledge and 

effective use of this comprehensive tracking and reporting system. Participants also received 

individualized coaching from the DHS database administrator and Senior Complaints Manager, 

resulting in more accurate data input and also enabling Component personnel to better utilize the 

system’s advanced reporting features.

EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 

•	  DHS Components provided training on disability awareness, hiring, and reasonable accommodation to 7,072 

DHS managers and Supervisors, a decline from 10,371 trained in FY13.  

•	  DHS provided 2,981 reasonable accommodations to applicants, employees, and contractors department-wide 

in FY14.  DHS Components granted 2, 200 or 73.8%, denied 119 or 4%, and categorized 666 or 22.3%  as 

“other”, i.e., closed, remanded, pending, no assistance required, and withdrawn.  This is lower than the 

reported 3,295 in FY13 due to a change in counting convention within FEMA’s accommodation case 

management system.  Of the total accommodations provided in FY14, TSA’s 810 and USCIS’s 1,149 

accounted for 69.0% of all DHS accommodations.  

•	  DHS hired one permanent employee and 13 temporary employees from the Workforce Recruitment Program 

for College Students with Disabilities. Of note, four of the 13 students hired in FY14 were from the prior 

year’s Workforce Recruitment Program database. The Workforce Recruitment Program database is available 

on-line at www.wrp.gov for federal agencies to recruit qualified students with disabilities into either 

temporary or permanent positions. 

•	 

In FY14, using Schedule A Hiring Authority under 5 CFR 213.3102, DHS hired 56 Individuals with 

Disabilities Department-wide, an increase from 55 in FY13, yet below the 100 Schedule A hires made in 

FY12.  

•	  Since June 30, 2003, when DHS became a U.S. Department of Defense, Computer/Electronic 

Accommodation Program Partner, to FY13, DHS received 2,870 accommodation solutions from the 

Computer/Electronic Accommodation Program, saving DHS $1,292,280.  During FY13, DHS experienced a 

25% increase in the number of accommodation solutions from the program.  DHS employees received 432 

accommodation solutions from the program, saving DHS $165,238. [2] 

Essential Element E - Efficiency  

•	  DHS timely submitted the annual Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Statistical Report of 

Discrimination Complaints (EEOC Form 462) to EEOC (see more details in Element F, below) and the 

Annual Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (NO FEAR) 

Report to Congress and others. 

•	  The Complaints Management and Adjudication Section (CMAS) developed and deployed an initiative to 

benchmark Component investigations and identify best practices for conducting effective equal employment 

opportunity investigations.  As a result, CMAS refined and issued guidance to EEO offices at all DHS 

Components regarding best practices for conducting effective EEO investigations. 

•	  The CMAS remained active in FY14 by leading the Component Complaint Managers in quarterly meetings, 

during which Department-wide guidance was shared.  Training on iComplaints was offered, and best 

practices were identified.  The Complaints Management and Adjudication Section hosted two iComplaints

(EEO database) user update trainings for EEO personnel across the Department.  These sessions created an 

opportunity for Component personnel to enhance their knowledge and effective use of this comprehensive 

tracking and reporting system and to receive individualized coaching from the DHS database administrator 

and Senior Complaints Manager, resulting in more accurate data input and also enabling Component 

personnel to better utilize the system’s advanced reporting features. 

•	  During FY14, CRCL continued to collaborate with the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) 

and the Components to address skill gaps that were identified in an OPM report concerning the competencies 

of DHS employees who work in the 0260 occupational series.  CRCL conducted a root cause analysis to 

determine why the gaps exist and developed an operational plan to address the skill of critical thinking.  

•	 

In FY14, DHS completed 940 Equal Employment Opportunity investigations, an increase from 871 in FY13. 

The percentage of timely investigated complaints remained steady at 70% in FY14 and FY13. 

•	  With respect to adjudication, in FY14, the overall percentage of timely merit Final Agency Decision (FAD) 

issuances increased between FY13 (41 percent) and FY14 (53 percent), while overall numbers dropped both 

in terms of total FADs issued and total FADs timely issued when comparing those two years.  Interestingly, 

during FY14, CRCL received only 377 requests for merit FAD (301 issued), compared with 512 incoming 

requests during FY13 (455 issued).  CRCL has no direct control over the number of cases received because 

this is determined by the volume of complaint filings across the Department in the fiscal year along with 

Complainants’ decisions to elect agency merit FADs.  CRCL routinely monitors formal complaint activity 

and anticipates the likely influx of merit FAD requests. 

•	  CRCL received comments and concurrence from Components on a white paper that is expected to lead to the 

implementation of a DHS-wide Alternative Dispute Resolution program.  The white paper will be presented 

to the Deputy Secretary in FY15.  The proposal includes hiring a program manager at the Headquarters level, 

who will be responsible for promoting the program and managing a cadre of internal mediators.  The program 

is expected to result in a decrease in formal filings of Equal Employment Opportunity complaints.  In FY14, 

CRCL received authorization to hire an ADR Program Manager and expects to make a hire in FY15. 

Essential Element F - Responsiveness and Legal Compliance 

DHS’s goal is full compliance with equal employment opportunity statutes, regulations, policy guidance, and 
other written instructions.  Agency personnel are accountable for timely compliance with orders issued by EEOC 
Administrative Judges, and it has implemented procedures in place to ensure timely completion of ordered 
corrective actions and timely submission of compliance reports.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act 

The Office of Accessible Systems & Technologies (OAST) implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, as amended.  Accomplishments during FY14 included:  

•	  Processed 2,108 DHS Accessibility Helpdesk requests across DHS and several federal agencies and public 

entities using its Accessibility Compliance Management System a Web-based program to track accessibility 

related assistance. 

•	  Remediated 28,878 pages (632 document files) of content consisting of forms, policy documents, newsletters, 

Frequently Asked Questions, memoranda, schedules, budget files, handbooks, flyers, schedules, and reports 

across DHS and its Components.  The Accessibility Helpdesk serves as a single point of contact for all 

electronic and information technology accessibility and accommodation needs. 

•	  Completed the final phase of deployment of the online trusted tester training course.  Federal Acquisition 

Certification (FAC) 049 was adopted as the federal-wide introductory course for Section 508 compliance and 

is open to all federal employees.  The course is also included as a continuing learning model for Federal 

Acquisition Certification of Contracting Officer’s Representatives (CORs).  

•	  Trained 1,542 personnel across DHS and its Components and other government agencies through the Section 

508 Awareness Training Program. To date, the Office has graduated 229 testers through the DHS Trusted 

Tester Certification Program. 

•	  Performed Section 508 compliance reviews for four change control boards and for major information 

technology procurements.  Total reviews performed exceeded 5,184 and modifications made as a result of 

Office of Accessible Systems & Technology governance totaled 177. 

•	  Conducted 52 initial accessibility reviews for IT programs on the DHS Major Acquisition Oversight List 

(MAOL).  These reviews allowed the Accessibility Compliance Center of Excellence (ACCOE) to introduce 

Section 508 accessibility standards and proven best practices as well as successfully inventoried 89 of 90 IT 

programs to determine their accessibility status and needs. 

•	  Tested 114 IT and web-based applications that were submitted through the DHS Accessibility Helpdesk. 

•	  Processed 85 reasonable accommodation requests. These requests were for technology- related 

accommodations only.  HQ - EEO Disability Program Manager processed all other accommodation requests. 

•	  Began the internal pilot of a draft mobile test process for IOS and Android.

Workforce Profile and Trend Analysis 

With 179,256 permanent civilian employees, DHS is the third-largest Executive Branch agency.  The total 
permanent workforce decreased by 4,404 employees, or 2.4%, during FY14.  

The DHS workforce trend analysis discussed below was conducted on the permanent employee workforce, as this 
is the only segment that can be meaningfully tracked over time.  Temporary employees are hired for temporary 
needs, their separation is pre-destined, and their makeup can change significantly from year to year, which makes 
discussing temporary trends in Ethnicity/Race Indicator, Sex, and disability less relevant to our analysis of 
employees as they move through the human capital lifecycle.  

Interpreting the tables below is done with parity, as the idealized outcome.  In a world of parity, all groups are 
expected to move through the human capital lifecycle in proportion to their size.  In the tables below, parity would 
result if each row in the table contained essentially the same number all the way across the board.  For example, if 
Black males are 7.2% of the permanent DHS workforce in FY14, they should be 7.2% of each of the following: 
attrition, promotions, low pay grades, middle pay grades, and high pay grades.  If this is not occurring, it 
constitutes a trigger and is suggestive of a possible equal employment barrier.  Multiple years of data are provided 
to give a glimpse into the trends for each particular group.  Successful human capital strategies can minimally 
affect the workforce in a particular year.  Therefore, analysis of several years of data is often useful in these types 
of assessments. 

Additionally, both National Civilian Labor Force and Relevant Civilian Labor Force statistics are provided as 
benchmarks.  The National Civilian Labor Force consists of all persons over 16 years of age, who are not 
institutionalized or on active duty in the armed forces, and who either have a job or want a job.   The Relevant 
Civilian Labor Force is a weighted average of demographic statistics pertaining only to occupations seen within 
DHS.

The workforce participation rate of Black males has been relatively stable over the past seven Fiscal Years, and 
remains well above the participation rate seen in the National Civilian Labor Force. 

Although Black males are increasing their presence in higher grade levels over time, the lower than expected 
promotion rate suggests a possible barrier to upward mobility for this group.

The workforce participation rate of Black females has been relatively stable over the past seven Fiscal Years, and 
remains well above the participation rate seen in the National Civilian Labor Force. 

While Black Females are being hired at a rate that is higher than their onboard workforce participation rate, they 
are separating at a higher than expected rate as well.  This is the case for each year in the time period provided.

The workforce participation rate for Hispanic males is significantly above the rate seen in the National Civilian 
Labor Force. 

This is largely due to DHS’s law enforcement presence in southern border states.  Hispanics constitute 30% of 
CBP Officers, almost half of Border Patrol Agents, and a quarter of Immigration Enforcement Agents.  CBP 
Officers and Border Patrol Agents are required to be fluent in Spanish for initial placements along the southern 
border, Florida, and in Puerto Rico, a requirement that is not present in the standard relevant civilian labor force 
comparison.  This job requirement greatly increases Hispanic representation in these occupations. 

The hiring of Hispanic males has fallen off in recent years, largely due to recent hires being concentrated in the 
Washington, D.C. area, while hires on the southern border have declined.  The attrition rate continues to remain 
well below the workforce representation rate. 

Hispanic males’ promotion rates began to fall into balance with their workforce representation rate after years of 
disproportionately high promotions, and movement from the GS 10-12 grades into the GS 13-15 grades is 
occurring.  For example, as the above chart indicates, in FY14, Hispanic males comprised 11.4% of grades 13-15,  
much higher than in FY07, when Hispanic males comprised 14.4% of the permanent workforce, yet only 7.9% 
were in grades 13-15.

The workforce participation rate for Hispanic females is slightly above the rate in the National Civilian Labor 
Force. 

The workforce participation rate has increased in each of the last seven fiscal years as hires tended to outpace 
attrition, although attrition has increased in FY14.  Hispanic females are being promoted at a rate that is at or 
above what would be expected given their workforce participation rate. 

Hispanic females are significantly overrepresented at the lowest grade levels.  For instance, almost 40% of 
Hispanic Females are in pay bands that are at the GS-8 equivalent level or lower. 

Representation at the highest grade levels has, however, been trending towards parity over the past four years.

EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 

Asian males are represented in the DHS permanent workforce at a rate well above that seen in the National 
Civilian Labor Force.  Their workforce participation rate has increased over the past seven fiscal years, which is 
due to lower than expected attrition rates. 

Asian males have been promoted at rates consistent with their workforce size, are most concentrated in the middle 
pay levels, and their presence at the GS 13-15 levels has been increasing in recent years. 

Nearly 50% of all Asian males are either in the Transportation Security Officers position at TSA or the CBP 
Officer position at CBP.

Asian females comprise the only major minority group whose onboard participation rate is lower than the 
National Civilian Labor Force.  Its participation rate continues to slowly increase. 

Hiring rates in FY13 and FY14, which have exceeded attrition rates, are responsible for the gradual increase in 
Asian female representation over time. 

Asian females are being promoted at rates roughly consistent with their workforce size, and they are spread fairly 
proportionately throughout the GS pay grades.  Their executive representation, while still low, has doubled since 
FY07.

Native American males have approximately the same workforce participation rate as that seen in the National 
Civilian Labor Force.  

Hires, attrition, and promotions for Native American males vary in ways that are not statistically significant, 
which is to be expected when dealing with such a small population. 

Native American males are spread roughly, as expected, throughout the middle range of pay grades, and are 
underrepresented at the extremes. 

Caution should be used when drawing inferences from the data, due to the extremely small size of the population, 
which can produce large swings, may not be statistically significant.

Native American females have a lower workforce representation rate than that seen in the National Civilian Labor 
Force.  Their attrition rate is higher than expected, given their workforce representation rate. 

Native American females are disproportionately concentrated at lower pay levels.  This, along with lower-than-
expected promotion rates, could indicate a lack of upward mobility and explain the higher-than-expected 
separation rate.  Caution should be used when drawing inferences from the data, due to the extremely small size 
of the population, which can produce large swings that may not be statistically significant.

As of FY13, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander males have three times the representation seen in the National 
Civilian Labor Force.  The recent increase in representation is due to hiring; additionally, the attrition rate has 
remained relatively low in most fiscal years. 

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander males are overrepresented in the lowest pay grades and the Executive grades 
promotion rates fluctuate, which is common with very small populations. 

Caution should be used when drawing inferences from the data, due to the extremely small size of the population, 
which can produce large swings that may not be statistically significant.

Currently, the White male representation rate at DHS has been declining consistently across time, slightly 
exceeding that seen in the National Civilian Labor Force, and is below the Relevant Civilian Labor Force.  The 
hiring, attrition, and promotion rates are roughly in-line with the overall workforce representation rate and are not 
otherwise remarkable. 

White males are overly concentrated at higher pay levels and under-concentrated at lower pay levels.  However, 
efforts to enhance recruiting of a diverse population have reduced the pay grade disparity for White males.  It is 
also true that as White males retire, it is common for their replacement to come from a more diverse feeder pool.

EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 

The White females’ participation rate is significantly less at DHS, relative to the rate in the National Civilian 
Labor Force.  The representation of White females decreased as a percentage of the overall workforce for the past 
six years, due to a higher-than-expected attrition rate, which reached an all-time high in FY13.  FY14 marks the 
first year that White females’ promotion rate is not below their participation rate.  Lower-than-expected 
promotion rates could reflect a possible barrier to upward mobility. 

White females tend to be concentrated at both ends of the pay spectrum, with few White females in the middle GS 
10-12 grades.  Their concentration is highest at the Executive/Senior Leader pay grades.

The percentage of the DHS workforce that self-identifies as having a disability is lower than the average seen in 
the entire federal workforce.  Within non-Law Enforcement positions, the percentage of the workforce with a 
disability goes up by roughly one full percentage point, but this is still below the federal average of 8.6%. 

Employees with disabilities separated at higher rates than their workforce representation rate—common 
throughout both federal and private sectors. 

Promotion rates in each of the past six years were lower than expected given the size of the onboard disabled 
workforce.  Employees with disabilities are fairly evenly dispersed across the pay grade levels.

The percentage of the DHS workforce that self-identifies as having a targeted disability1
seen in the entire Federal workforce.  Within non-Law Enforcement positions, the percentage of workers with 
targeted disabilities increases by roughly a tenth of a percentage point.  This is still less than the 1.02% across the 
federal government, and well below the federal government goal of 2%.  

 is lower than the average 

High rates of separation, concentration at lower pay levels, and low rates of promotions characterize this 
population.  In FY14, a resurvey of the workforce was conducted at the U.S. Coast Guard, during which many 
Coast Guard employees’ status changed to targeted disabled.  This resurvey is responsible for the overall increase 
in the workforce participation rate in FY14. 

The tables above provide a high-level overview of the DHS workforce.  Similar tables were created for the DHS 
Components, each of which received an individually tailored briefing on their workforce and data triggers after 
last year’s reporting season. 

1 Targeted Disabilities, a subset of reportable disabilities, are considered the most severe disabilities. As a matter of policy, 
the federal government has initiated a special emphasis on recruiting, hiring and retaining people with targeted disabilities. 
Categories on OPM’s Standard Form 256 which make up targeted disabilities include: deafness, blindness, missing 
extremities, partial or complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.  See 
http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/reference-materials/sf256.pdf for the form itself.

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL 
EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT 

The Best Places to Work in the Federal Government 

DHS administered the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Survey between 2005 and 2014.  DHS ranked last 
among all large Departments and Agencies in 2013, and the 2014 results were even less positive for DHS than its 
2013 results. 

The overall DHS score is largely driven by TSA and CBP Components, which make up roughly 60 percent of all 
DHS respondents.  There are other DHS Components that show higher employee satisfaction, and it is clear that 
satisfaction within Components can vary greatly depending on occupation, location, job tenure, and other factors.  
Race and gender are not found to be great predictors of satisfaction.  Disability status, however, is a strong 
predictor, with DHS employees with disabilities providing more negative responses to almost all items in the 
survey.  

New Area of Focus – Women in Law Enforcement 

Women occupy approximately 8.4% of Law Enforcement positions at DHS.  This female participation rate is 
substantially less than what is seen in law enforcement positions across the Federal government, and even less 
than that seen in the Civilian Labor Force’s benchmark for criminal investigators.  In the spring of 2014, DHS 
commenced a study to better understand the causes of the low female representation rate within law enforcement 
positions.  A blended approach was used, which incorporated personnel data, focus groups, and one-on-one 
interviews.  The report is expected to be completed for the Secretary of DHS during 2015. 

Data Sources 

The workforce numbers used in this report were generated by the DHS’ new Oracle-based AXIS database, and 
were based on an extraction from the National Finance Center’s data for Pay Period 19, which ended on October 
4, 2014.  DHS employees voluntarily submitted all race, national origin, gender, and disability data relied upon in 
this report.  Statistics on Individuals with Disabilities/Individuals with Targeted Disabilities in the federal 
government were obtained within the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s 2013 Report on the Employment of 
Individuals with Disabilities in the Federal Executive Branch, found at: http://www.Office of Personnel 
Management.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-and-inclusion/reports/disability-report-fy2012.pdf. 

National Civilian Labor Force statistics were compiled using the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 
data.  Relevant Civilian Labor Force statistics were compiled using the American Community Survey data, along 
with the distribution of DHS personnel across occupations. 

Equal Employment Opportunity complaint numbers were obtained via complaint data collected by DHS and its 
Components and stored in iComplaints, the Departmental case management software program.  Equal 
Employment Opportunity Specialists at the DHS Components enter information into the program, and the 
program has the ability to process ad hoc queries for evaluating all aspects of the Equal Employment Opportunity 
case management process.

Personnel Management and made available to CRCL for analysis purposes. 

Conclusion 

DHS is proud of its accomplishments in the areas of attracting, developing, and retaining an increasingly diverse 
workforce.  This report identified several challenges: establishing an effective career development program; 
establishing a retention strategy; correcting substantial low participation rates of White women in the DHS 
workforce; and increasing the participation of Individuals with Disabilities and Individuals with Targeted 
Disabilities.  The plan in Part I addresses these issues.

Activities #1 and 3: 
Through the creation of the DHS Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan in FY12, the Department has planned 
objectives and goals towards promoting the principles of EEO, diversity, and inclusion throughout the 
Components. 

Activity #2: 
x 

The Diversity and Inclusion Sustainability Subcommittee developed a diversity training similar in content to 
the training conducted by Laura Liswood,  Senior Advisor for Goldman Sachs, and author of The Loudest 
Duck: Moving beyond Diversity while Embracing Differences to Achieve Success at Work,  in FY14 and 
incorporated material from OPM’s New IQ training program.  This training will be presented to the remaining 
career senior executives in the National capital Region who did not attend Liswood’s training (20%).  The 
training is expected to be conducted in FY 2015, at which time all career senior executives in the National 
Capital Region would have received diversity and inclusion training.  DHS is currently assessing options to 
train the executives in the field.

Accountability 

Program Deficiency Analysis: 

Objective: 

Brief Description of Program Deficiency  

Specific Deficiencies Identified by Components: 

36-Are regular (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually) Equal 
Employment Opportunity program updates provided to 
management/supervisory officials by Equal Employment 
Opportunity program officials? 

38 – 40  Have time tables or schedules been established for the 
agency to review its Merit Promotion Policy and Procedures, 
Employee Recognition Awards Program and Procedures, Employee 
Development/Training Programs for systematic barriers that may be 
impeding full participation in the program for all groups? 

43-Has the agency, when appropriate, disciplined or sanctioned 
managers/supervisors, or employees found to have discriminated 
over the past two years? 

45-Does the agency review disability accommodation 
decisions/actions to ensure compliance with its written procedures 
and analyze the information tracked for trends, problems, etc.? 

Many standard human resources policies were outdated or had never 
been issued; there was no cost-benefit analysis of recruitment efforts; 
there was no systematic implementation of reasonable 
accommodations; and human resources and Equal Employment 
Opportunity offices were often not coordinating closely.  

Create accountability for all managers, supervisors, and Equal 
Employment Opportunity officials and personnel officers for the 
effective implementation and management of the DHS Equal 
Employment Opportunity program.

A revised management directive on the topic of disability accommodations has been vetted and reviewed by the 
USCIS Director, DHS and EEOC in FY13.  Currently, the revised MD is scheduled to be reviewed with the 
agency’s union in FY15, and will make numerous changes to the USCIS process, including: 

•	  Requires management to contact the Disability Accommodation Program upon receipt of all disability 

accommodation requests, for recordkeeping purposes.  

•	  Extends the agency’s allotted processing time by five (5) business days. 

•	  Decision-maker must consult with Disability Accommodation Program before making determination to 

provide assistive technology or equipment. 

•	  Decision-maker will use a standard form to make an initial request for medical documentation, if such 

information is deemed necessary to make a determination on a request, and if other medical documentation 

was offered in conjunction with the request. 

•	  Following the closure of a request, Disability Accommodation Program will be custodian of medical 

documentation. 

•	  Decisions to approve alternative accommodations must be reviewed by Disability Accommodation Program 

Manager, in addition to denials. 

•	  Time period for making a decision on a request to reconsider a denial is increased to 14 calendar days. 

•	  To obtain compliance with Federal Accessibility Standards, USCG plans to renovate field locations:  Seattle, 

Washington.  Bathroom accessibility renovations were funded in FY14.  The bathroom renovation project 

was awarded in March 2014, with construction completion scheduled for November 2014 (first quarter 

FY15); and Sector Charleston, SC. The project addressing first floor renovations to the MSO Building is 

under construction. The project is scheduled to be completed by FY15 (First quarter). 

•	  FEMA completed its revisions to the Agency’s reasonable accommodation procedures and anticipated a 

release date of December 2014.  This update will include additional process guidance on the use of Service 

Animals, particularly (Emotional Support Animals, Therapy Animals and Comfort Animals), Telework, 

Facility Accessibility and many other Disaster Workforce-related accommodations.   

Activity #4 
•	 

ICE will convene a second meeting to discuss team members’ observations regarding the Awards, Merit 

Promotion and Training Policies, related external barrier analyses, and EEOC barrier analysis checklists. 

•	  On February 14, 2014, ICE identified three policies and programs for review.  On June 24, 2014, 

•	  ODCR drafted the EEO Barrier Identification & Elimination procedural training document to assist the 

Barrier Analysis Workgroup in understanding what barriers are, their causes and how to properly eliminate 

barriers as it pertains to merit promotion, training and development, and awards.

•	  TSA established two barrier analysis assessment teams composed of key agency stakeholders to identify the 

root-cause underlying two triggers:  the under-representation of females (Team A) and individuals with 

targeted disabilities (Team B) in the total workforce.  The two teams conducted a series of focus groups.  

Fourteen airports and Federal Air Marshal Field offices were identified to support development of 

recommendations. 

Activity # 5 
FEMA plans to develop, establish, and implement a process for regular evaluations of Agency awards, and to 
develop a reporting format that links demographic information to award recipients.  A new awards policy will be 
implemented across FEMA effective January 2015.  FEMA’s Office of Equal Rights reviews and evaluates 
Agency awards during each award review period.  A report is sent directly to EEO from OCCHCO that details the 
information. 

Activity #6 
•	 

ICE allocated funds to the EEO Program to ensure agency self-assessments and self-analyses per MD 715 are 

conducted annually and to maintain an effective complaint processing system.  To this end, ICE will hire 

three full-time positions and seek funding for a fourth position to achieve full operational capability.  ICE is 

currently in the process of reviewing resumes and conducting interviews. 

•	 

ICE’s newly established Barrier Analysis Workgroup will review the Merit Promotion Program Policy and 

Procedures for barriers during the second and fourth quarters of every fiscal year.  In FY15, ICE will conduct 

the first meeting of the barrier analysis workgroup and assign related tasks. 

•	 

In FY14, USCIS completed the following activities:

o   The Subcommittee’s initial briefing to the Chiefs of the Office of Equal Opportunity & 

Inclusion/Human Capital & Training (HCT) was held on April 3, 2014. During the briefing, the 

Chiefs requested some additional analysis. The Subcommittee’s final results and 

recommendations, incorporating the additional analysis and revising the comparator of the CLF 

to the Federal Workforce were provided on September 17, 2014. 

Activity #9 
•	  Coordination and data collection for the USCIS Professional Development Program (PDP) was initiated in 

September 2014 as a first step in reviewing USCIS’s Employee and Development/Training Programs.  On 

September 29, 2014, direct access to the PDP reporting system was acquired by OEOI. Efforts are underway 

to review FY14 participation and the current policy for possible systemic barriers.  HCT collects SF-181 

forms on a voluntary basis from all PDP applicants, and will forward all forms to OEOI beginning in FY15 as 

required by USCIS policy.  The Awards/Recognition Subcommittee is scheduled to meet for the first time in 

November 2015. 

•	  USCIS also plans in FY15 to: 

o	  Develop and implement a plan that will ensure senior managers are involved in the barrier 

identification and elimination process. 

o	  As barriers are identified, solicit input and feedback from senior leadership on the means to 

eliminate barriers and enlist their support in implementing plans devised to address these 

impediments to equality of opportunity. 

•	  USCIS completed plans to distribute MD-715 report to senior leadership and encourage them to submit 

suggestions and ideas for identifying and eliminating possible barriers for triggers identified in the report. 

•	  USCIS also delivered the state of EEO briefing to senior leaders and solicit their input into barrier 

identification and enlist their assistance in identifying other triggers of which they may be aware. 

•	  As a first step towards developing and implementing a plan to involve senior managers in the barrier 

identification and elimination process, USCIS developed a standardized demographic snapshot report 

template (Diversity Dashboard) that was approved by the Chief, Office for Equal Opportunity and Inclusion 

in August 2014.  OEOI also hired a full time Management and Program Analyst effective September 22,

closely involve them in the barrier identification and elimination process. 

• 	  On April 2, 2014, the FY13 MD-715 report was distributed to all USCIS managers via a Leadership Guidance 

message.  Additionally, on April 4, 2014, the report was distributed to all USCIS employees via the USCIS 

Today publication and posted on OEOI’s intranet site which is accessible to all employees. 

•	  Due to the OEOI/HCT Cross-functional Team’s Merit Promotion Program Subcommittee’s efforts, USCIS 

developed the ability to obtain merit promotion selection data by ERI/G using both the internal human 

resources system and NFC systems effective March 31, 2014.  Efforts to capture career development data by 

ERI/G are ongoing. 

• 	  As a result of the Deputy Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas’ initiative “The Department You Deserve,” HCT 

was tasked with providing DHS OCHCO with summaries of USCIS’s hiring transparency 

activities/accomplishments.  The weekly report provides a status of completed and planned activities related 

to the hiring and promotion process, which is one of the five areas of focus.  HCT anticipates future tasking 

on the remaining four focus areas (Training and Professional Development, Rewards and Recognition, 

Performance Management, and Communication).  The weekly reports are prepared in partnership with OEOI 

and other stakeholders. 

• 	 

In direct support of the QWI’s Hiring Transparency goal, HCT has developed a SharePoint database to track 

all efforts relative to hiring and promotion.  In addition to the Hiring Transparency database, HCT reports and 

coordinates recruitment efforts to support the DHS Coordinated Recruiting and Outreach Strategy. 

•	  At USSS, The Secret Service Uniformed Division, Office of the Chief, conducts a 2-day 

leadership/management training session for all new first-line supervisors.  Representatives from the Secret 

Service EEOD explain to new Uniformed Division Officer supervisors their roles and responsibilities for 

successful EEO program implementation. The new Uniformed Division Officer supervisors also get an 

introduction to resolving workplace conflicts, providing reasonable accommodations, participating in 

community outreach, recruitment activities, and participating in diversity initiatives. 

•	  The USSS Office of Professional Responsibility, Inspection Division, regularly conducts office inspections 

and EEOD provides information for inclusion in the resulting compliance inspection reports.

REPORT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS and MODIFICATIONS TO OBJECTIVE 

Activity #1: 
DHS is preparing to assemble a selection panel to select a Department-wide Enterprise Talent Management 
System.  Once this system is operational, a Department-wide automated system will be available to capture 
employee participation in career development programs.  Participation in specific programs can currently be 
reviewed manually at each DHS Component, but there is no mechanism in place to aggregate the results. 

Activities #2 & 3: 
DHS coordinated with Components to revise the Equal Employment Opportunity complaint processing 
procedures.  This coordination effort allowed DHS and Components to review and revise procedures regarding 
Equal Employment Opportunity investigations focusing on the timeliness of conducting investigations, reviewing 
and issuing equal employment opportunity reports of investigations.  The revised complaint procedures were 
issued in October 2012.  

Activity  #4: 
In FY14, DHS CRCL initiated the creation of a Department-wide Special Emphasis Program framework, which 
includes several Components that will directly aid in the broad completion of barrier analyses across the 
Components. To facilitate this, additional staff was authorized and hired within CRCL.  Full implementation is 
expected in FY15.

Activity # 6: 
CBP will complete development of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) training module which emphasizes 
the Federal government’s interest in encouraging mutual resolution of disputes and the benefits associated with 
ADR. 

USCG surpassed the EEOC recommended ADR pre-complaint resolution rate of 34 percent, achieving a 41 
percent rate. 

The USSS has an ADR program; however, the program is underutilized in the EEO Complaint Process. The 
Agency’s Pre-complaint ADR program participation continues to be far below EEOC’s target participation rate of 
50 percent.   To address this deficiency, the USSS will: 

1. Continue to encourage participation in the ADR program by Secret Service employees,  
2. Develop an ADR informational handout to be presented to the complainant during the intake process, and, 
3. Design an ADR poster and place in the headquarters building and field offices.

FEDERAL AGENCY ANNUAL   
EEO PROGRAM STATUS REPORT  

Part I: EEO Plans To Eliminate Identified Barriers
 

Part I-1: Underrepresentation 

STATEMENT OF CONDITION THAT 
WAS A TRIGGER FOR A POTENTIAL 
BARRIER: 
Provide a brief narrative describing the 
condition at issue. 

How was the condition recognized as a 
potential barrier? 

Women and several ethnic and racial groups have low participation rates in the 
overall workforce, and low hiring rates for certain major occupations, when 
compared to the Relevant Civilian Labor Force. 

A review of workforce data indicates various groups are below the Relevant 
Civilian Labor Force percentage, and the Federal average and DHS hiring goals, 
respectively. 

BARRIER ANALYSIS: 
Provide a description of the steps taken 
and data analyzed to determine cause 
of the condition. 

Workforce data are analyzed at the DHS level, at the Component level, and by  
major occupations.  Applicant flow data became available for all DHS Components  
in FY14, and is also being  used to assess the cause of the observed disparities.  

STATEMENT OF IDENTIFIED 
BARRIER: 
Provide a succinct statement of the 
agency policy, procedure or practice 
that has been determined to be the 
barrier of the undesired condition. 

Representation is driven by past hires, current recruitment, current staffing, 
retirement, and resignations.  

It appears that many of the racial disparities between the DHS workforce and the 
National Civilian Labor Force or National Relevant Civilian Labor Force are due to 
the geographic location of the jobs. 

The gender disparity has not yet been fully identified, although a study on Women 
in Law Enforcement positions at DHS was conducted in FY14, which has provided 
some insight into why DHS Law Enforcement positions may differ from Law 
Enforcement positions elsewhere. 

OBJECTIVE:  
State the alternative or revised agency 
policy, procedure or practice to be 
implemented to correct  the undesired 
condition.  

For total workforce participation/new  hires:  
Develop and implement a MD 715 data system and an applicant data tracking  
system; develop needed data tools; analyze data carefully; develop remediation  
plans; and monitor closely.  

For major occupations: 

Increase outreach methods using new media.
 

RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL: 

OCHCO; CRCL; DHS Components 

DATE OBJECTIVE INITIATED: 

February 1, 2011 

TARGET DATE FOR COMPLETION 
OF OBJECTIVE: 

It is anticipated that this Part I will be closed in FY15.  The condition will continue 
to be monitored, and this Part I will be replaced with one that is less general and 
more targeted.

Report of Accomplishments and Modifications to Objective 

Activity #1 
•	  DHS’ Office of the Chief Human Capital Office conducted significant research on the new Inclusion 
Quotient (IQ) research pertaining to the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey questions, providing a 
better understanding of which Components of DHS are lacking in the five habits of inclusion (Fair, Open, 
Cooperative, Supportive, and Empowered). 

•	  CRCL conducted a study on women in law enforcement positions, utilizing personnel data, focus groups, 
and individual interviews to gain a better understanding of the challenges facing women law enforcement 
officers at DHS. 

•	  An analysis of the Department’s permanent workforce and major mission-critical occupations shows 

Blacks and Hispanics, both female and male, are more likely to be clustered in positions that do not have 
a clear career path into the senior pay grades.  Targeted recruiting can be utilized to effectively target 
ethnic and race indicator groups for these feeder positions. 

•	  National Civilian Labor Force and National Relevant Civilian Labor Force percentages were created with 
updated American Community Survey data for the first time in FY13, and updated this year based on the 
FY14 DHS workforce.   

•	  CRCL provided briefings to each DHS Component on their FY13 MD 715 report, providing customized 

advice on what occupational and demographic triggers need the most attention. 

Component-specific accomplishments included: 
CBP: 
•	  Completed an analysis of 

o	  Academy attrition by national origin, race, and sex. 
o	  Participation rates in CBP’s succession management programs by national origin, race, and 

sex. 

o	  Applicant flow data of five major occupations at CBP. 
o	  Workforce grade level distribution by disability, national origin, race, and sex. 
o	  FY11 and FY12 initial applicant pools for two of CBP’s core law enforcement occupations— 
Border Patrol Agent and CBP Officer—indicating that recruitment efforts during these years 
attracted a diverse applicant pool, including those from groups currently underrepresented in 
each occupation. 

FLETC: 
•	  Continued last year’s practice of benchmarking with the proper outside Relevant Civilian Labor Force 
benchmark for their most common occupation (Law Enforcement Instructors in the 1801 job series). 
•	  Continued to monitor the workplace and employee engagement trends through the efforts of the Office of 

Organizational Health (OOH).  The Chief is also a Senior Staff champion of FLETC’s Diversity & 
Inclusion Council.  Quarterly reports are provided to the Senior Executive team on the “State of the

training, development, and awards.
 

TSA: 

TSA established two barrier analysis assessment teams composed of key agency stakeholders to identify the 

root-cause underlying two triggers:  the under-representation of females (Team A) and individuals with 

targeted disabilities (Team B) in the total workforce.  The two teams conducted a series of focus groups.  

Fourteen airports and Federal Air Marshal Field offices were identified to support development of 

recommendations. 


USSS: 

USSS has three Working Groups (Special Agent, Uniformed Division Officers, and Administrative, 

Professional, and Technical) to encourage open dialogue regarding workforce issues and factors that affect
 
employee satisfaction, recruitment, and retention.  These groups explore important issues that impact 

employees and the work environment, develop solutions, and provide valuable input and recommendations to
 
senior management.  Immediate action is taken to address deficiencies in various areas
 

Activities #2, 6-8 
The DHS Corporate Recruitment Council brings together key recruiting personnel across DHS. The Council 
develops a “Top 25” list annually of recruiting and outreach events that target diverse populations and events 
that are focused on law enforcement—our largest mission critical occupation. 

DHS entered memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with associations that represent diverse Higher Education 
Associations including the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), National Association 
for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), American Indian Higher Education Consortium 
(AIHEC), Asian Pacific Islander American Association of Colleges and Universities (APIACU), and 
American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) 

Component-Specific accomplishments included: 
FEMA: 
FEMA met with the National Council of La Raza in August 2014 to identify points of collaboration that will 
increase engagement with the Hispanic/Latino community at the community level.  Discussed ways to 
collaborate and to help emergency managers understand how to engage more with Hispanic/Latino 
communities. 

FLETC: 
•	  FLETC has formally adopted a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Council that incorporates its former 

FLETC Recruitment Council.  The D&I Council’s initiatives focus on ways to meet prescribed workforce 
representation goals and benchmarks.  The Council is co-chaired by the FLETC EEO Officer and the 
Human Capital Officer.  Ongoing collaboration among the FLETC’s Human Capital Division (HCD), the 
EEO Division, and the Council has developed into a viable partnership for participation in numerous 
community outreach activities, career/job fairs, and conferences at colleges and universities throughout 
the reporting year.

•	  FLETC outreach efforts included Minority Serving Institutions, professional organizations, colleges, that 

service students with disabilities, women’s colleges, disability related organizations, and military 
organizations. 

•	  FLETC senior level managers participated in the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement 

Executives (NOBLE) Conference and Exhibition.  FLETC’s involvement was multi-faceted.  The team 
interacted with a host of law enforcement professionals via a conference exhibit, presented the Leadership 
through Understanding Human Behavior training program and participated in NOBLE Education and 
Training Committee activities including coordination of workshops. 

•	  FLETC senior level managers participated in a Women’s History Month Panel Discussion, where the 

event was video teleconferenced to FLETC’s field sites. 

USSS: 
•	  The Office of Human Resources and Training, Recruitment Division (REC) developed and implemented 
a Recruitment and Outreach Plan that outlines strategies to ensure that the Secret Service institutes an 
effective program to build a highly qualified pool of applicants from diverse backgrounds to include 
minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. 

•	  USSS Recruitment Division participated in 310 career fairs and conference (110 colleges and universities, 
12 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 2 Hispanic Serving Institutions, 7 African American 
organizations, 6 Asian Pacific Islander organizations, 21 Diversity organizations, 7 Hispanic 
organizations, 110 Military organizations, 4 Native American organizations, 12 women organizations, 3 
Disability/Veterans organizations and 16 other general organizations). 

•	  The Recruitment Division continued to work closely with the Office of Government and Public Affairs 
and Forensic Division to maintain a website geared towards women who are interested in a career with 
the Secret Service. 

Activity #3 
The department continues to actively implement the DHS Coordinated Recruiting and Outreach Strategy 
(CROS).  The strategy has the dual goals of increasing outreach to diverse groups and enhancing efficiencies 
in recruiting across the department.  The implementation has also focused on greater partnership between 
Component recruiting and workforce planning teams.  Currently, the DHS CROS is being updated to better 
align the goals and objectives with the DHS Human Capital Strategic Plan (FY15-FY19), enhance the 
performance metrics, and incorporate other updates commensurate to the current fiscal environment. The 
CROS continues to assist with meeting the department’s overall recruiting and outreach objectives, which 
include increasing the diversity of applicant pools, reducing duplication of effort, decreasing agency outreach 
and recruiting costs where appropriate, and presenting a unified DHS image. Additionally, data continues to 
be collected through the DHS Recruiting and Outreach Cost Tracker. 

Activity #4 
The summer of 2014 marked the first time that CRCL acquired access to applicant flow data for all DHS 
Components.  This data is available in summary table format (i.e., Table A7), and also in the record level data 
for the DHS Components that are USA Staffing clients.  Preliminary analysis of the applicant flow data 
reflects a diverse applicant pool across most occupations, with diversity diminishing slightly at the selection

phase for certain positions.  Because hiring slowed considerably in the last few years, it will take time for 
enough data to accumulate to allow for strong conclusions to be drawn. 

Activity #5 
This activity is conducted regularly through the Corporate Recruitment Council.  In addition, an Excel 
spreadsheet was developed in FY13 and approved in early FY14 to better track recruiting costs across DHS 
and to assist with assessing recruiting activities.  The data collected will also identify recruiting activities 
across DHS.  

Activity #9 
•	  The DHS Corporate Recruiting Council, comprised of recruiting personnel from DHS Components, 
assists in implementing the Coordinated Recruitment and Outreach Strategy.  In FY14, the Council 
continued to maintain a Top 25 list of recruiting events to attend. Due to budget constraints, focus was 
confined to attending events that targeted DHS mission critical occupations, notably law enforcement.  As 
a result, participation was coordinated across all DHS Components with the following organizations in 
FY14:  Women in Federal Law Enforcement (WIFLE); National Asian Peace Officers Association 
(NAPOA); National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE); National Native 
American Law Enforcement Association (NNALEA); Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBC); 
League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC); Hispanic Associations of Colleges and Universities 
(HACU); Hispanic American Police Command Officer Association (HAPCOA).  Also, the USCG and 
USSS recruited at Society for American Indian Government Employees. 

•	 

In FY14, the Component Recruitment and Outreach Plans (CROP) were revised to enhance recruiting 
efforts to meet current and long-term needs (see Appendix 8).  The CROP is used to assess and evaluate 
Component outreach efforts for groups with low participation rates with a focus on mission-critical 
occupations. Components completed the revised templates for FY14 to include long-term staffing gap 
projections and planned strategies to fill those gaps.  This process required Component recruiters to 
collaborate with workforce planners to identify staffing gaps for two out-years.  The FY15 CROPs were 
issued to Components and are scheduled to be finalized and evaluated in preparation for the new fiscal 
year.  Additionally, an Accountability Checklist was developed and implemented to assess the CROP 
submissions for accuracy and completion.

STATEMENT OF CONDITION THAT  
WAS A TRIGGER FOR  A POTENTIAL 
BARRIER:   
Provide a brief narrative describing the 
condition at issue. 

How was the condition recognized as a 
potential barrier? 

BARRIER ANALYSIS:  
Provide a description of the steps taken 
and data analyzed to determine cause 

of the condition.  

STATEMENT OF IDENTIFIED 
BARRIER: 
Provide a succinct statement of the 
agency policy, procedure or practice 
that has been determined to be the 
barrier of the undesired condition. 

OBJECTIVE:  
State the alternative or revised agency  
policy, procedure or practice to be 
implemented to correct  the undesired 
condition.  

DHS has a permanent workforce representation of Individuals with Disabilities of  
5.4%.  Individuals with Targeted Disabilities are represented at 0.42%,  well below  
the Federal average of 0.88% and the 2% Federal goal.  

Low rate of hires of Individuals with Disabilities and Individuals with Targeted
  
Disabilities.  
 

Note:  This is a multi-year plan  which carries over into future years.
  

Access to a more sophisticated data reporting tool has provided better understanding 
of the causes of low participation for these groups.  While Individuals with 
Disabilities and Individuals with Targeted Disabilities, compared to those without 
disabilities, are both being hired at rates in rough proportion to their workforce 
participation rates, they are separating at much higher rates—as much as 50%  
higher than their workforce participation rate would predict.  As hiring flattens out 
in the face of new budget constraints, this high attrition rate will have more impact 
on Individuals with Disabilities and Individuals with Targeted Disabilities compared 
to those without disabilities at DHS.  Recruiting and retention efforts, therefore, are 
both of increasing importance going forward.

x  As a part of the plan to increase CBP’s Employment of Individuals with Disabilities, all hiring 
managers and human resources professionals are required to take a training module on the 
employment of Individuals with Disabilities. All new CBP supervisors are required to complete “New 
Supervisor Orientation” and “Supervisor Leadership Training” (SLT).  SLT is a foundational course 
for all new CBP supervisors. During the SLT, participants are required to complete a module on EEO 
Awareness. Within the module is a section on the reasonable accommodation process, which includes 
an overview of the resources available through the Computer/Electronics Accommodation Program 
(CAP) and the Job Accommodation Network (JAN).  During FY14, 589 new supervisors completed 
the SLT course. 

x 

In FY14, 800 CBP supervisors completed the web-based training, bringing the total to 5,000 CBP 
supervisors trained since its launch in FY12, nearly half of all 10,485 CBP supervisors onboard. 

x  USCIS, in partnership with the EEOC, continued providing mandatory disability accommodation 
training for managers and supervisors, with more than 2,400 supervisors now having received this 
training since FY11. This training made officially mandatory by the USCIS Director this year, 
through a memorandum. This webinar was extended to employees this year for the first time. 
Training sessions were also conducted on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Schedule A, and Deaf 
Awareness. Almost 700 employees received some type of accommodations training in FY14. 

x 

ICE provided training to 2,436 managers and supervisors on disability accommodation and

Activity #1l-o 

x  DHS maintains strategic partnerships with national disability advocacy groups and provides 

Components with recruitment resources for Individuals with Disabilities/Individuals with Targeted 
Disabilities.  DHS attended recruiting events at Gallaudet University. 

x  USSS sponsored a walking tour of Gallaudet University for USSS employees.  Additionally, DHS 
utilized the Workforce Recruitment Program.  USCG hired two students and USCIS hired six, and 
FLETC hired one, into temporary positions, with one USCIS student hired as a permanent.  CBP 
hired four students from the FY12 database, making it a total of 13 WRP individuals placed by DHS 
in FY14, a substantial improvement over two in FY13.  USCIS developed program guidance for 
supervisors of WRP students.  CRCL and OCHCO will establish goals for WRP.  In reviewing a 
benchmark survey of agencies using WRP successfully, it appears that all have central funding for the 
program.  DHS will explore this vehicle to increase participation in the WRP. 

x  CRCL and OCHCO will continue exploring new forms of outreach for applicants with targeted 

disabilities.  

Activity #1p 

x	  CRCL and OCHCO will provide training for Selective Placement Coordinators, all of whom are

x	  CBP conducted 91 instances of electronic outreach to institutions of higher learning for students 
with disabilities.  In addition, CBP participated in nine onsite career fairs and 13 electronic 
recruitment events targeted towards individuals with disabilities.  Further, CBP participated in 
263 veterans and disabled veterans’ recruitment, information, and outreach events located 
throughout the Nation and abroad. 

Activity #2c 

x  CRCL continued to explore options to implement a single DHS-wide effective tracking mechanism 
for capturing all Component reasonable accommodations.  TSA’s prior Reasonable Accommodation 
Program Manager discussed the new tracking system (built in-house), which is more user-friendly 
than the current one, being piloted in three Components.  In FY14, the new TSA Program Manager 
offered to share this program with the other Components. 

x	  Reasonable Accommodations Program Managers in second quarter FY15.  A decision will then be 
made to implement either TSA’s program, or Accessibility Compliance Management System 
(ACMS). 

x	  DHS provided 2,981 reasonable accommodations to employees, including for the first time 14 

contractors in FY14.  DHS policy prohibits contractors from installing software on our systems. 
Therefore, to accommodate contractors, DHS provides accommodations to the contractors.  Of the 
total number of accommodations provided in FY14, TSA’s 810 and USCIS’s 1,149 accounted for 
66.0% of all DHS accommodations.    

x  Of the requests for reasonable accommodation, DHS Components granted 2,200 or 73.8%, denied 

119 or 4.0 %, and categorized 666 or 22.3% as “other” (i.e., closed, remanded, pending, no assistance 
required, and those withdrawn).  The most common accommodations ergonomic keyboards, telework, 
software programs for low vision, reassignment, and sign language interpreter services provided in 
FY13 were the same as those provided in FY14.  

USCIS: 

x 	  Conducted a five year trend analysis of the hiring, advancement, and retention of Individuals with 

Targeted Disabilities.  

x   Of the 1,125 requests for reasonable accommodation, USCIS  granted 1,107 or 98%.   
x  Spent $1,211,208 on reasonable accommodations using central funding.  In addition to central 

funding, other sources within USCIS included the Office of Training and Career Development, which 
pays for accommodations for employees who participate in their training programs.  Approximately 
$895,269 of the total spent on accommodations went toward providing sign language and other 
services to employees with hearing loss.

x	 

Increased its Disability Accommodations Program staff from three to six,  which include a Program 
Manager, three Equal Employment Opportunity Specialists who advise on accommodation issues, 
one Equal Employment Opportunity Specialist who is responsible for implementing a multi-year plan 
to increase the hiring of individuals with targeted disabilities It also hired a Management and Program 
Analyst, responsible for processing ergonomic accommodation requests using the agency’s central 
fund to make accommodation purchases.  In addition to these six employees, the Analyst also served 
as the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative for several program office contracts and 
provides overall management of the central accommodation fund. 

x	  USCIS substantially increased their reasonable accommodation program over the past four years due 
to demand of services.  In FY10, USCIS process 418 requests for reasonable accommodations. 
Possible explanations for this increase include: 

1)   Greater awareness of the central accommodation fund managed by  USCIS;  
2)   Managers’ improved ability to identify accommodation requests;  
3)   Management's increased responsiveness to requests for accommodations; and  
4)  More accurate tracking of accommodation requests. 

x	 

In partnership with EEOC, continued providing mandatory disability accommodation training for 
managers and supervisors, with more than 2,750 supervisors now having received this training since 
FY11. USCIS Director this year, made this training mandatory. This webinar was extended to 
employees this year for the first time. Training sessions were also conducted on Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD), Schedule A Hiring Authority, and Deaf Awareness and Etiquette. 

CBP: 

x	  Of the 73 requests received during FY14, 47 were approved, three were denied, and 22 were 


withdrawn, closed, pending, requested reconsideration, or appeals. 


USCG: 

x	  The number of number of accommodation requests fell from 90 to 77 with 67 approvals and ten 

denials.  

FEMA: 

x	  Received 400 reasonable accommodation requests, with 388 approvals, eight denials, and eight in a 

pending status. Although the number of accommodation requests decreased during FY14 in 
comparison to FY13, requests became more complex due to organizational changes. Examples of 
organizational changes include changes to the Disaster Reserve Workforce, additional disaster 
employment positions, and an increase in the number of employees with disabilities.  The program 
funding was allocated as follows:  Sign Language Interpreter services $1,297.216, CART $59,906, 
and Other $3,753.  FEMA also received $11,357 for 48 products and services from 
Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program.

x	  FEMA continued reinforcing its responsibility in ensuring accessible disaster operations facilities 

through continued use of the accessibility checklist.  The Disability Program Manager developed an 
innovative checklist, in FY13, using the Americans with Disabilities and Architectural Barriers Act 
(ADA/ABA) guidelines as a basis to pre-identify any disaster facility barrier and compliance 
deficiencies. This easy-to-use checklist continues to effectively enhance the Agency’s ability to 
proactively address and resolve disaster facility accessibility issues. 

x	  Budget shortfalls affected the Component’s ability to identify additional personnel resources to assist 

in handling increased accommodation activity in 2014.  Funding has been identified to secure 
personnel resources in FY15. 

FLETC:

The reconstruction also included a station with access for those using wheel chairs. This accessible 
station displays the new international accessibility symbol. 

HQ: 

x	  DHS HQ hired a new Disability Program/RA Manager (HQ DPM) to backfill a vacant position.  The 
HQ DPM increased awareness of the HQ reasonable accommodations program. As a result, HQ 
received 273 requests. Of those requests received, only one was denied one. In FY13, of the 55 
requests received, 18 were denied. HQ spent $109,228 on providing employees with sign language 
interpreter services. 

ICE: 

x	  Continued assessing its reasonable accommodation program for increased efficiencies in both 

program and process improvements. Of the 105 requests received for reasonable accommodations, 65 
were granted, none denied, with 23 withdrawn or closed.  ICE enhanced its Disability 101 Training. 
This training is available online in the ICE Virtual University.  ICE will launch its Disability 201 (RA 
Course) as a mandatory course for managers. 

x	  The Computer/Electronic Accommodation Program provided 81 products and services to ICE, a 

substantial increase above 33 provided in FY12, saving ICE $26,186.

Part I-3: High Employee Non-Retirement Separations 

STATEMENT OF CONDITION THAT  
WAS A TRIGGER FOR  A POTENTIAL 
BARRIER:   
Provide a brief narrative describing the 
condition at issue. 

The non-retirement separation rate is high and disproportionately affects certain  
groups, most notably White women. The high  separation rate also erodes efforts to 
create a workforce reflective of the nation.  

How  was the condition recognized as a 
potential barrier?  

Review of separation rates.  

BARRIER ANALYSIS:   
Provide a description of the steps taken 
and data analyzed to determine cause 

of the condition.  

DHS will perform an analysis  by  Equal Employment Opportunity protected groups 
 
and review the survey data by  Equal Employment Opportunity groups.
  

Note:  This is a multi-year plan  which carries over into future years.
  

STATEMENT OF IDENTIFIED  
BARRIER:   
Provide a succinct  statement of  the  
agency policy, procedure or practice  
that has been determined to be the 
barrier of the undesired condition.  

The Federal Employee Retirement System provides “portable” retirement benefits, 
meaning employees can take their retirement benefits  with them if  they  move to the 
private sector.  In the last few  years, the resignation rate has surpassed the 
retirement rate across the Federal government.  DHS is developing the analytic tools 
to study resignations more carefully.  An  exit  survey, first implemented  in the 
second quarter of FY11, is providing  additional insight into what is driving  
resignations and what may be done to stem the flow.  

OBJECTIVE:  
State the alternative or revised agency 
policy, procedure or practice to be 
implemented to correct  the undesired 
condition.  

Identify any trends in resignations and reduce the overall rates by improving 
employee satisfaction.

Report of Accomplishments and Modifications to Objective 

Activity #1 

•	  DHS implemented and deployed a Department-wide web-based exit survey.  The top reasons separating employees 

listed for leaving were similar to reasons given in prior years: 

o	  Lack of advancement opportunities  

o	  Problems with supervisor/management, and 

o	  Family related/personal reasons. 

•	 

Furthermore, employees were most likely to have a problem with their second level manager, as opposed to their 

immediate supervisor or leadership.  A lack of management skills and communication skills were the most common 

problems separating employees had with their managers.  This could reflect a need to have more management 

training when promoting employees who are subject matter experts, even though they have little, if any, 

management experience. 

Activity #2 

•	  The 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey continued on a downward trend with respect to DHS employee job 

satisfaction.  Both OCHCO and CRCL are analyzing the Survey data, and the DHS leadership strongly supports 

measures to increase employee satisfaction at DHS.

•	  Because the Components within DHS differ greatly in terms of size, mission, and demands they place on their 

employees, Survey data is best analyzed at the Component level.  The larger DHS Components (TSA and CBP) tend 

to drive the overall results, which can mask feedback seen at the smaller Components. 

•	  The New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) instructor certification was received by two DHS practitioners; a DHS 

version of the New IQ training was developed with projected delivery of the pilot training sessions in FY15. 

•	  DHS’s Executive Steering Committee continued to review the DHS Survey results and to make recommendations 

for improvement.  The OCHCO chairs this committee, with representatives from all DHS Components. 

Activity #3 

•	  Review of separation data showed little variation from prior years.  Non-voluntary separation by Black males and 

Black females was identified as a trigger for further analysis. 

•	  A review of promotion data shows little variation from prior years.  One encouraging finding is that for the second 

consecutive year, White females were promoted at a rate that is in proportion to their workforce participation rate. 

•	  Activity #4 

•	  DHS established the Office of Academic Engagement to leverage relationships with the academic community and 

the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, which will provide advice and recommendations to the 

Secretary and senior leadership on matters relating to student and recent graduate recruitment; international students; 

academic research; campus and community resiliency, security and preparedness; and faculty exchanges. 

•	  DHS Components continue to promote participation in their career development programs, academic programs, and 

learning training programs sponsored by their organization and/or other government agencies.  In addition, DHS 

employees have or will have access to training/career development courses through: 

o	  DHS’s Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program and the DHS Fellows Program, 

which are promoted/advertised Department-wide.  

o	  DHScovery—DHS, in partnership with SkillSoft, offers almost 20,000 online learning resources.  

These online resources can be used as quick references, as practical job aids to gain in-depth 

knowledge, or to practice skills.  These resources are subject to mapping to support competencies, job 

roles, or blended learning offerings. 

o	  Leadership Development Channel is a resource that includes videos with the most current ideas, 

information, and know-how on business and leadership topics to address the informal learning needs of 

an organization. 

•	  Eight of nine DHS Components have a formal Career Development Program. 

Activities #5-#6 

•	  Advertising for Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program and DHS Fellows is ongoing via email, 

the DHS website, and other avenues of communication. 

•	 

FY14 marked the first year that all nine DHS Components have formal mentoring programs in place.

•	  All DHS Components will provide training to mentors, evaluate the program, and provide feedback on its successes 

and areas of improvement. 

Activity #7 

•	  Analysis was conducted of the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program and the DHS Fellows 

Program as feeder pools. 

o	  The DHS SES Candidate Development Pool Cohort III commenced August 2014 

o	  Women participation rates have increased from Cohort I (34.1%) to Cohort III (36.2%) 

o	  Hispanic/Latino participation rates have significantly increased from Cohort I (2.3%) to Cohort II 

(8.5%) 

o	  Participation rates for Blacks/African Americans have also increased (from 13.7% to 17.0%) 

o	  19.1% of the participants are Veterans and 4.3% of Veterans with Disabilities are participating in this 

Cohort 

•	  CRCL conducted a study for the newly established Women Executives (WE) at DHS, an employee advocacy group.  

The study identified the composition of Executive feeder pools in each of the DHS Components, and how males and 

females differed in whether they were hired into Executive positions from the outside, or converted internally.  The 

study yielded results that require follow-up analysis.  One problem assessing Executive hires pertains to insufficient 

amount of data points created in any particular year.

Goals for  
Targeted 
Disabilities  

Agencies with 1,000 or more permanent employees are to use the space provided below to describe the 
strategies and activities that will be undertaken during the coming  fiscal  year to maintain a special 
recruitment program  for individuals with targeted disabilities and to establish  specific goals for the 
employment and advancement of such individuals. For these purposes, targeted disabilities  may be 
considered as a group. Agency goals should be set and accomplished in such a manner as will affect 
measurable progress from the preceding fiscal year. Agencies are encouraged to set a goal for the hiring of  
individuals with targeted disabilities that is at least as high as the anticipated losses from this group during  
the next reporting period, with the objective of avoiding a decrease in the total participation rate of  
employees with  disabilities.  

Goals, objectives and strategies described below should focus on internal as well as external sources of 
candidates and include discussions of activities undertaken to identify individuals with targeted disabilities 
who can be (1) hired; (2) placed in such a way as to improve possibilities for career development; and (3) 
advanced to a position at a higher level or with greater potential than the position currently occupied. 

1. Recruitment/Hiring: 

x 

Implement plan for recruitment and retention of Individuals with Disabilities and with Targeted 
Disabilities, in accordance with the President’s Executive Order  13548 and the U.S. Office of  
Personnel Management’s requirement for Model Strategies for Recruitment and Hiring of Individuals 
with Disabilities. 

x   Establish performance targets and numerical goals for major areas and occupations.  
x   Establish targets by Components to fully participate in the Workforce Recruitment Program.   
x   Expand the number of outreach and recruiting events. 
x   Establish national contacts  to move the program beyond Washington, D.C. 
x   Expand the use of centralized funds to provide reasonable accommodations.  
x   Ensure  that tentative job  offers include information about availability of reasonable accommodations.

the internal availability of candidates from underrepresented groups for job advancement 
opportunities.  The assessment includes job-related skills, knowledge, and abilities that may be 
obtained at lower levels in the same or similar occupational series, or through other experience.  The 
assessment also includes education levels.  

x   Promote the Computer/Electronic Accommodation Program to retain employees with disabilities.  
x  
Implement one program for consistent, uniform tracking and monitoring DHS’s reasonable 
accommodation program.  

x  Explore sponsoring a career-counseling event for employees with disabilities, modeled on a new 

program instituted at FEMA for all employees.
