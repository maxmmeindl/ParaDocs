FY 2020 

Affirmative Action Plan 
for the Recruitment, Hiring, Advancement, and 
Retention of Persons with Disabilities 

To capture agencies’ affirmative action plan for persons with disabilities (PWD) and persons with targeted disabilities (PWTD), 
EEOC regulations (29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(e)) and MD-715 require agencies to describe how their affirmative action plan will 
improve the recruitment, hiring, advancement, and retention of applicants and employees with disabilities. 

Section I: Efforts to Reach Regulatory Goals 
EEOC regulations (29 CFR §1614.203(d)(7)) require agencies to establish specific numerical goals for increasing the participation 
of persons with disabilities and persons with targeted disabilities in the federal government 

1.  Using the goal of 12% as the benchmark, does your agency have a trigger involving PWD by grade level cluster in the 

permanent workforce? If “yes”, describe the trigger(s) in the text box. 

a. Cluster GS-1 to GS-10 (PWD) 

b. Cluster GS-11 to SES (PWD) 

Answer  No 

Answer  No 

Table B4-1Per. FEMA is meeting this benchmark. The percentage of PWD in cluster GS-1 to GS-10 is 25.07%. The percentage of 
PWD in cluster GS-11 to SES is 25.69%. 

*For GS employees, please use two clusters: GS-1 to GS-10 and GS-11 to SES, as set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(d)(7). For all 
other pay plans, please use the approximate grade clusters that are above or below GS-11 Step 1 in the Washington, DC 
metropolitan region. 

2.  Using the goal of 2% as the benchmark, does your agency have a trigger involving PWTD by grade level cluster in the 

permanent workforce? If “yes”, describe the trigger(s) in the text box. 

a. Cluster GS-1 to GS-10 (PWTD) 

b. Cluster GS-11 to SES (PWTD) 

Answer  No 

Answer  No 

Table B4-1Per. FEMA is meeting this benchmark. The percentage of PWTD in cluster GS-1 to GS-10 is 3.73%. The percentage of 
PWTD in cluster GS-11 to SES is 2.45%.

3.  Describe how the agency has communicated the numerical goals to the hiring managers and/or recruiters. 

The Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO) and Office of Equal Rights (OER) identified specific 
priorities and action items with the Program Offices (PO) and Regional Offices (RO), regarding their responsibilities for the annual 
hiring goal for PWD and PWTD. The numerical goal was provided to hiring managers annually. The PO and RO received monthly 
progress reports on the changes in workforce participation rates.

Section II: Model Disability Program 
Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(d)(1), agencies must ensure sufficient staff, training and resources to recruit and hire persons with 
disabilities and persons with targeted disabilities, administer the reasonable accommodation program and special emphasis program, 
and oversee any other disability hiring and advancement program the agency has in place. 

A. PLAN TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT & COMPETENT STAFFING FOR THE DISABILITY 
PROGRAM 

1.  Has the agency designated sufficient qualified personnel to implement its disability program during the reporting period? 

If “no”, describe the agency’s plan to improve the staffing for the upcoming year. 

Answer  Yes 

In FY20, the Office of Equal Rights (OER) Disability Unit’s Reasonable Accommodation Program was staffed with four employees 
and is in the process of obtaining additional staffing and resources to support the RA Program. FEMA OCCHCO has a dedicated 
Selective Placement Program Coordinator (SPPC). The SPPC is responsible for developing, managing and evaluating FEMA’s 
Employment program for Individuals with Disabilities. The SPPC strives to help FEMA meet hiring objectives and enculturates the 
use of special hiring authorities for PWD and PWTD across the enterprise.

Section IV: Plan to Recruit and Hire Individuals with Disabilities 
Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(d)(1)(i) and (ii), agencies must establish a plan to increase the recruitment and hiring of 
individuals with disabilities. The questions below are designed to identify outcomes of the agency’s recruitment program plan for 
PWD and PWTD 

A. PLAN TO IDENTIFY JOB APPLICATIONS WITH DISABILITIES 

1.  Describe the programs and resources the agency uses to identify job applicants with disabilities, including individuals with 

targeted disabilities. 

The FEMA Recruitment Team, Selective Placement Program Coordinator and Disability Program Manager continues to assist in 
increasing the current network of contacts and relationships with organizations that serve PWD/PWTD. All work together to 
increase contacts at the Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services, Non-Paid Work Experience Program, America Job 
Centers, State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies, Centers for Independent Living, and Employment Network Service Providers to 
provide experience and potential job opportunities to individuals with targeted disabilities. These partnerships with community, 
academic and governmental groups have reached individuals with targeted disabilities to maximize recruiting from all sources when 
filling positions GS-11 and above, including managerial and supervisory positions at grades GS-13 to GS-15 and SES. 

2.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(a)(3), describe the agency’s use of hiring authorities that take disability into account 

(e.g., Schedule A) to recruit PWD and PWTD for positions in the permanent workforce 

The Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO) use the Schedule A appointing authority and eligible 30% 
or more disabled veterans, to identify and hire qualified PWD and PWTD professionals for positions in the permanent workforce. 
The OCCHCO recruited PWD and PWTD under the 30% or more disabled veterans hiring authority at veteran career fairs 
sponsored by the Departments of Defense and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at several venues (in-person and virtual) across the 
country. The SPPC worked with contacts at the Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services to recruit PWD and PWTD under 
Schedule A or 30% or more disabled veterans. Job opportunity announcements included statements indicating that FEMA 
encourages and will accept applications from veterans with compensable disabilities of 30% or more disabled veterans and persons 
with disabilities. 

3.  When individuals apply for a position under a hiring authority that takes disability into account (e.g., Schedule A), explain 
how the agency (1) determines if the individual is eligible for appointment under such authority; and, (2) forwards the 
individual's application to the relevant hiring officials with an explanation of how and when the individual may be 
appointed. 

The OCCHCO HR Specialists determine if applicants are eligible for appointment under special hiring authorities in 5 CFR 
§213.31.02(u). The HR specialists ensure that the application packages from a PWD or PWTD applicant include the following: For 
Schedule A Eligible candidates: (cid:127) Current Resume with places and dates of employment, including month/year to month/year and 
number of hours worked per week (e.g. 40 hours, 32 hours, etc.) (cid:127) Schedule A Letter from a licensed medical professional (e.g., a 
physician or other medical professional duly certified by a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, to practice medicine); 
a licensed vocational rehabilitation specialist (State or private); or any Federal agency, State agency, or an agency of the District of 
Columbia or a U.S. territory that issues or provides disability benefits as described in 5 CFR §213.3102 (3) (ii) For Eligible 
Disabled Veteran candidates: (cid:127) Current Resume with places and dates of employment, including month/year to month/year and 
number of hours worked per week (e.g. 40 hours, 32 hours, etc.) (cid:127) DD-214, Record of Military Service (member copy 4) to 
determine eligibility for veteran’s preference and honorable discharge (cid:127) SF-15 stating the Veteran has a 30% or more disability 
rating (cid:127) Veterans Affairs Rating Letter that identifies the disability 30% + rating for the applicant HR Specialist forwards the 
applications to the hiring officials and meets with them to explain the hiring flexibilities, how and when the applicant may be 
appointed non-competitively and provides guidance on the hiring authorities. 

4.  Has the agency provided training to all hiring managers on the use of hiring authorities that take disability into account 

(e.g., Schedule A)? If “yes”, describe the type(s) of training and frequency. If “no”, describe the agency’s plan to provide

Answer  Yes 

Formal and informal training on the use of the hiring authorities that take disability into account was provided to managers and 
supervisors during the year as part of the FEMA annual mandatory training requirements. All managers and hiring officials are 
individually provided guidance and training from the Selective Placement Program Coordinator, HR Specialist and Recruiters on 
the use of special hiring authorities to directly appoint PWD and PWTD. 

B. PLAN TO ESTABLISH CONTACTS WITH DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT ORGANIZATIONS 

Describe the agency’s efforts to establish and maintain contacts with organizations that assist PWD, including PWTD, in 
securing and maintaining employment. 

FEMA maintains a Disability Employee Resource Group with an SES champion to serve as an advocate at the senior level to act as 
a catalyst for change and to advise. FEMA continues to engage executive champions by implementing a diversity and inclusion 
council. The council focused on internal policies and practices, talent recruitment and development, education and training, 
identifying barriers, building partnerships with rehabilitation agencies, measuring the effectiveness of the diversity initiative 
process, and ensuring transparency of its operations. FEMA OCCHCO and OER continue to assist in increasing the current network 
of contacts and relationships with organizations that serve PWD/PWTDs. We work together to increase contacts at colleges/ 
universities; State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies including Virginia Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services, 
Maryland Division of Rehabilitation Services, DC Department of Disability Services, and other disability organizations. FEMA also 
maintains contacts with "Hiring Our Heroes" organization, VA Vocational Rehabilitation Services, and RecruitMilitary, all which 
target PWDs and Disabled Veterans. FEMA OCCHCO also partnered with the Department of Defense (DOD), Operation 
Warfighter (OWF) Regional Coordinators to provide briefings and guidance on applying for federal positions.

Disclaimer: The Applicant Tracking System labels applicants as qualified based on the applicant self-identifying as qualified but 
their qualifications were not verified by an HR specialist. This would cause the data to show far more qualified applicants than 
applicants qualified by an HR specialist, creating the appearance of triggers where there may not be triggers. Table B6-1-9 (PER). 
Using the qualified external applicant pool as the benchmark, triggers exist for the PWD new hires in the following MCOs: (cid:127) 0089 –

3.  Using the relevant applicant pool as the benchmark, do triggers exist for PWD and/or PWTD among the qualified internal 
applicants for any of the mission-critical occupations (MCO)? If “yes”, please describe the triggers below. Select “n/a” if 
the applicant data is not available for your agency, and describe your plan to provide the data in the text box. 

a. Qualified Applicants for MCO (PWD) 

b. Qualified Applicants for MCO (PWTD) 

Answer  N/A 

Answer  N/A 

Relevant applicant pool data is not available. Identifying which current DHS employees would qualify for a job series they are not 
currently in is a difficult undertaking. The Human Capital offices do not adjudicate applicant qualifications until an applicant 
applies for a specific position, and the applicant may qualify based on experience obtained prior to entry into their current job series, 
or into DHS. DHS has not attempted to develop an estimate for job series-relevant applicant pools to date. Based on this, we are not 
attempting to tabulate relevant applicant pools for this reporting cycle. 

4.  Using the qualified applicant pool as the benchmark, do triggers exist for PWD and/or PWTD among employees promoted 

to any of the mission- critical occupations (MCO)? If “yes”, please describe the triggers below. Select “n/a” if the 
applicant data is not available for your agency, and describe your plan to provide the data in the text box.

Section V: Plan to Ensure Advancement Opportunities for Employees with 
Disabilities 
Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(d)(1)(iii), agencies are required to provide sufficient advancement opportunities for employees 
with disabilities. Such activities might include specialized training and mentoring programs, career development opportunities, 
awards programs, promotions, and similar programs that address advancement. In this section, agencies should identify, and provide 
data on programs designed to ensure advancement opportunities for employees with disabilities. 

A. ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM PLAN 

Describe the agency’s plan to ensure PWD, including PWTD, have sufficient opportunities for advancement. 

FEMA provides training opportunities and encourages all employees, including veterans and disabled veterans, to take advantage of 
career development opportunities. In addition, FEMA participates in internal career development programs, including the FEMA 
Emerging Leaders Program and the Future Leader Program, which combines in-person, independent and online activities for a year- 
long program so that employees may receive intensive developmental assignments to prepare and qualify them for the targeted 
series and grade. These career development programs include a mandatory mentoring component. Other career developmental 
opportunities include the use of employee rotation/detail (temporary assignments) to other offices or components. Additionally, 
FEMA has a mentoring program open to all employees, including PWD and PWTD, which facilitates junior-to-senior and peer-to- 
peer mentoring relationships. 

B. CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITES 

1.  Please describe the career development opportunities that the agency provides to its employees. 

Within the Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO), the Office of the Chief Learning Officer (OCLO) 
offers high-impact developmental programs and services to employees nation-wide in order to strengthen the Agency’s ability to 
support our citizens and first responders. The goal is to develop leaders at all levels from emerging leaders or high performing 
individuals to executive level personnel. OCLO provides a variety of supervisory and leadership development opportunities within a 
tiered progression framework and single competency-based learning programs/courses. OCLO supports two of the FEMA Strategic 
Plan 2018-2022 Strategic Objectives: (cid:127) Objective 2.1: Organize the “BEST” (Build, Empower, Sustain, and Train) scalable and 
capable incident workforce. (cid:127) Objective 3.3: Develop innovative systems and business processes that enable FEMA’s employees to 
rapidly and effectively deliver the Agency’s mission. OCLO provides oversight for leader development programs, mentoring, 
rotations, mandatory training, competency-based assessment, policy, and guidance, and other professional development 
opportunities. Also, as part of OCLO’s career development related efforts, the Career Path Tool (CPT) pathing enables employees 
to identify internal opportunities based on their own skills, experiences, competencies, interests, and preferences – The CPT maps 
and outlines career paths for employees to include career path information for movement within and across roles in their functional 
community, important competencies and proficiency levels for each path; and suggested developmental opportunities (e.g., formal 
training, mentoring, on the job) for each role. 

2.  In the table below, please provide the data for career development opportunities that require competition and/or 

supervisory recommendation/ approval to participate.

applicants qualified by an HR specialist, creating the appearance of triggers where there may not be triggers. FEMA has triggers 
involving PWTD among the selectees for promotions to senior grade levels for the following: 1. SES - Selectees – The Qualified 
Internal Applicants is 1.64% and the Internal Selections is 0% 2. GS 15 - Selectees – The Qualified Internal Applicants is 3.03% 
and the Internal Selections is 0% 3. GS 14 - Selectees – The Qualified Internal Applicants is 5.35% and the Internal Selections is 
1.34% 4. GS 13- Selectees – The Qualified Internal Applicants is 8.68% and the Internal Selections is 1.57% 

3.  Using the qualified applicant pool as the benchmark, does your agency have a trigger involving PWD among the new hires 
to the senior grade levels? For non-GS pay plans, please use the approximate senior grade levels. If “yes”, describe the 
trigger(s) in the text box. Select “n/a” if the applicant data is not available for your agency, and describe your plan to

Section VI: Plan to Improve Retention of Persons with Disabilities 
To be model employer for persons with disabilities, agencies must have policies and programs in place to retain employees with 
disabilities. In this section, agencies should: (1) analyze workforce separation data to identify barriers retaining employees with 
disabilities; (2) describe efforts to ensure accessibility of technology and facilities; and (3) provide information on the reasonable 
accommodation program and workplace assistance services. 

A. VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY SEPARATIONS 

1.  In this reporting period, did the agency convert all eligible Schedule A employees with a disability into the competitive 
service after two years of satisfactory service (5 C.F.R. § 213.3102(u)(6)(i))? If “no”, please explain why the agency did 
not convert all eligible Schedule A employees. 

Answer  No 

FEMA has met this benchmark. 

2.  Using the inclusion rate as the benchmark, did the percentage of PWD among voluntary and involuntary separations 

exceed that of persons without disabilities? If “yes”, describe the trigger below. 

a.Voluntary Separations (PWD) 

b.Involuntary Separations (PWD) 

Answer  Yes 

Answer  Yes 

FEMA has triggers involving PWD among the following separations (Table B1): a) Voluntary Separations – Persons with no 
Disabilities is 4.09% and Persons with Disabilities is 4.20% b) Involuntary Separations - Persons with no Disabilities is 3.92% and 
Persons with Disabilities is 5.81%

4.  If a trigger exists involving the separation rate of PWD and/or PWTD, please explain why they left the agency using exit 

interview results and other data sources. 

FEMA encourages all employees to complete the Department of Homeland Security’s Exit Survey when leaving the agency. In 
FY20, FEMA did not assess exit interview results and other data sources for triggers. 

B. ACCESSIBILITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES 

Pursuant to 29 CFR §1614.203(d)(4), federal agencies are required to inform applicants and employees of their rights under Section 
508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794(b), concerning the accessibility of agency technology, and the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. § 4151-4157), concerning the accessibility of agency facilities. In addition, agencies are required to 
inform individuals where to file complaints if other agencies are responsible for a violation. 

1.  Please provide the internet address on the agency’s public website for its notice explaining employees’ and applicants’ 

rights under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, including a description of how to file a complaint. 

https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/equal-rights/accessibility https://training.fema.gov/devres/508.aspx 

2.  Please provide the internet address on the agency’s public website for its notice explaining employees’ and applicants’ 

rights under the 
Architectural Barriers Act, including a description of how to file a complaint. 

FEMA is in the process of revamping the Public facing website and will include this information. 

3.  Describe any programs, policies, or practices that the agency has undertaken, or plans on undertaking over the next fiscal 

year, designed to improve accessibility of agency facilities and/or technology. 

With the increased use of virtual platforms for employees to attend meetings, trainings, and other FEMA events, OER has worked 
with OCIO to ensure accessibility of these platforms. For all meetings, trainings and events hosted in ZOOM or Adobe Connect, 
OER is able to provide virtual interpreting or captioning services through existing service contracts. OER will be providing virtual 
interpreting services in MS Teams in FY21. By providing these services, employees who are deaf or hard of hearing are able to 
actively participate in their normal day to day meetings, training and other events without accessibility issues. 

C. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM 

Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(d)(3), agencies must adopt, post on their public website, and make available to all job applicants 
and employees, reasonable accommodation procedures. 

1.  Please provide the average time frame for processing initial requests for reasonable accommodations during the reporting 

period. (Please do not include previously approved requests with repetitive accommodations, such as interpreting services.) 

During FY20, reasonable accommodation requests were processed in an average timeframe of 47 days 

2. 

Page 21

DHS Federal Emergency Management 
Agency

FY 2020

Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the agency’s reasonable accommodation 
program. Some examples of an effective program include timely processing requests, timely providing approved 
accommodations, conducting training for managers and supervisors, and monitoring accommodation requests for trends. 

The Office of Equal Rights provides funding for reasonable accommodations which does not impact individual office budgets and 
therefore, promotes the timely processing of RA cases. Supervisors and managers receive mandatory training as part of a Trilogy 
Training, which includes EEO laws and rules. 

D. PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
WORKPLACE 
Pursuant to 29 CFR §1614.203(d)(5), federal agencies, as an aspect of affirmative action, are required to provide personal 
assistance services (PAS) to employees who need them because of a targeted disability, unless doing so would impose an undue 
hardship on the agency. 

Describe the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, or practices to implement the PAS requirement. Some examples of 
an effective program include timely processing requests for PAS, timely providing approved services, conducting training 
for managers and supervisors, and monitoring PAS requests for trends. 

FEMA is in the process of updating its reasonable accommodation policy manual to include information on Personal Assistance 
Services. Currently FEMA allows employees with disabilities who travel for work purposes to bring a companion with them 
through invitational travel to assist with activities of daily living while on travel. 

Section VII: EEO Complaint and Findings Data 

A. EEO COMPLAINT DATA INVOLVING HARASSMENT 

1.  During the last fiscal year, did a higher percentage of PWD file a formal EEO complaint alleging harassment, as compared 

to the governmentwide average? 

2.  During the last fiscal year, did any complaints alleging harassment based on disability status result in a finding of 

discrimination or a settlement agreement? 

Answer  Yes 

3.  If the agency had one or more findings of discrimination alleging harassment based on disability status during the last 

fiscal year, please describe the corrective measures taken by the agency. 

Answer  No 

Component 462 FEMA reached settlement agreements for three complaints alleging harassment based on the rehab act. The 
corrective action(s) follows: 1) one received training; (2) a second received reassignment; (3) the third received equipment and 
reassignment 

B. EEO COMPLAINT DATA INVOLVING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION 

1.  During the last fiscal year, did a higher percentage of PWD file a formal EEO complaint alleging failure to provide a 

reasonable 
accommodation, as compared to the government-wide average? 

2.  During the last fiscal year, did any complaints alleging failure to provide reasonable accommodation result in a finding of 

discrimination or a settlement agreement? 

Answer  No 

Answer  No

FY 2020

3.  If the agency had one or more findings of discrimination involving the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation 

during the last fiscal year, please describe the corrective measures taken by the agency. 

Section VIII: Identification and Removal of Barriers 
Element D of MD-715 requires agencies to conduct a barrier analysis when a trigger suggests that a policy, procedure, or practice 
may be impeding the employment opportunities of a protected EEO group. 

1.  Has the agency identified any barriers (policies, procedures, and/or practices) that affect employment opportunities for 

PWD and/or PWTD? 

2.  Has the agency established a plan to correct the barrier(s) involving PWD and/or PWTD? 

Answer  No 

3.  Identify each trigger and plan to remove the barrier(s), including the identified barrier(s), objective(s), responsible 

official(s), planned activities, and, where applicable, accomplishments
