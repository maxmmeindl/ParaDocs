Subject: Request to consider Reassignment - Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort

Good morning, Max,

After the interactive process considering your position description (attached), the essential
functions of your position, and your request for an accommodation (to work from home 100%),
management has denied your reasonable accommodation request for the reasons indicated in
the attached 256-02 form.

If you believe that you are no longer able to perform the essential functions of your position, you

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may request that the Agency consider reassigning you if there is a funded, open position,
consistent with page 19 of the attached FEMA Instruction on Reasonable Accommodation. 
Please note that all FEMA positions require the ability to deploy and other positions may not be
able to facilitate an accommodation that requires 100% work from home without the ability to
deploy. 

If you would like to go this route, please respond by COB no later than August 23, 2024.

Respectfully,
Anna Myers

14. Detailed reason(s) for the denial of reasonable accommodation (Must be specific, e.g., why accommodation is ineffective or causes undue hardship):

Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  It is understood that Mr. Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is 
close to his home; however, I cannot consider that in a decision to grant the request.  The option presented by Mr. Meindl is not a viable solution as I cannot 
grant him the ability to limit his deployment location.  Given that Mr. Meindl would need to be sent wherever the disaster is located and his inabilities to do would 
limit my ability, therefore, I must deny his request.

15. If the individual proposed one type of reasonable accommodation which is being denied, but rejected an offer of a different type of reasonable 
accommodation, explain both the reason for the denial of the requested accommodation and why you believe the chosen accommodation would be effective:
