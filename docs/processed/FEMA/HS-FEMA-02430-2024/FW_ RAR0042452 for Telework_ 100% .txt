Good afternoon,

This RA ticket has expired due to inactivity. If and when you have obtained sufficient medical documentation of a current disability, we invite you to re-engage in the interactive process by submitting both the
FEMA Form 256 and supporting medical documentation via the secure DHS Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS). As a reminder, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical
professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of the following information:

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.  Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;

2.  The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;

3.  The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities;

4.  Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,

5.  Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as

6.  How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

Note that individuals with a history of disability, but whom are not currently impaired in performing major life activities are not eligible for a reasonable accommodation.

Respectfully,

Well, both docs delineate my heart/cardio condition and life conditions it hinders.
I am sticking with the RA process for now.

RE:
A person with a disability is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.

Policy lists 5 criteria for medical information and you list 6.
Why the variance?

It will take a few days to get an appointment with my doctor to get the letter.

Thank you for your assistance.

Good afternoon,

I have reviewed your emails, which consisted of the same DHS COVID Vaccine Medical Exemption Form (not admissible) and screenshots from your Employee Personal Page (EPP). Once again, there is still no medical
documentation to substantiate an RA for disability.

If your SOR is willing to consider granting situational telework under the standard provisions of the telework policy, an RA for disability is not required. Please let me know if you and your SOR choose to pursue a standard
telework agreement, so that we can close out this RA ticket in a timely manner.

If your SOR will only consider granting situational telework to qualified employees with disabilities as a reasonable accommodation, please be sure to submit both your amended FF-256 and supporting medical documentation to
me by August 11th. As stated in prior emails, sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain ALL of the
following information:

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.  Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;

2.  The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;

3.  The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities;

4.  Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,

5.  Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as

6.  How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

I sent the medical information, as you referenced in the response to my supervisor approving my RA, yesterday.
Do you require any additional information to process the RA request?

Thank you for your assistance.

Thank you for contacting the OER Disability Unit.  The OER Disability Unit provides oversight to ensure the timely processing of your RA request is consistent with all relevant statutes, regulations, EEOC, case law and the FEMA
Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The deciding official for your RA request is your first line supervisor of record (SOR).  In that regard OER provides neutral, authoritative guidance to both managers/supervisors and employees
on the RA process.

Attached is the FEMA Form 256-0-1 Request for Reasonable Accommodation, as well as the FEMA Fact Sheet Guide to the Reasonable Accommodation Process and Deployments. The fact sheet explains the RA process in a
nutshell, outlines the criteria that must be met to be considered a qualified person with a disability, as well as the criteria for sufficient medical documentation. Please note that we cannot proceed with processing your
accommodation request before we receive adequate medical documentation.  The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for
employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as a person who experiences substantial impairment in performing one or more major life activities, such as walking
and hearing. 

I understand that you have requested “Continued Remote/telework, permanent exemption from the report to office mandate.
“ as an RA for disability. Note that an RA for disability is never permanent and must be reassessed annually. Furthermore, requests for indefinite periods of full-time telework are considered requests for remote work and are
subject to the policy and procedures outlined in the 
year.

 Remote Work Manual. Remote work is not considered an RA for disability, due to the aforementioned policy limiting the effective dates of an approved RA to one calendar

If you wish to pursue a request for remote work, please let us know by COB on Thursday August 11th,  so that we can update and close this RA ticket in a timely manner.

If you are a person with a disability and wish to request telework as an accommodation for your impairment, please follow the next steps outlined below. A first line supervisor of record may consider granting up to 90 days of
full-time situational telework as an RA for disability, a second line supervisor may consider extending a full-time situational telework agreement for up to one year.

NEXT STEPS:

To formalize an RA request, please amend page one of your FEMA Form 256 to include the effective dates that you are requesting full-time situational telework. Return the amended 256 to me by COB on Thursday August 18th,
along with supporting medical documentation. Medical documentation does not need to be shared with your SOR, and you may choose to remove them from the thread before sending your password protected and/or
encrypted medical documentation. Please be aware that sufficient medical documentation must come from a medical professional familiar with your disability, must be on their letterhead, signed, dated, and must contain all of
the following information:

Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:

1.  Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;

2.  The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;

3.  The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities;

4.  Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,

5.  Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as

6.  How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

The DHS COVID Vaccination Medical Exception Form uploaded with this RA request is not sufficient to substantiate an RA request of any kind. Note that this form applies only to requests for exemption from the COVID vaccination
mandate, which is not currently enforced by any Federal agency due to legal injunction. If and when DHS-HQ resumes adjudication of vaccine exemption requests, please be sure that they are in receipt of a signed DHS COVID
Vaccination Medical Exception Form. For your situational awareness, the document attached to this RA ticket was neither signed nor dated.
