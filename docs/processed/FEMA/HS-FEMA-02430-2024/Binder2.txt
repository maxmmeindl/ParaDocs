Foreword 

It is the basic policy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that 
workplace problems will be dealt with in a fair, constructive, and reasonable manner. All 
FEMA employees, supervisors and managers are expected to demonstrate acceptable 
conduct and performance at all times, as required by the ethical standards of conduct 
and other rules, regulations, and applicable laws. Fairness to those employees who 
maintain acceptable standards of performance and conduct – who conduct themselves 
properly, follow the rules, and abide by the standards – requires that appropriate action 
be taken to deal with employees who exhibit poor performance and acts of misconduct. 

When employees violate rules, regulations, policies and procedures, it is important for 
supervisors and managers to have appropriate procedures to follow. This policy will 
help to ensure that proper discipline is taken in a fair, constructive, and reasonable 
manner.  

For employees in bargaining units covered by negotiated agreements, appropriate 
negotiated agreement provisions relating to subjects in this Manual should also be 
reviewed. For bargaining unit employees, should any of these instructions conflict with a 
provision of a negotiated agreement, the agreement will prevail unless abiding by the 
agreement would be contrary to law, rule, or regulation.

1-1.  Purpose 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

This Manual prescribes the policy, procedures, and responsibilities for taking 
conduct-related discipline against employees, which will promote the effective 
and efficient operation of FEMA. The public interest requires the maintenance of 
high standards of employee integrity, conduct, effectiveness, and service to the 
public. When such standards are not met, it is essential that prompt corrective 
action be taken. FEMA’s policy is to maintain standards of conduct and efficiency 
that will positively promote the best interests of the Federal Government, FEMA, 
and the public it serves.  

The primary focus of this Manual is to guide supervisors on the procedures to 
correct misconduct. When employees commit misconduct, supervisors shall 
consider the range of applicable discipline available in accordance with the 
procedures in this Manual. These procedures also address furloughs for less 
than 30 continuous calendar days or 22 discontinuous workdays, which are 
effected for management reasons, and are not driven by employee misconduct 
or performance problems. 

1-2.  Applicability and Scope 

The primary focus of this Manual is disciplinary and adverse actions, including 
reprimands, suspensions without pay, demotions, furloughs of less than 30 
continuous calendar days or 22 discontinuous workdays, and removals. This 
Manual applies to all permanent FEMA employees hired under the authorities in 
Title 5, U.S. Code whether in FEMA Headquarters, Regions, or Field 
organizational establishments. 

Allegations of misconduct committed by FEMA employees must be addressed 
expeditiously. All employees are responsible for reporting allegations of 
misconduct in accordance with the Administrative Investigations Directive, FD 
123-19, which should be consulted for complete guidance. For example, certain 
allegations must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security, Office of 
the Inspector General (DHS/OIG) in accordance with DHS MD 0810.1. 

Often misconduct may constitute the basis for discipline and may also be 
conduct that constitutes unacceptable performance under the employee’s 
performance standards. The procedures for each differ, but are not mutually 
exclusive. The supervisor shall consult with OCCHCO/Labor and Employee 
Relations to determine whether misconduct procedures (under this manual) or 
performance procedures apply, or both. 

The policies and procedures of this Manual will apply to all disciplinary actions 
initiated on or after the effective date of this Manual. 

Excluded from the provisions of this Manual are:

1-5.  Policy 

A.  It is the policy of FEMA that disciplinary and adverse actions are to be 

effected in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth herein and 
in applicable laws and regulations. 

1.  Discipline or adverse actions may not be taken against an employee for 

any reason prohibited by 5 U.S.C. § 2302, to include politically motivated 
coercion; nepotism; or unduly influencing the competitive process; 
retaliation for exercising the employee’s legal rights, for providing truthful 
testimony; or in retaliation for an employee’s disclosure of what he or she 
reasonably believes to be a public safety risk, gross mismanagement, 
abuse of authority, a gross waste of funds, or a violation of any law, rule, 
or regulation; and   

2.  Discipline or adverse actions may not be based on discrimination because 

of age, sex, race, religion, color, national origin, disability, genetic 
information, sexual orientation, or veteran status.  

B.  Supervisors must first consult with the Labor and Employee Relations Branch, 
of the Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO) to 
determine the disciplinary action to take, and shall first consider the least 
severe discipline for the offense, depending on the nature of the offense and 
the surrounding circumstances. The goal is to correct an employee’s 
behavior. The concept of “progressive discipline” is to initiate disciplinary 
action at the lowest level possible in an effort to correct a situation before it 
becomes necessary to impose a harsher penalty. Such measures start with 
reprimands and short suspensions. However, if the first or second offense of 
misconduct is egregious or the violation of rules and regulations is flagrant, a 
severe penalty (i.e., long suspension or removal) may be imposed for that 
offense. In all cases, the manager should choose the level of penalty that will 
be appropriate and effective in preventing the employee from repeating the 

7 

 
 
misconduct, while considering the penalties given to other employees for 
similar misconduct in similar circumstances. 

C.  The nature of an employee’s appointment and length of service dictate the 
procedures to follow when considering imposition of disciplinary or adverse 
actions. The types of appointments applicable to each chapter will be 
identified at the beginning of each chapter. 

D.  Allegations of misconduct or poor performance, and any resulting disciplinary, 
adverse, or performance actions, shall only be discussed with those FEMA 
officials with a need to know in order to perform their duties. This policy is 
designed to protect employee privacy. This policy also protects FEMA, 
supervisors, and managers from allegations of discrimination, retaliation, or 
misconduct. 

1-6.  Definitions 

A.  Administrative Leave. An administratively authorized absence from duty 

without a loss of pay or charge to leave. 

B.  Adverse Action. A removal, suspension for 15 days or more (including an 
indefinite suspension), or demotion issued to an employee to correct 
misconduct or other offenses and to enforce prescribed rules of behavior. A 
furlough for less than 30 continuous calendar days or 22 discontinuous 
workdays is considered an adverse action, but is not done for disciplinary 
reasons. 

C.  Constructive Notice. When an employee is deemed to have notice of an 
action even though actual notice was not personally delivered to the 
employee. 

D.  Day. A calendar day, except when otherwise specified. 

E.  Deciding Official. The deciding official may be an employee outside of the 
supervisor chain of command, but must be properly appointed in writing by 
the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (CCHCO) or designee. (1) For 
disciplinary actions, the management official responsible for making a 
decision, who may also be the proposing official. (2) For adverse actions, the 
management official, who is at a higher level than the supervisor or the 
management official responsible for the action proposed and who was not 
involved in making or influencing a decision directly related to the action being 
proposed. (3) Note: If the Administrator is the employee’s first or second-level 
supervisor, he or she may delegate the deciding official responsibilities to 
another management official. He or she may also act as the proposing and 
deciding official in such cases. 

F.  Demotion. A change to lower grade or a decrease in pay for disciplinary 

reasons. 

G.  Disciplinary Action. A reprimand or suspension of 14 days or less issued to an 

employee to correct misconduct.  

8 

 
 
H.  Douglas Factors. The criteria supervisors must consider in determining an 
appropriate penalty to impose for an act of employee misconduct. The 
Douglas Factors are: 

1.  The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the 

employee’s duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the 
offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed 
maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated; 

2.  The employee’s job level and type of employment, including supervisory 
or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position; 

3.  The employee’s past disciplinary record; 

4.  The employee’s past work record, including length of service, performance 

on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability; 

5.  The effect of the offense upon the employee’s ability to perform at a 
satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors’ confidence in the 
employee’s ability to perform assigned duties; 

6.  Consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for 

the same or similar offenses; 

7.  Consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties; 

8.  The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the 

agency; 

9.  The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were 

violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct 
in question; 

10. Potential for the employee’s rehabilitation; 

11. Mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job 

tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad 
faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter; 
and 

12. The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such 

conduct in the future by the employee or others. 

Not all of these factors will be pertinent in every case. Deciding officials must 
balance and weigh the relevant factors in an individual case. 

I.  Furlough. The placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties 
and pay because of lack of work, funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons. 
The procedures to place employee on furlough are in Chapter 4 (adverse 
actions). 

J.  Indefinite Suspensions Without Pay. A temporary involuntary, non-duty, non-
pay status imposed due to a pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency 
action. Examples of reasons for indefinite suspensions include, suspension or 
revocation of an employee’s security clearance, or if there is a reasonable 

9 

 
belief that the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of 
imprisonment could be imposed. 

K.  Misconduct. Violation by a FEMA employee of any Federal, state, or local 

law; DHS or FEMA regulation or policy; or any other applicable standard of 
conduct. Misconduct applies not only to on-the-job conduct, but also applies 
to conduct during non-duty hours that may adversely affect FEMA personnel, 
programs, and operations. 

L.  Office or Directorate. Offices or Directorates that are at or above Level three 

in FEMA’s organizational structure: Office of the Administrator, Office of Chief 
Counsel, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of External Affairs, Office 
of Policy and Program Analysis, Office of Response and Recovery, Response 
Directorate, Recovery Directorate, Logistics Management Directorate, 
Protection and National Preparedness, National Preparedness Directorate, 
National Continuity Programs Directorate, Grant Program Directorate, Mission 
Support, Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, Office of the Chief 
Component Human Capital Officer, Office of the Chief Information Officer, 
Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, Office of the Chief Security Officer, 
Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, Federal Insurance 
Administration (FIA) Mitigation, FIA Insurance, United States Fire 
Administration, and Offices of Regional Administrators. 

M.  Probationary Period. The first year of Federal service of an employee who is 
given a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service. 
An employee who is promoted, demoted, or reassigned before completing a 
probationary period is required to complete a probationary period in the new 
position (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.801). 

N.  Proposing Official. The supervisor or manager who initiates an adverse 

action, or a suspension without pay for 14 days or less. In most cases, the 
proposing official should be a lower level supervisor within the employee’s 
chain of command, but does not have to be the immediate supervisor. The 
proposing official may be an employee outside of the supervisory chain of 
command but, if so, must be properly appointed in writing by the Chief 
Component Human Capital Officer (CCHCO) or designee. In disciplinary 
actions, the proposing official and the deciding official may be the same 
person. 

O.  Removal. An involuntary separation of an employee from the Agency.  

P.  Reprimand. A written statement of censure given to an employee for minor 
misconduct, which may be placed in the employee’s official personnel file.  

Q.  Supervisor. An employee with the delegated authority to discipline and 

remove an employee from Federal service in accordance with the procedures 
found in this Manual. 

R.  Suspension. The placing of an employee in an involuntary, non-duty, non-pay 
status for disciplinary reasons. Suspensions may be “indefinite” when the 

10 

 
Agency is conducting an investigation or inquiry and in other appropriate 
circumstances. 

S.  Temporary Employee. An employee hired to a short-term position, in the 

competitive service, that is not expected to last longer than one year (see 5 
C.F.R. Part 316, Subpart D). 

T.  Term Employee. An employee hired to a non-permanent position, in the 

competitive service, for more than one year, but less than four years (see 5 
C.F.R. Part 316, Subpart C). 

U.  Trial Period. A period of service, usually one or two years, before certain 

categories of employees, such as most excepted service employees, obtain a 
vested interest in their employment.

2-2. 

Initiating Disciplinary Actions 

Disciplinary Actions include official reprimands and suspensions of 14 days or 
less. An official reprimand is the lowest form of discipline. Supervisors must 
provide all documentation related to the alleged offense to the ER Specialist for 
review. The ER Specialist will draft the recommended action for review and 
signature by the supervisor. 

A.  Official Reprimand. This is a memorandum issued by a supervisor (or 
manager in the supervisory chain) and addressed to the employee.  

1.  The memorandum will include the following information: 

i.  Cite, specifically and in detail, the facts that support the reprimand, 

including rules or regulations violated. There must be sufficient detail to 
give the employee or an individual unacquainted with the situation a 
clear understanding of the reason so that the employee can grieve or 
prepare a reply; 

ii.  State the date and type of previous discipline, if any, relied upon to 

support the action; 

14 

 
 
iii.  State that the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available for 

assistance and include the phone number, if appropriate; 

iv.  Advise the employee of the potential for negative consequences for 

future misconduct; 

v.  If the supervisor decides to place the official reprimand in the 

employee’s Official Personnel File (OPF), state that a copy of the 
reprimand will be placed in the employee’s OPF for a specified period, 
up to three years, unless there is sufficient cause to remove it sooner; 

vi.  State the name and contact information of the servicing ER Specialist 

who may be contacted for advice and assistance; and 

vii. Provide applicable grievance rights and right to file a complaint with the 

Office of Equal Rights. 

2.  The supervisor shall: 

i.  Deliver the official reprimand to the employee in person in a private 

meeting. If personal delivery at work is not possible, or appropriate, the 
reprimand may be mailed or emailed to the employee. If the reprimand 
is mailed to the employee, the employee will be required to sign for the 
letter to show proof of delivery. The supervisor should ask employee to 
acknowledge receipt of the reprimand by signing and dating the last 
page, where indicated. Acknowledgement of receipt does not imply 
that the employee agrees with the action -- it simply indicates that the 
employee received a copy of the notice. If the employee refuses to 
acknowledge receipt, the supervisor should annotate the last page of 
the notice, stating that the employee refused to sign for it; and  

ii.  Deliver a signed and dated copy (with employee’s signature, if 

available) to the ER Specialist, so that a copy can be placed in the 
employee’s OPF, if applicable. 

B.  Suspensions without pay for 14 days or less. A notice of proposal is required 

prior to imposition of a suspension.  

1.  The proposal notice must: 

i. 

Identify, specifically, the proposed penalty and the reason or charge 
(i.e., notice of proposal to suspend from duty for five calendar days for 
absence without approved leave); 

ii.  Describe, in detail, the facts and relevant information used to support 

the proposed action; 

iii.  Cite the laws, rules, regulations, and/or FEMA policies violated (if 

applicable);

penalty; and 

v.  Specify the employee’s rights, including: 

15 

 
a.  A specific amount of time (no less than 5 days) to respond orally 
and/or in writing to the proposed action, and a right to submit 
affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the 
response (if the last day of the response period falls on a weekend 
or Federal holiday, the response will be due the following business 
day); 

b.  A reasonable amount of official time to prepare a reply if the 

employee is working during the proposal period. Normally, four to 
ten hours is granted, depending on the severity of the proposed 
penalty; 

c.  Representation by an attorney or other representative, at the 

employee’s own expense;  

d.  Review of the material relied on to support the proposed penalty; 

e.  A written decision that includes the specific reasons for the final 

decision; and 

f.  Receipt of the decision notice on or before the date the action will 

be effective; 

vi.  State other pertinent information and facts, including analysis of 
relevant “Douglas Factors”, relied upon in proposing the penalty;

the employee can make arrangements for a personal reply and the fax 
number or email address where the written reply should be sent; 

ix.  Inform the employee that requests for additional time to reply should 

be in writing and addressed to the ER Specialist for consideration. The 
request must identify the amount of time needed along with an 
explanation. The ER Specialist will coordinate requests for additional 
time with the servicing deciding official; 

x.  State the name and contact information of the servicing ER Specialist 
who may be contacted to make arrangements to obtain the material 
relied upon in proposing the action and for advice and assistance; and   

xi.  Be delivered to the employee in person in a private meeting. The 

supervisor should ask the employee to acknowledge receipt of the 
document by placing their signature and date on the last page of the 
notice, where indicated. Acknowledgement of receipt does not imply 
that the employee agrees with the action -- it simply indicates that the 
employee received a copy of the notice. If the employee refuses to 
acknowledge receipt, the supervisor should annotate the last page of 
the notice, stating that the employee refused to sign. If personal 
delivery at work is not possible, the notice may be mailed and/or 

16 

 
emailed to the employee, with a return or read receipt requested to 
show proof of delivery or attempt to deliver. If the notice is mailed to 
the employee, the employee will be required to sign for the letter to 
show proof of delivery. Forward a signed/dated copy (with employee’s 
signature, if available) to the ER Specialist. 

xii. Once a proposal notice is issued, a proposing or deciding official shall 
only discuss the matter with the servicing ER Specialist or advising 
attorney. The proposing official or deciding official must not discuss the 
proposal, any reply, or decision, except with the approval of the 
assigned ER Specialist or advising attorney. 

2.  Final Decision. After the employee’s reply period has expired, the deciding 

official must consult with the assigned ER Specialist. Together, the 
deciding official and the ER Specialist shall evaluate the evidence. This 
includes all documentation in support of the charge(s), as well as any 
evidence favorable to the employee and all information and arguments 
submitted by the employee and/or representative. Prior to issuing a final 
decision, the deciding official will: 

i.  Determine which, if any, of the reasons are supported by a 

preponderance of the evidence (based on the weight of evidence, the 
allegation is more likely true than untrue); 

ii.  Decide if there is a connection (“nexus”) between the misconduct and 

the efficiency of the service; and 

iii.  Uphold or reduce the proposed penalty, considering the appropriate 

“Douglas Factors”. 

3.  The ER Specialist will draft the decision letter in coordination with the 

deciding official. The final decision notice must: 

i.  Cite the notice of proposed action, the decision, and effective date of 

action;  

ii.  Indicate whether the employee replied (orally and/or in writing) and, if 

so, that the reply was considered; 

iii.  State the charge(s) that have been supported and which, if any, have 
not (deciding official may not use or rely on any information that was 
not disclosed to the employee to support the basis for the action); 

iv.  State other pertinent information and facts, including analysis of 
relevant “Douglas Factors”, relied on in making the decision;  

v.  State that the penalty promotes the efficiency of the service;  

vi.  Include the employee’s grievance or appeal rights and to whom the 
grievance or appeal should be filed and the time limits for doing so; 

vii. Include an EAP referral, if appropriate; and 

17 

 
viii. State the name and contact information of the servicing ER Specialist 
who may be contacted for clarification of rights and further assistance. 

2-3.  Employee Right to Challenge Disciplinary Actions 

Official reprimands and suspensions of 14 days or less may be grieved by non-
bargaining unit employees under the Administrative Grievance System (see 
FEMA Manual 256-3-1, Administrative Grievance System), or by bargaining unit 
employees under the negotiated grievance procedure.  

If the employee believes that the action is based on discrimination because of 
age, sex, race, religion, color, national origin, disability, genetic information, or 
sexual orientation, the employee may consult with the Office of Equal Rights. 

Employees may, as appropriate, initiate a complaint of discrimination, or file a 
grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure. However, employees may 
elect only one avenue and their election will be considered final based on which 
action is filed first. Employees may not raise complaints of discrimination under 
the Administrative Grievance System. 

2-4.  Effective Date of the Action 

A.  The effective date of the action is established by the deciding official and is 

cited in the written decision notice. 

B.  For suspensions of 14 days or less, the decision will be effected as soon as 

practicable after consideration of the employee’s reply, if any. 

C.  An application for disability retirement does not delay or prevent other 

appropriate action that may be warranted. If an employee expresses an 
interest in disability retirement, the supervisor should refer the employee to 
OCCHCO for proper guidance.

Protection Board (MSPB).    

B.  Bargaining unit employees have the right to either grieve the action in 

accordance with the negotiated grievance procedures or appeal to MSPB, but 
not both. 

C.  An employee who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel 
action in retaliation for whistleblowing may (1), if covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement (CBA), grieve the action in accordance with the CBA’s 
grievance procedures, (2) appeal to the MSPB, or (3) appeal to the Office of 
Special Counsel. However, the employee may only elect one remedy, and the 
election is based on which action the employee files first. 

25 

 
 
D.  If the employee believes that the action is based on discrimination because of 
age, sex, race, religion, color, national origin, disability, genetic information, or 
sexual orientation, the employee may consult with the Office of Equal Rights. 

E.  Employees may, as appropriate, initiate a complaint of discrimination, or file a 
grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure. However, employees 
may elect only one avenue and their election will be considered final based 
on which action is filed first. Employees may not raise complaints of 
discrimination under FEMA’s Administrative Grievance System. 

4-5.  Effective Date of the Action 

A.  The effective date of the action is established by the deciding official and is 

cited in the written decision notice. 

B.  For suspensions of 15 days or more, demotions, or removals, the effective 

date may not be earlier than 30 days from the employee’s receipt or 
constructive notice of the proposed action. Employees are entitled to a 30-day 
advance written notice period before the effective date of the action. 

C.  An application for disability retirement does not delay or prevent other 

appropriate action that may be warranted. If an employee expresses an 
interest in disability retirement, the supervisor should refer the employee to 
OCCHCO for proper guidance. 

4-6.  Furlough Procedures 

A furlough for less than 30 continuous calendar days or 22 discontinuous 
workdays is an adverse action that temporarily forces an employee into a non-
duty and non-pay status due to lack of work, lack of funds, or other non-
disciplinary reasons (furloughs for more than 30 calendar days or 22 
discontinuous workdays are reduction-in-force actions, see FM 256-2-1, 
Reduction-in-Force/Transfer of Function). OCCHCO/Labor and Employee 
Relations must be consulted before placing an employee on a furlough. The 
above procedures apply with the following additions and exceptions: 

A.  Proposal Notice. Supervisors or managers must state the basis for selecting a 
particular employee for furlough if not all employees in a given competitive 
level are being furloughed. 

B.  An advanced written notice and opportunity to answer are not required for 

furloughs without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden 
breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, lapses in appropriations (when the 
lapse is uncertain until it occurs) or sudden emergencies requiring immediate 
curtailment of activities. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE 

5-1.  Applicability 

This Chapter is applicable to employees hired under Title 5 of the United States 
Code. 

5-2.  Generally 

The use of administrative leave may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis 
when an employee’s alleged misconduct resulted in an investigation, a 
determination of unsuitability (or unfitness), suspension or revocation of a 
security clearance, or a proposed removal. When an employee is placed on 
administrative leave in connection with discipline, their access to FEMA facilities 
and information technology (IT) systems is revoked immediately. No employee 
should be placed on administrative leave without consultation with 
OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations. (See section 5-9 for the approval 
requirements when granting administrative leave.) 

5-3.  Employees Who Do Not Have a Security Clearance 

If an employee does not have a security clearance and is available for duty 
following receipt of an allegation of misconduct, arrest or indictment, or is under 
investigation for alleged misconduct, the supervisor must decide whether or not 
to place an employee on administrative leave. In consultation with 
OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations, the supervisor must consider the 
following factors: 

A.  Is there is a reasonable belief that the employee committed an offense for 

which a prison sentence may be imposed? 

B.  What is the nature of the offense? 

C.  What evidence is available related to the offense? 

D.  Was the employee arrested or indicted? 

E.  Does the known evidence suggest that the employee’s presence in FEMA 
facilities or access to FEMA IT systems constitutes a risk or direct threat? 

F.  Are there other factors that indicate that the mission will be adversely affected 

if the employee is returned to duty, such as notoriety? 

G.  If the employee’s presence in FEMA facilities is a potential threat, is the 

employee able to perform work duties from an alternate worksite, such as that 
established in an applicable telework agreement? 

27 

 
 
 
 
5-4.  Unsuitability Cases 

In unsuitability or unfitness cases, administrative leave is immediate upon notice 
from OCSO. Supervisors must work with OCCHCO/Labor and Employee 
Relations to issue the notice of administrative leave (see Chapter 8 for 
unsuitability and unfitness actions). 

5-5.  Security Clearance Cases 

An employee with a security clearance may have an affirmative duty to report to 
the OCSO when he or she has been arrested or indicted. Whenever OCSO 
discovers that an employee has been arrested or indicted, OCSO shall consider 
whether or not suspension of the clearance is appropriate. 

If an employee has a security clearance, and OCSO suspends the clearance, the 
employee may be placed on administrative leave prior to the supervisor’s 
proposal to place the employee on indefinite suspension. If OCSO restores the 
employee’s clearance, the employee may be returned to duty.   

5-6.  Removal Cases 

When a removal action is pending, a supervisor may place the employee on 
administrative leave if the supervisor believes that the employee’s continued 
presence may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or 
damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government 
interests. 

5-7.  Supervisory Responsibility and Considerations 

Prior to placing an employee on administrative leave, supervisors must consult 
with OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations. All cases involving employees on 
administrative leave should be reassessed every thirty (30) days to determine if 
the need still exists (the Administrator, or designee, must approve any period of 
administrative leave for 30 days or more). 

5-8.  Special Considerations When an Employee is Arrested 

Upon receipt of information that the employee has been arrested or indicted for a 
crime, the supervisor of record, FCO, or temporary duty supervisory, as 
applicable, shall notify OCSO of the charges or indictment, and shall contact 
OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations for guidance. 

If the employee is incarcerated or otherwise unable to come to work, the 
supervisor must address the employee’s duty status. Employees may use 
available leave, if requested and approved by the supervisor. If the request is 
denied, or if there is insufficient leave to cover the leave request, and the 
employee is not present for work, the employee shall be charged with “absence 

28 

 
 
 
   
 
without leave.” The supervisor is not obligated to approve a leave request 
submitted by the employee. In most cases, an employee is not placed on 
administrative leave when arrested or incarcerated. 

For employees who are arrested or become the subject of allegations of 
misconduct when deployed, the FCO shall make the decision as to whether the 
employee shall remain at the JFO, after consultation with the supervisor of 
record. If the supervisor of record and the FCO disagree on whether to 
demobilize the employee, the issue will be resolved by the Associate 
Administrator of Response and Recovery.  

5-9.  Approval Requirements for Administrative Leave 

The following officials have the authority to approve administrative leave: 

A.  Supervisors of record may approve up to 30 days of administrative leave; and 

B.  The Administrator, or designee, may approve more than 30 days of 

administrative leave. 

5-10.  Return to Duty 

The supervisor of record shall consult with OCCHCO/Labor and Employee 
Relations before returning an employee to duty after a period of administrative 
leave. The supervisor shall make the final decision as to whether the employee 
shall return to duty. 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
EXPEDITED PROCEDURES 

6-1.  Procedural Requirements for Probationary Employees in the Competitive 

Service 

A.  The probationary period allows supervisors the opportunity to evaluate the 
employee’s performance and conduct to determine whether the employee 
should be retained beyond the probationary period. Supervisors should 
counsel employees early regarding any performance and/or conduct issues 
so that the employee may have an opportunity to correct the problem. 
Probationary employees may receive reprimands and other appropriate 
actions, in accordance with the procedures outlined in Chapters 2 and 4 of 
this policy. An instance of serious misconduct, unacceptable performance, or 
repeated instances of minor offenses during the probationary period should 
warrant removal from Federal service. 

B.  An employee will serve a one year probationary period under the following 

circumstances: 

1.  When first appointed to a career or career conditional appointment in the 

competitive service; 

i.  From a list of eligibles; or 

ii.  After reinstatement to Federal service, unless the employee served a 
completed probationary period or served with competitive status in  a 
position which affords the basis for reinstatement; 

2.  When an employee is: 

i.  Transferred to a competitive service position when the employee is a 

career or career conditional employee of another Federal agency (see 
5 C.F.R. § 315.501); 

ii.  Promoted, demoted, or reassigned before the employee completed a 
probationary period. In such circumstances, the employee is required 
to complete a probationary period in the new position; 

iii.  Reinstated to Federal service from a Reemployment Priority List. An 

employee does not need to serve a probationary period if the 
employee is being reinstated to FEMA to a position within the same 
commuting area; or 

iv.  Appointed to the competitive service by a special appointing authority 
or by conversion under Title 5, C.F.R. Part 315 Subparts F or G.   

C.  When a supervisor decides to remove a probationary employee for 

unacceptable performance or misconduct occurring during the probationary 
period, the employee is entitled to a written decision that contains the reasons 
for the action, including a narrative summary of the conclusions reached, 
effective date of the action, and limited appeal rights. The decision will also 
include the employee’s grievance or appeal rights, where to file the grievance 
or appeal, and the time limits for filing a grievance or appeal. The removal 

30 

 
notice must be delivered to the employee before the effective date of the 
action. 

D.  When a supervisor decides to remove a probationary employee, based in 

whole or in part, on conditions arising prior to appointment, the employee is 
entitled to advance written notice stating the reasons, specifically and in 
detail, for the proposed action and a reasonable time (no less than 7 calendar 
days) to file a written answer (including affidavits). The supervisor shall 
consider the response and issue a written decision at the earliest practicable 
date. The decision shall be effective no earlier than the date of issuance to 
the employee, and shall inform the employee of the reasons for the action 
and of his or her right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board in 
accordance with part E below. 

E.  The employee has the right to appeal the removal to the Merit Systems 

Protection Board (MSPB) on the following grounds: 

1.  Allegations that the action was based on partisan political reasons or 

marital status; 

2.  When a probationary employee terminated for performance or misconduct 
during the probationary period, alleges that the removal was not effected 
in accordance with proper procedures; or 

3.  Allegations of discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin, age, or disability, but only if such an allegation is raised in addition 
to one of the issues stated in paragraph (1) or (2), above. 

6-2.  Procedural Requirements for Employees in the Career Excepted Service 

A.  This section applies to employees in the excepted service who are preference 
eligible as defined by 5 U.S.C. § 2108 and who have not completed one year 
of current continuous service in the same or similar positions, and employees 
in the excepted service who are non-preference eligible as defined by 5 
U.S.C. § 2108 and who have not completed two years of current continuous 
service in the same or similar positions under other than temporary 
appointments limited to two years or less. 

B.  Supervisors should address any performance and/or conduct issues early. 

These employees may receive reprimands or suspensions of 14 days or less 
according to the procedures in Chapter 3. An instance of serious misconduct, 
unacceptable performance, or repeated instances of minor offenses during 
the trial period should warrant removal from Federal service. 

C.  When a supervisor decides to remove an employee for unacceptable 

performance or misconduct, the employee is entitled to a written decision that 
contains the reasons for the action, including a narrative summary of the 
conclusions reached, effective date of the action, and limited appeal rights, if 
any. The removal notice must be delivered to the employee before the 
effective date of the action. 

31 

 
 
D.  Normally, the employee has no right to appeal the removal to the Merit 

Systems Protection Board (MSPB). 

6-3.  Procedural Requirements for Competitive Service Term Employees 

Term employees should be given an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable 
performance and conduct. The first year of service of a term employee is a trial 
period to determine the employee’s continued fitness for Federal service. If a 
problem occurs, supervisors should address them early so that the employee can 
have an opportunity to correct them. Employees may be reprimanded, or 
suspensions without pay may be imposed. If problems continue, removal may be 
warranted. If a decision is made to remove the employee, a written notice of 
removal should be given to the employee, explaining the reasons for the 
removal, and the effective date of the action. The notice should be delivered to 
the employee before the effective date of the action. Term employees who are 
removed during their trial period may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection 
Board under the authority of 5 C.F.R. §§ 315.804 or 805, as applicable. After an 
employee successfully completes his or her trial period, the employee will be 
subject to the discipline and adverse action procedures for competitive service 
employees (see Chapters 2 and 4). 

6-4.  Procedures for Federal Coordinating Officers 

Federal Coordinating Officers (FCO) serve in excepted service positions at the 
pleasure of the FEMA Administrator. FCOs may be suspended or removed from 
Federal service for any reason not prohibited by law. In removal actions, an FCO 
may be removed with a written notice of removal explaining the reasons for the 
removal and the effective date of the action. An FCO may not appeal a 
suspension or removal decision. 

6-5.  Procedural Requirements for Competitive Service Temporary Employees 

Temporary employees serve in short-term appointments for one year or less. 
Temporary employees do not serve a trial or probationary period. If performance 
or misconduct issues arise, a temporary employee may not be demoted or 
reassigned to a different position. In removal actions, a temporary employee may 
be removed with a written notice of removal explaining the reasons for the 
removal and the effective date of the action. A temporary employee may not 
appeal a removal decision. These procedures do not apply to employees who 
completed one year of current continuous service in a non-temporary 
appointment limited to one year or less. Such employees will be subject to the 
adverse action procedures in Chapter 4. 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
7-1.  Alternative Discipline 

ALTERNATIVE DISCIPLINE 

Alternative discipline is a non-traditional, constructive approach to addressing 
misconduct or performance issues, in lieu of a formal disciplinary or adverse 
action. This approach involves a written agreement that is developed through 
collaborative efforts of the employee (and representative, if any) and the deciding 
official working together to address the misconduct or performance issues.  

The goal of Alternative Discipline is also to encourage and assist the employee in 
making positive changes and to sustain acceptable behavior and/or performance. 
Alternative discipline is a management option, not an employee entitlement, and 
it does not establish a precedent as to how FEMA will handle misconduct or 
performance issues.    

7-2.  Criteria for Using Alternative Discipline 

A.  Alternative discipline may be used when: 

1.  An employee is served with a proposed discipline or adverse action 

notice; 

2.  Misconduct or performance problem(s) would not result in a removal 

proposal;  

3.  The employee admits and takes responsibility for the misconduct or 

performance issues;  

4.  The employee does not have a prior disciplinary issue within the last three 

years;  

5.  The deciding official and/or employee requests the use of alternative 

discipline; and 

6.  The employee agrees to waive any and all rights to file a grievance, 

appeal, or complaint in any form regarding any issues associated with the 
action. 

B.  Alternative discipline may not be used when: 

1.  Work-related issues involve criminal conduct; 

2.  Misconduct requires a statutory penalty (i.e., willful misuse of a 

government vehicle carries a mandatory penalty of a 30-calendar day 
suspension); 

3.  Alternative penalty is prohibited by law or regulation; or 

4.  The employee performed at an unacceptable level in any critical element 

on the performance plan or criteria. 

33 

 
 
 
7-3.  Procedures for Effecting Alternative Discipline 

A.  Prepare and issue a notice of proposed discipline; 

B.  Draft an Alternative Discipline Agreement, with assistance from an ER 
Specialist, which describes the work-related issue and the terms and 
conditions of the agreement; 

C.  If an agreement is reached, the agreement will be signed by the deciding 

official and the employee; and 

D.  If an agreement on alternative discipline is not reached, the deciding official 

will issue a decision on the proposed action. 

7-4.  Types of Alternative Discipline 

The types of discipline that may be imposed under this type of agreement 
include, but are not limited to: 

A.  Remedial training, as determined appropriate; 

B.  Reduced suspension; 

C.  Serving a suspension on non-duty days; 

D.  Serving a suspension in smaller pieces over the course of multiple pay 

periods to soften the financial impact; 

E.  Serving a suspension that exists only through a written agreement between 

the employee and the supervisor, with no loss of pay or duties. The 
documented suspension will constitute prior misconduct for purposes of 
progressive discipline; 

F.  Financial restitution; 

G.  Participation in the Employee Assistance Program and authorization for the 

counselor to talk to the supervisor; or 

H.  Holding a portion of the penalty in abeyance on the condition that, if there is 
additional misconduct the penalty or an increased penalty will automatically 
take effect. 

7-5.  Maintenance of an Agreement 

A copy of the agreement is maintained by the deciding official, employee, and the 
servicing ER Specialist. The agreement is not placed in the employee’s Official 
Personnel Folder.  

34 

 
 
 
 
 
PROCEDURES FOR NEGATIVE SUITABILITY AND FITNESS 

DETERMINATIONS 

8-1.  Unsuitability or Unfitness Actions 

A.  OCSO makes the determination on whether FEMA employees are suitable 

(or “fit”, for excepted service employees) for Federal service and notifies the 
employee’s supervisor of record in writing of the determination. 

B.  If OCSO determines that an employee is unsuitable or unfit for Federal 

service, OCSO will notify OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations of its 
determination at least 24 hours in advance of notifying the employee’s 
supervisor. Early notification to OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations will 
allow OCCHCO/Labor and Employee Relations to: 

1.  Prepare a draft letter to notify the employee of his or her required removal 

from physical and logical access to the worksite; and 

2.  Contact the employee’s supervisor to advise the supervisor on the 
procedure for retrieval of the employee’s government property, 
suspension of information technology access, and the process for 
escorting the employee from the workplace. 

C.  After the employee’s removal from the workplace, OCCHCO/Labor and 

Employee Relations will advise the supervisor on the appropriate disciplinary 
action applicable in accordance with the employee’s appointment type.

CHAPTER 1:   GENERAL INFORMATION 

1-1.  Purpose 

This Manual implements 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) Chapter 43, “Performance Appraisal”,  
5 C.F.R. Part 430, “Performance Management,” Subparts A and B; and Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) Human Resources Performance Management Guidance and 
Instruction issued on December 1, 2008 as the DHS Performance Appraisal System approved 
by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on February 17, 2010. These documents 
assign the responsibilities and establish the policies, procedures, and requirements for the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Employee Performance Management 
Program (EPMP).  The Program is designed to support the DHS goal of promoting and 
sustaining a high-performance culture.        

1-2.  Applicability and Scope 

Generally the Program applies to all employees and supervisors whose employment is 
expected to exceed 90-days in a consecutive 12-month period who are covered by Title 5, 
United States Code (U.S.C.) Chapter 43, “Performance Appraisal,” and DHS Human 
Resources Performance Management Guidance and Instruction.  In addition, FEMA applies 
this Manual to employees hired under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act [PL 93-288, as amended] (the Stafford Act) designated as a Cadre of 
Response Employees (CORE).  

The following individuals are excluded from coverage:  

A.  Employees who are expected to be employed for 90-days or fewer. 

B.  Presidential Appointees and others in Executive Schedules positions. 

C.  Individuals in the Senior Executive Service (SES). 

D.  Employees hired under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 

Act [PL 93-288, as amended], designated as Reservists.  

E.  Experts and Consultants appointed under 5 U.S.C. § 3109, “Employment of Experts and 

Consultants; Temporary or Intermittent.” 

F.  Employees who the FEMA Administrator elects to exclude from coverage.  Initially, this 
excludes all employees, who are not supervisors or are hired under the Federal Wage 
System, until the completion of negotiations and specifically included.   

1-3.  Supersession 

This Manual supersedes FEMA Instruction, Performance Management System for General 
Schedule and Prevailing Rate Employees, dated March 9, 1987 and FEMA Manual 3700.2, 
Employee Performance System, dated May 15, 1996, as updated August 9, 1999 and March

E.  Adequate training on the Program for executives, supervisors and employees.  

1-6.      Definitions 

A.  Acceptable Level of Competence: Performance by an employee that warrants 

advancement of the employee’s rate of basic pay to the next higher step of the grade or the 

5 

 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
next higher rate within the grade as defined in 5 C.F.R. § 531.403, “Definitions,” of the 
employee’s position subject to the requirements in 5 C.F.R. § 531.404, “Earning within-
grade increase.” To be determined to be at an acceptable level of competence, the 
employee’s most recent rating of record must be at least “Achieved Expectations.”  

B.  Appraisal: The process under which performance is reviewed and evaluated. 

C.  Appraisal Program: The specific policy, procedures, and requirements set forth in DHS 
Human Resources Performance Management Guidance and Instruction issued on 
December 1, 2008 as the DHS Performance Appraisal System approved by the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) on February 17, 2010.   

D.  Core Competencies: The measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, 
and other characteristics required by a position that have been validated and which apply 
broadly to all or many jobs within the Department. Each core competency is a critical 
element. 

E.  Critical Element: A work assignment or responsibility of such importance that Unacceptable 

performance on the element results in a determination that an employee’s overall 
performance is Unacceptable. Each core competency is a critical element. Individual 
performance goals are critical elements unless designated as team or developmental by 
the rating official in the goal title.   

F.  Developmental Performance Goal: A non-critical individual performance goal which is 

included in the employee’s performance plan to encourage and track the development and 
growth of new knowledge, skills or abilities and designated by the rating official in the goal 
title. 

G.  Element Rating Level: The performance rating level that describes an employee’s 

performance on each critical element (goal and competency) during the performance cycle. 
The 4 levels (OPM pattern E) are: 

1.  Achieved Excellence:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Excellence” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 5. 

2.  Exceeded Expectations:  The employee performed at a level between “Achieved 

Excellence” standards and the “Achieved Expectations” standards.  This equates to a 
performance level of 4. 

3.  Achieved Expectations:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Expectations” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 3. 

4.  Unacceptable:  The employee performed below the “Achieved Expectations” standards; 

corrective action is required.  This equates to a performance level of 1. 

H.  Individual Development Plan (IDP): A plan developed by the employee in conjunction with 
discussions with their supervisor that identifies an employee’s short and long-term learning 
and developmental goals. The plan contains developmental activities coupled with elective 
training, and education to acquire the competencies to meet career goals. 

I. 

Individual Performance Goals: Specific goals assigned to an employee by the supervisor 
that describe detailed results that are to be achieved and which are described in the 

6 

 
employee’s performance plan. A minimum of one goal must be assigned to an individual; 
however, three to five goals may be appropriate given the complexity and grade of the 
position. Each individual performance goal is a critical element unless defined as a 
development or team goal by the rating official in the goal title.   

J.  Interim Evaluation: A narrative description of an employee’s performance as measured 

against the performance expectations set forth in a performance plan. 

K.  Minimum Period: The 90-day period of time during which an employee must perform under 
an approved performance plan before receiving a rating of record or an interim evaluation. 

L.  Non-Critical Element: A work assignment or responsibility that is considered to be 

completed by a team or developmental in nature. A non-critical element cannot be used as 
the foundation for taking a performance-based action. Development and team performance 
goals are non-critical elements. 

M.  Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance: A reasonable chance for an 

employee whose performance has been determined to be Unacceptable in one or more 
critical elements to demonstrate acceptable performance in the critical element(s) at issue. 

N.  Performance: The accomplishment of work assignments or responsibilities. 

O.  Performance Cycle: The 12-month time period under this Program for reviewing employee 

performance (also known as an appraisal cycle or rating cycle). 

P.  Performance Expectations: The performance goals, core competencies, and associated 

performance standards set forth in an employee’s performance plan. 

Q.  Performance Goals: See subparagraph I, “Individual Performance Goals.” 

R.  Performance Plan: A written plan that describes the performance expectations (i.e., 

performance goals, core competencies, and associated performance standard(s)) that are 
to be met during the performance cycle. 

S.  Performance Standard: The management-approved expression of the performance 
threshold(s), requirement(s), or expectation(s) that must be met to be appraised at a 
particular level of performance. A performance standard may include, but is not limited to 
quality, quantity, timeliness, and manner of performance. Performance standards under the 
Program are described at the “Achieved Expectations” and “Achieved Excellence” levels. 

T.  Progress Review: A documented discussion, typically conducted on a quarterly basis, 
between an employee and the employee’s rating official about the employee’s actual 
performance as compared to the performance expectations set forth in the employee’s 
performance plan. 

U.  Rating Official: The official, generally the first-level supervisor, who prepares the 

employee’s performance plan with input from the employee, conducts progress reviews, 
and prepares any interim evaluations and the final rating of record. 

V.  Rating of Record: A written performance appraisal that is prepared at the end of the 
performance cycle, covering an employee’s performance of assigned duties against 

7 

 
performance expectations over the entire performance cycle and includes the assignment 
of a summary rating level. 

W. Reduction-in-Grade: The involuntary assignment of an employee to a position at a lower 

classification or job grading level. 

X.  Removal: The involuntary separation of an employee from employment. 

Y.  Reviewing Official: The official, generally the employee’s second-level supervisor, who 

reviews and approves the performance plan and rating of record. 

Z.  Self-Assessment: An employee’s written assessment of their own performance of assigned 

duties and responsibilities as measured against performance expectations. 

AA.  Summary Rating Level: The performance rating level that describes an employee’s 
overall performance during the performance cycle and which is a weighted calculation 
derived mathematically from an employee’s performance on both performance goals and 
core competencies. The 4-Level (OPM Pattern E) are: 

1.  Achieved Excellence:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Excellence” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 5. 

2.  Exceeded Expectations:  The employee performed at a level between “Achieved 

Excellence” standards and the “Achieved Expectations” standards.  This equates to 
a performance level of 4. 

3.  Achieved Expectations:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Expectations” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 3. 

4.  Unacceptable:  The employee performed below the “Achieved Expectations” 

standards; corrective action is required.  This equates to a performance level of 1. 

BB.  Team Performance Goal: A non-critical individual performance goal which is included in 
the employee’s performance plan to encourage and track team or group performance 
results. 

CC.  Unacceptable Performance: The failure of an employee to meet established 

performance standards in one or more critical elements of such employee’s position.

CHAPTER 2:   PROCEDURES 

2-1.    General 

FEMA Employee Performance Management Program (EPMP) performance cycle will begin on 
January 1 of each calendar year except for the Office of Chief Counsel which is on a fiscal 
year cycle, and at the beginning of an appointment, detail, or temporary promotion that is 
expected to last more than 90-days. The performance cycle will end on December 31, or as 
soon as possible thereafter and still provide the employee a minimum of 90-days under a 
performance plan following a covered appointment, detail, or temporary promotion. The 
procedures described in the following 11 sections constitute FEMA EPMP and are consistent 
DHS Human Resources Performance Management Guidance and Instruction issued on 
December 1, 2008 as the DHS Performance Appraisal System approved by the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) on February 17, 2010. 

2-2.    Performance Planning Process 

A.  Performance planning is the critical first step in a successful performance management 

process and is an essential factor to achieving and sustaining a high-performance culture. 
At the beginning of the performance cycle, a temporary promotion that is expected to last 
more than 90-days, and upon entry into a new position, a written performance plan shall be 
developed identifying the specific performance expectations for which the employee will be 
held accountable. The Program endeavors to balance the demonstration of core 
competencies and achievement of individual performance goals. 

B.  Core Competencies.  Employee performance plans will contain pre-established core 

competencies. The DHS-wide standards for the pre-established core competencies are 
written at the “achieved expectations and “achieved excellence” level based on 
occupational series and grade.  Supervisors will use these standards when evaluating 
performance on these competencies. The average rating of all the core competencies 
comprises 40% of the annual rating of record. The core competencies are: 

1.  Communications 

2.  Customer Service (except for positions in the 1811 and 1896 series) 

3.  Representing the Agency 

4.  Teamwork/Communication 

5.  Technical Proficiency  

6.  Assigning, Monitoring, and Evaluating Work (supervisors only) 

7.  Leadership (supervisors only) 

C.  Individual Performance Goals.  The performance plan of each employee will include 

individual performance goals that describe what the employee is expected to accomplish 
during the performance cycle. While rating officials should involve employees in the 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
development of their performance goals to the extent practicable, rating officials retain sole 
discretion to determine goals. Each individual performance goal must align with 
organizational goals. The individual performance goals section of the performance plan 
accounts for 60% of the annual rating of record. 

D.  Establishing Performance Standards for Individual Performance Goals.  At the time 
performance goals are identified, rating officials will establish specific performance 
standards for each goal within the employee’s span of control. While rating officials should 
involve employees in the development of their performance standards to the extent 
practicable, rating officials retain sole discretion to determine the standards associated with 
each goal (e.g., quality, quantity, timeliness, manner of performance) at the “Achieved 
Expectations” and the “Achieved Excellence” levels. These performance standards will be 
used to evaluate progress in achieving the goals. 

E.  Assigning Weights.  Once performance goals and standards have been established, rating 
officials will assign weights to each goal. How much weight is assigned to each goal is 
discretionary. In assigning weights to goals, the rating official should take into account the 
scope of the goal, the amount of time expected to be devoted to the goal, and the impact of 
the goal on organizational operations. 

F.  Employee Involvement.  Rating officials are expected to involve employees in the 

development of their performance plans insofar as practicable. Rating officials should 
obtain input from, and engage in meaningful discussions with, employees regarding 
specific performance goals and related performance standards for which they will be held 
accountable. They should also explain what their understanding is of the core 
competencies and the associated established performance standards as applicable to the 
work unit. Finally, they should inform employees of progress review(s) that will occur during 
the performance cycle. 

G.  Individual Development Plan (IDP).  IDPs contain developmental activities coupled with 

elective training, and education to acquire the competencies to meet career goals. During 
performance planning, employees are required to develop IDPs. Management retains sole 
discretion to determine the extent to which IDPs may be supported by the organization after 
considering relevant factors, such as operational requirements and budget limitations. 

H.  Changes to Performance Plans.  Rating officials may update performance plans whenever 

they determine it is appropriate. A rating official may change a plan to reflect new 
organizational goals, to update goals and standards when outside influences beyond an 
employee’s control make the original goals and standards unachievable, or to reflect new 
organizational or management priorities. Such changes are to be documented in 
performance plans and communicated to the employee. When an individual performance 
goal is no longer applicable, then the goal weight will be adjusted to give credit to the work 
completed. If an employee’s performance plan is changed within the last 90-days of the 
performance cycle, the rating official will extend the rating period to allow for the required 
90-days under the amended performance plan before the rating of record is executed. 

13 

 
I.  Communicating with Employees.  Performance expectations must be communicated to 

employees verbally and in writing before they may be held accountable for them. 

J.  Review and Approval of Performance Plans.  Before becoming final, the employee’s 

reviewing official will review and approve the performance plan. Reviewing officials may 
adjust individual performance goals, performance standards, and goal weights to ensure 
consistency with plans established for similar positions within their jurisdiction and 
conformity with organizational goals. 

K.  Timing of Performance Plans.  Rating officials will develop and submit performance plans 
to employees within 30-days after the beginning of the performance cycle, an employee's 
entrance into a covered position, or an employee's entrance into a detail or temporary 
promotion that is expected to last more than 90-days. 

L.  Addressing Special Performance Appraisals Situations. 

1.  Changes in Position (i.e., reassignment, demotion, permanent promotion).  Employees 
who are affected by a change in position will be placed on a written performance plan 
by their new supervisor that identifies performance expectations for which the 
employees will be held accountable. See Appendix A for a detailed explanation of how 
performance is evaluated when employees are affected by changes in position.   

2.  Details.  Employees who are expected to be on detail for more than 90-days will be 

provided with a performance plan by the supervisor of the detail. See Appendix A for a 
detailed explanation of how performance is evaluated while on detail. When employees 
are on details of less than 90 days or other ad hoc assignments which take them away 
from their regular duties (such as disaster assignments), proper consideration must be 
given to adjusting work expectations and supervisors should give weight to these 
assignments when evaluating performance. 

3.  Temporary Promotions.  Employees who are expected to be temporarily promoted for 
more than 90-days will be placed on a written performance plan by the temporary 
supervisor that identifies performance expectations for which the employees will be held 
accountable. See Appendix A for a detailed explanation of how performance is 
evaluated while on temporary promotion. 

4.  Changes in Supervisor.  Employees whose supervisors change will have their current 
written performance plans re-validated by the new supervisors (or the new supervisors 
may issue new performance plans). See Appendix A for a detailed explanation of how 
employee’s performance is evaluated when employees’ supervisors change. 

5.  Transfers.  See Appendix A for a detailed explanation of how performance is evaluated 

when employees transfers out of the Department of Homeland Security. 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2-3.    Progress Reviews 

A.  Rating officials must monitor employee performance continuously throughout the 

performance cycle and should talk with employees about progress, problems, and 
successes as frequently as possible.  Employees are encouraged to periodically share 
summaries of significant events and to ask for guidance or assistance whenever they are 
unable to independently find the information or resources they need. Progress reviews may 
take place at any time during the performance cycle; however are required quarterly.  

A Progress Review does the following: 

1.  Inform employees of their performance. 

2.  Documents discussions between the rating official and employee on performance. 

3.  Review of performance goals and results to date in light of individual performance 

standards and supervisor’s expectations. 

4.  Outline measures to correct any performance deficiencies or to improve performance 

that is otherwise acceptable. 

5.  Progress reviews do not include preliminary rating levels or calculate summary ratings 

of overall performance. 

B.  Recommended Progress Reviews.  Additional progress reviews may be appropriate 

whenever a rating official notices a significant change in performance.  The most obvious 
situation is when the rating official notices a downward turn in performance, especially if 
even one performance goal or core competency goes below expectations. Progress 
reviews also are appropriate when the rating official notices a marked improvement in 
performance.  This encourages excellence in performance by letting employees know when 
they are exceeding expectations. 

C.  Documentation of Progress Reviews.  Rating officials will document all progress reviews. 

The documentation will reflect that a discussion took place on the employee's performance; 
summarize the review; and any updates to the performance plan. The employee will be 
given the opportunity to review the document and comment then acknowledge receipt of 
the review in writing. 

2-4.    Self-Assessment 

Rating officials will encourage employees to complete a self-assessment of their performance 
prior to progress reviews and completion of the rating of record. Completion of a self-
assessment is voluntary on the part of the employee and supervisors may not coerce an 
employee into completing a self-assessment. The self-assessment may be documented under 
the employee’s progress review or ratings comments section in the form. 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-5.    Developing Employees 

Subject to budgetary and other organizational constraints, supervisors must provide 
employees with the proper tools and technology to do their jobs.  They must also develop 
employees to enhance their ability to perform.  Supervisors must implement formal training 
plans for employees in entry/developmental positions and for all supervisors during their first 
year of coverage under FEMA EPMP. 

2-6.    Dealing with Poor Performance 

A.  At any time during the appraisal period, if a Rating Official determines that an employee is 

performing poorly in one or more critical elements (i.e., Goals or Competencies); 
appropriate action must be taken to address the performance deficiencies as soon as 
possible. Before electing an appropriate course of action, a supervisor must consult with a 
representative from the Labor and Employee Relations (LER), Human Capital for advice, 
guidance, and to ensure proposed actions comply with applicable regulations issued in 5 
C.F.R. 432. 

1.  The supervisor should take into account all the circumstances involved, including the 

nature and gravity of the Unacceptable performance and its consequences, the extent 
to which the deficiencies may be caused by factors outside of the employee's control, 
and whether the deficiencies are based upon poor performance-and/or-misconduct. 

2.  A supervisor should consider the range of options available to address the performance 

deficiencies. Available courses of action include, but are not limited to, formal 
consultation with the employee, remedial training, an oral warning, a written warning, a 
reassignment, a proposal to reduce the employee's grade, or a proposal to remove the 
employee from Federal service. However, proposals to reduce-in-grade or remove an 
employee for Unacceptable performance under 5 C.F.R. Part 432 may be taken only 
after the employee has been given an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable 
performance, as described below except that PIPs are not required for COREs.  Certain 
categories of employees are exempt from the requirement to demonstrate acceptable 
performance as described in paragraph B including employees hired under the Stafford 
Act and probationary employees.  

3.  When an employee performs poorly, particularly on a supervisory or managerial 

competency (i.e., assigning, monitoring, and evaluating work; leadership), his or her 
manager should review previous actions taken to improve the supervisor's or manager's 
performance on these competencies. This should include review of the training (e.g., 
human resources or leadership training), coaching, or mentoring provided; actions taken 
during the supervisory probationary period or under a formal training plan; or any prior 
remedial actions that may have been taken against the supervisor for performance 
reasons. 

16 

 
 
 
 
  
B.  Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance (prior to taking an unacceptable 

performance based action under 5 C.F.R. Part 432):   

1.  When an employee’s performance is Unacceptable in one or more critical element, the 

employee shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable 
performance, commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee's 
position. 

2.  The employee will be advised in writing that unless his or her performance in the critical 

element(s) improves to and is sustained at an acceptable level; he or she may be 
reduced-in-grade or removed. 

3.  A PIP, if issued, must be in place for a minimum period of 60-days.As part of the 

employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance the employee shall be 
offered assistance in improving Unacceptable performance. Upon completion the 
opportunity to improve, the employee's performance is assessed, and a rating of record 
is issued by the supervisor. If a rating of record of Unacceptable is given after an 
opportunity to improve, then one of the following actions is required: reassignment, 
reduction-in-grade, or removal. Such action will be initiated within 30-days from 
issuance of the rating of record.  

4.  Within-grade increases will be delayed during the opportunity to improve. 

2-7.    Performance Evaluation 

A.  Completion of Ratings Record. 

1.  Annual Rating of Record.  Rating officials must complete ratings of record within 30-
days after the end of the performance cycle, except as otherwise provided in this 
program and summarized in Appendix A.  They should encourage employees to provide 
input about their performance and a self-assessment prior to completing the rating.  
Rating officials must submit their ratings of record to the reviewing officials who approve 
the ratings before the rating officials discuss the ratings with their employees.  The 
rating becomes final when issued to the employee with all appropriate reviews and 
signatures.  At this time, the annual rating of record becomes official for the purpose of 
any provision of title 5 CFR 430, for which an official rating of record is required.   

A rating official who has supervised an employee for less than 90-days may prepare the 
rating of record when he or she believes they are sufficiently familiar with the 
employee's work.  When preparing the rating of record with less than the 90-days 
experience as the employee’s supervisor, the new rating official will consider any 
relevant documents or notes from the progress reviews and consult with the previous 
rating and reviewing officials, if possible. If the rating official does not feel they are 
sufficiently familiar with the employee's work to complete a valid rating, then the process 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
should be moved up one level e.g., the reviewing official becomes the rating official and 
the third level supervisor then assumes the role of the reviewing official. 

2.  Early Rating.  A rating of record may be prepared within 90-days prior to the end of the 
performance cycle when warranted by a special circumstance (e.g., the employee is 
leaving the position for another position in the Department of Homeland Security; the 
rating official is leaving the position).  However, the employee must be on a 
performance plan for a minimum of 90-days in order to receive a rating of record. 

B.  Extension of Rating Period. The performance cycle may be extended for up to 90-days 

when warranted by a special circumstance.  Appendix A identifies rating official’s 
responsibilities under various situations. For example: if the employee has not met the 90-
day minimum rating period at the end of the performance cycle; or the rating official has not 
supervised the employee for 90-days and, for that reason, is not sufficiently familiar with the 
employee's work to prepare a rating of record. 

C.  Completion of Interim Evaluations.  An employee who:  (1) completes a detail or temporary 
promotion of more than 90-days; (2) moves to a new position or new supervisor within the 
Department of Homeland Security during the rating period; or (3) is under the supervision 
of a rating official who leaves his or her position prior to the last 90-days of the rating 
period, will receive an interim evaluation.  An interim evaluation will contain a written 
narrative describing the employee's performance and identifies an interim rating level for 
each performance goal and core competency, but does not assign a summary rating of 
overall performance.  The employee’s permanent supervisor will consider interim 
evaluations when the rating of record is prepared at the end of the performance cycle.  If an 
employee is on detail at the end of the performance cycle, an interim evaluation should be 
requested by the permanent supervisor for consideration. 

D.  Union Representatives.  Rating officials will not consider authorized official time spent by 
union representatives on representational matters when appraising their performance.  
Rather, rating officials will rate union representatives only on the time they devote to the 
performance of official FEMA duties provided the union representative is covered by a 
performance plan for at least the minimum 90-day period. 

E.  Consideration of Employee Input and Other Information.  The rating official will consider 
employee input (e.g., self-assessment) and any other information regarding performance 
(e.g., employee input on key results or major accomplishments, progress reviews, interim 
evaluations).  The rating official will also consider the performance of the work unit as a 
whole and resolve any inconsistencies between the two (e.g., the unit performance was 
poor but the employee's performance exceeds expectations). The rating official will then 
use one of four rating levels below to rate the employee's performance for each individual 
performance goal and core competency against the appropriate performance standard.  
The four rating levels are: 

18 

 
 
 
1.  Achieved Excellence:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Excellence” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 5. 

2.  Exceeded Expectations:  The employee performed at a level between “Achieved 

Excellence” standards and the “Achieved Expectations” standards.  This equates to a 
performance level of 4. 

3.  Achieved Expectations:  The employee performed as described by the “Achieved 

Expectations” standards.  This equates to a performance level of 3. 

4.  Unacceptable:  The employee performed below the “Achieved Expectations” standards; 

corrective action is required.  This equates to a performance level of 1. 

2-8.    Summary Rating 

The summary rating of an employee's overall performance is derived by using the rating levels 
assigned to each performance goal and additional core competency as follows: 

A.  Individual Performance Goals (Accounts for 60% of the overall summary rating):  The 

performance level assigned to each individual performance goal under this competency will 
be multiplied by its assigned weight.  The sum of the results of those calculations is 
multiplied by 60% (0.60) to determine the subtotal for this competency.  The subtotal is 
rounded to the nearest one-tenth (e.g., using standard rounding; 2.45 is rounded up to 2.5; 
and 2.44 is rounded to 2.4). However, if one individual performance goal is rated 
“Unacceptable”, then this competency is rated “Unacceptable” and the numerical rating is 0 
unless designated as a team or developmental goal by the rating official in the goal title.  

B.  Core Competencies (Accounts for 40% of the overall summary rating):  The performance 
level assigned to the core competencies will be totaled and then divided by the number of 
competencies to arrive at an average score.  The average is multiplied by 40% (0.40) to 
determine the subtotal for these competencies.  The total will be rounded to the nearest 
one-tenth as described in subparagraph (1) above.   

The two subtotal ratings will be added together to obtain the overall summary rating. This 
numeric rating is converted into one of the four summary rating levels as shown below.  A 
written justification is required to support all summary ratings.  Each core competency is a 
critical element. Individual performance goals are critical unless designated as team or 
developmental by the rating official in the goal title.  If one or more critical element is rated 
as "Unacceptable," then the summary rating must be "Unacceptable."  

C.  The summary rating is calculated using the following scale: 

1.  4.5 or higher, the summary rating is “Achieved Excellence.” 

2.  3.5-4.4, the summary rating is “Exceeded Expectations.” 

3.  2.5-3.4, the summary rating is “Achieved Expectations.” 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  Less than 2.5, the summary rating is “Unacceptable.” 

Forced distributions of ratings and/or quotas for ratings are not permitted at any rating level.  
This prohibition does not prevent management officials from making distinctions among 
employees or groups of employees based on performance for other purposes (e.g., for 
award determinations). 

D.  FEMA management officials may not lower the rating of record of an employee due to an 
approved absence from work.  This includes the absence of a disabled veteran to seek 
medical treatment as provided in Executive Order 5396. 

2-9.    Rating of Record Disputes 

Employees are encouraged to informally resolve concerns over their ratings of record with their 
rating and reviewing officials.  Supervisors are expected to engage in open and constructive 
dialogue with employees about performance and to prevent and resolve workplace disputes.  If 
the concerns remain unresolved, employees may pursue them through the appropriate dispute 
resolution processes.  

Bargaining unit employees may grieve a rating of record through a negotiated grievance 
procedure where an applicable procedure exists and covers such grievances.  Bargaining unit 
employees should refer to their negotiated agreement for the applicable grievance procedures. 

A non-bargaining unit employee may grieve a rating of record using FEMA’s Administrative 
Grievance System. 

A FEMA employee may use the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint process in 
29 CFR 1614, if he or she believes the performance rating of record is based on unlawful 
discrimination and/or harassment. 

An employee or supervisor may utilize the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process, 
which provides supervisors and employees the resources to support collaboration and resolve 
differences. 

2-10.    Transfer of Rating 

According to OPM’s, “Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping and the National Archives General 
Records Schedules,” the three most recent ratings of record within the last 4 years will transfer 
when an employee is reassigned. Performance records transferred from a previous employer 
may be filed with records created by the Agency. 

2-11.    Performance Related Personnel Actions 

The governing applicable laws, regulations, and department and agency directives provide for 
ratings of record to be used as a basis for taking appropriate personnel actions. 

Ratings of record will be used as a basis for making: 

20 

 
A.  Within-grade increase determinations under 5 CFR part 531, subpart D, “Within-Grade 
Increases,” or quality step increases under 5 CFR part 531, subpart E, “Quality Step 
Increase” (for example: for a within-grade increase, an employee's most recent rating of 
record must be at least “Achieved Expectations;” and for a quality step increase, an 
employee's most recent rating of record must be at least “Achieved Excellence;” and 

B.  A pay determination under any other applicable law or regulation consistent with governing 

the Department of Homeland Security Management Directives and policies. 

C.  Reduction-in-force.  Ratings of record will be used during reductions-in-force as provided in 

5 CFR Part 351. 

D.  Promotions.  Ratings of record will be used in promotions consistent with governing laws 

and regulations and negotiated agreements. 

E.  Other Purposes.  Ratings of record will be used for other purposes consistent with 
governing laws, regulations, Department and Agency directives, and negotiated 
agreements. 

2-12.    Awards  

Ratings of record may be used as a basis for determining whether to grant an award under  
5 U.S.C. chapter 45, 5 CFR Part 451, and Department and Agency directives.

  Policy 

A.  It is in the interest of the employee and supervisor to resolve grievances at 

the lowest level possible. The employees and supervisors should consider a 
grievance as a mutual problem and work together toward a satisfactory 
resolution. Mutual and satisfactory resolution works best when: the grievant 
and representative focus on describing the concern(s) and satisfactory 
remedies; the supervisor focuses on providing a full explanation and a fair, 
creative, and prompt resolution; and all parties focus on the issues and avoid 
personal recriminations and accusations of bad faith. 

B.  This Manual endorses the importance of promptly recognizing, preventing, 
and/or resolving employment-related disputes, and treating all employees 
reasonably and fairly. It is FEMA policy to ensure: 

1.  Freedom from Adverse Impact. An employee’s initiation of a grievance in 

good faith : 

a.  Is permitted without restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or 

reprisal. 

b.  Will not adversely impact his/her standing with the supervisor or call 

into question the employee’s loyalty or importance to FEMA.   

c.  Will not reflect negatively on the employee’s supervisor or on FEMA 

management.  

2.  Informal Resolution When Possible. Supervisors and managers will strive 

to resolve grievances informally and at the lowest level possible. 

5 

 
 
3.  Employee Rights. 

a.  Right to Present a Grievance.   

b.  Right to Representation. An employee may present a grievance with or 
without representation. A grievant may be advised, represented, and 
accompanied by a representative of his or her choice who is a willing 
participant. FEMA management may disallow a chosen representative 
if the particular individual would: 

i.  Result in a conflict of interest or position;  

ii.  Conflict with a priority need of FEMA or the Government; or 

iii.  Result in unreasonable cost.  

4.  Right to Official Time to Prepare and Present a Grievance. The grievant 

and representative, if otherwise in an active duty status and with the prior 
approval of his/her respective supervisor, are allowed a reasonable 
amount of official time to prepare and present a grievance. 

5.  Right to Payment of Reasonable Expenses. The salary for any employee 
participating in a grievance as a grievant, representative, fact finder, 
witness, etc., will be paid in the same manner as if the employee were on 
a regular work assignment, provided the use of official time is authorized 
and approved in advance by the employee’s supervisor. Overtime work 
may not be approved for this purpose. Travel, per diem, contract services, 
and other expenses directly related to fact finding may be paid when 
reasonable and approved in advance by the Chief of Employee Relations.  

6.  Right to Communicate. The grievant and representative may communicate 
with and seek advice or information from appropriate sources, including 
the Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO), and 
a supervisor or management official with knowledge or information 
relevant to the grievance. This communication may be by telephone, 
email, letter, or in person, by appointment. The grievant and his/her 
representative may use existing agency communications facilities (e.g., 
mail, telephone and email). The grievant is responsible for other costs 
incurred unless approved in advance by the Chief of Employee Relations.  

1-6.

  Definitions 

A.  Administrative Grievance. An employee’s dissatisfaction or dispute in the 

workplace for which there is no other form of review within or outside FEMA.  
One employee (or a group of employees acting as individuals) may submit a 
written request for personal relief in a matter of concern or dissatisfaction 
relating to the employee’s employment that is subject to the control of FEMA 
management and not excluded by 1-2.B.2 above or by an applicable statute 
or regulation.   

B.  Day. Means calendar day. When counting days, day one is the first calendar 
day following the act or occurrence; for example, the receipt of the grievance, 
the receipt of a decision, etc. 

6

Relations and notify the grievant and representative, if any, whether a Fact 
Finder has been requested.  

2.  If a Fact Finder is appointed, the Deciding Official shall render a decision 
within 20 days after receipt of the Fact Finder’s report. The Deciding 
Official shall review the grievance, Fact Finder’s report, and grievant’s 
comments, if any. The Deciding Official may choose to meet with the 
grievant and or their representative during this period.  

3.  If a Fact Finder is not appointed, the Deciding Official shall render a 

decision within 60 days after receiving the grievance. The Deciding Official

and binding on FEMA and the grievant. The decision shall be sent to the 
grievant and representative, if any, the grievant’s supervisor or 
responsible management official, and the Chief of Employee Relations. 

5.  Within five days after submitting the written decision, send the signed 
response to Employee Relations to be placed with the grievance 
documentation.    

E.  Fact Finding Process 

1.  The Fact Finder's goal is to determine impartially the facts of the case as 
simply and as directly as circumstances will allow and submit a report to 
the Deciding Official. Personal interviews and group meetings may be 
recorded by the Fact Finder for the purpose of preparing a summary.  

2.  The Chief of Employee Relations will appoint a Fact Finder (usually a 

FEMA supervisor or management official) who has not been involved in 
the issue being grieved and does not occupy a position subordinate to any 
official who recommended, advised, made a decision on, or otherwise is 
or was involved in the matter being grieved, unless that official is the 
Administrator of FEMA.   

3.  The Fact Finder will conduct an inquiry of a nature and scope appropriate 
to the issues involved in the grievance. The inquiry will be restricted to the 
issues raised in the written grievance and the personal relief requested.  
The grievant may not raise additional issues or revise the relief requested 
during the course of the grievance. The inquiry shall be conducted as 
informally as possible consistent with obtaining the facts. The inquiry may 
involve, but is not limited to, review and/or securing of documentary 

11 

 
 
evidence (relevant laws, Executive Orders, regulations, directives, 
manuals, instructions, guidance, etc.) and personal interviews or group 
meetings. Generally, the Fact Finder will meet with the grievant and/or 
grievant’s representative, listen to their presentation, and receive any 
additional documents offered. If a personal meeting and presentation is 
impractical, because of distance or other reasons, the Fact Finder may 
solicit information by other means.   

4.  Within 25 days of receiving the grievance, the Fact Finder shall:  

a.  Conduct an inquiry, if needed, to clarify the issue(s) and determine all 

facts relevant to the grievance. At his/her discretion, this inquiry usually 
consists of obtaining and summarizing relevant documentary evidence 
and conducting personal interviews and/or group meetings. However, 
the Fact Finder may submit questions in writing and request written 
replies, or use any other research or investigative techniques he or she 
deems necessary and appropriate. 

b.  Prepare and submit a Fact Finder’s Report to the Deciding Official and 
the grievant and representative, if any. This report will identify and 
summarize all facts relevant to the issue(s) of concern. 

5.  Upon written request to Employee Relations, the Fact Finder’s time-limit 
may be extended to accommodate unusual circumstances or deal with 
unusually complex issues. 

6.  Within 10 days after receiving a Fact Finder’s Report, the grievant or 

representative, if any, may submit comments on the report to the Deciding 
Official.   

12 

 
   
 
 
 
3-1.

  Cancellation of Grievances 

CHAPTER 3 - 

SPECIAL ISSUES 

The Chief of Employee Relations will cancel a grievance under any of the 
following circumstances: 

A.  At the grievant’s request. 

B.  Upon termination of the grievant’s employment with FEMA, unless the 

personal relief sought by the employee may be granted after termination of 
the employment.  

C.  Upon the death of the grievant, unless the grievance involves a question of 

pay. 

D.  For the grievant’s failure to furnish necessary information or comply with the 

grievance system timeframes and procedures. 

3-2.

  Allegations of Employment Discrimination 

If an allegation of unlawful discrimination is made in connection with a grievance, 
the allegation must be referred for processing in accordance with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation Title 29 C.F.R. Part 
1614. The grievance process will not address issues related to the allegation of 
discrimination, including unlawful employment discrimination, based on race, 
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, and reprisal. Employees 
covered by a collective bargaining agreement must follow the procedures within 
the agreement for processing discrimination complaints. 

3-3.

  Group Grievances 

A group of employees with a common complaint may present a grievance under 
the provisions of this policy. One person must be identified by the group as its 
representative so the grievance can be handled efficiently and expeditiously. If 
employees in the group have different supervisors, the Chief of Employee 
Relations may identify the supervisor or management official to whom the group 
representative first presents the grievance. Grievances submitted under the 
formal procedures, whether submitted by employees individually or as a group, 
may be considered by the same Deciding Official as a single package. 

3-4.

  Disallowance of a Grievant’s Choice of Representative 

A.  The Chief of Employee Relations may disallow a grievant’s choice of 

representative for any of the following reasons: 

1.  Priority Need of the Government. When a designated representative's 

supervisor believes the official time requested to serve as the grievant's 
representative will negatively impact the organization’s ability to: meet 
program goals in a significant way; provide required or emergency 
services; or meet critical project deadlines. 

2.  Conflict of Position. When a designated representative's supervisor 

believes the normal duties of the representative's position may require the 

13 

 
 
representative to review, recommend, prepare, or otherwise assist in the 
preparation of management's response to the grievance.  

3.  Conflict of Interest. When the grievant's supervisor believes the normal 
duties of the grievant's position may require the grievant to act for 
management in official dealings with the representative.  

4.  Unreasonable Cost to the Government. When the designated 

representative's supervisor believes authorization of official time would 
involve substantial travel costs or other related expenses. 

B.  Initiation of a Disallowance Action. A supervisor or manager in the line of 
supervision over the representative or grievant may submit a request for 
disallowance to the Chief of Employee Relations. This request will describe 
briefly the reason(s) for requesting disallowance. This request should be 
made promptly, but may be made at any time during the processing of a 
grievance. 

C.  Notification of Disallowance. The Chief of Employee Relations will notify the 
grievant in writing by sending a disallowance decision that clearly describes 
the reason(s) for disallowance. 

D.  Challenging a Disallowance Decision. The grievant may challenge a 

disallowance decision by sending an appeal to the Chief Component Human 
Capital Officer or designee, OCCHCO, within seven days after receiving the 
disallowance decision. The appeal will include the following: 

1.  A copy of the disallowance decision.  

2.  All reasons in support of reversing the disallowance decision. 

E.  Effect of a Disallowance on Grievance Processing. A disallowance decision 
suspends the time limit for seven days or until the grievant receives the final 
decision on a challenge. In addition, if the disallowance is sustained, the time 
limit is extended for up to seven more days so the grievant may obtain 
another representative.

Foreword 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to achieve business and 
management excellence by providing guidance and policy direction for the 
administration of FEMA’s Cadre of On-call Response/Recovery Employees (COREs). 
FEMA’s most valuable resource is its workforce; permanent and temporary employees 
who are focused on and committed to leading America to prepare for, prevent, respond 
to, and recover from all-hazards incidents. FEMA relies upon its temporary personnel, in 
particular, to carry out its role in incident management and support operations and to 
augment FEMA’s permanent workforce.   

The objective of the CORE Program is to attract and maintain a pool of highly skilled 
and motivated temporary personnel who are well trained and ready to respond and 
deliver quality and timely services to survivors and communities impacted by all-hazards 
incidents. The publication of this Manual will ensure consistent policy application and 
enable FEMA to better manage COREs in a cost effective and efficient manner, while 
offering the necessary incentives to recruit a professional incident workforce capable of 
assisting disaster survivors in their time of greatest need.

1-5.  Policy 

A.  The authority provided by the Stafford Act allows FEMA to manage its CORE 
Program without being required to apply all of the provisions of Title 5, United 
States Code, and its implementing regulations. FEMA chooses, as a matter of 
policy, to administratively implement some Title 5 provisions and, in other 
circumstances, to use its Stafford Act authority to create and administer its 
own policies to more effectively manage Stafford Act employees consistent 
with the intent and program needs for these positions. In all circumstances, 
FEMA intends to develop and implement policies that are fair and equitable to 
its CORE workforce and that are consistently understood and implemented by 
FEMA managers and supervisors. 

B.  COREs are hired to directly support the response and recovery efforts related 

to disasters and are funded out of the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). As 
temporary employees, COREs cannot replace the work performed and 
funded through annual appropriations by permanent full-time staff. COREs 
can perform Stafford Act duties that are not otherwise funded in FEMA’s 
budget and can be charged to an open disaster. The use of COREs must be 
reviewed and validated on a recurring basis to ensure a continued need for 
the positions and consistent funding decisions across FEMA. 

C.  FEMA shall: 

1.  Staff positions with the best qualified persons available; 

2.  Develop and use COREs to the maximum extent possible consistent with 

the completion of FEMA’s mission and the Stafford Act; 

3.  Establish CORE positions with a minimum of two-year appointments 
(unless otherwise justified for less than two years based on workload 
analyses) based on requests from Offices and Directorates authorized to 
fill CORE positions. Offices and Directorates will request the renewal of a 
CORE’s appointment prior to the CORE’s expiration date, subject to 
funding (see section 3-9); 

4.  Require COREs to sign a Conditions of Employment letter at the time of 

hiring and reappointment; 

5.  Ensure that all personnel actions are taken without regard to political, 

religious, or labor organization affiliation or non-affiliation, marital or family 
status, race, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, 
genetic information, age, or prior Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
activity; without regard to criteria unrelated to the position, such as 
personal friendship or patronage, and that selections are based solely on 
job-related criteria; and do not fall within prohibited personnel practices 
identified at 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b);  

9 

 
 
6.  Establish a pay system that will improve the ability of FEMA to attract and 

retain quality candidates and employees; 

7.  Ensure that equal pay is provided for work of equal value, with appropriate 
consideration of both national and local pay rates paid by employers in the 
private sector, and that appropriate incentives and recognition should be 
provided for excellence in performance; and 

8.  Provide effective education and training, consistent with Stafford Act 
duties, which will result in enhanced organizational and individual 
performance. 

D.  COREs must: 

1.  Maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public 

interest; and 

2.  Be prepared at all times to deploy or work from alternate work locations 

other than their normal official duty station. 

E.  COREs may be terminated at any time, with cause (poor performance or 

misconduct), or without cause (such as when workload or funding diminishes 
or ends). 

F.  A CORE may be subject to removal if the CORE declines a deployment 

request without reasonable cause. 

1-6.  Definitions 

A.  Algorithm. A formula for allocating a CORE’s salary and benefits across 

multiple disaster declarations. The allocation should correlate to the estimated 
amount of time the CORE performs work attributable to each declaration. 

B.  Annual Direct Charge CORE Certification. The annual process for verification 
of Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) related duties and the continued need for all 
CORE positions.   

C.  Appointment. A personnel action that results in an individual becoming a 
FEMA employee. Individuals, who accept CORE positions, are given 
excepted service appointments with FEMA under the Stafford Act. Generally, 
appointments may not be effective prior to the date of approval by the 
appointing official and are only effective from the date of acceptance of the 
offer of employment and entrance on duty, unless a later date is stated on the 
SF-52, or other approving document. 

D.  Ancillary Support. Personnel directly supporting disaster operations from their 

daily duty station. 

E.  Backfill. Hiring an employee to fill a previously approved vacant funded 

position. 

F.  Basic pay. The rate of pay fixed by administrative action for the position held 
before any deductions, but exclusive of additional pay of any other kind, 
including premium pay. 

10 

 
 
G.  Career path. A progression of positions in one or more occupational series 

leading to an increase in responsibility and proficiency. 

H.  Confidential Financial Disclosure (OGE Form 450) Filer. A CORE who, 

because of the duties of his or her assigned position, must file confidential 
financial disclosure reports (OGE Form 450s) as directed by the Office of 
Government Ethics and FEMA’s Office of the Chief Counsel pursuant to 5 
C.F.R. § 2634 Subpart I. COREs in these positions are assigned FEMA 
duties that involve the exercise of significant discretion in certain sensitive 
areas. OGE Form 450 disclosures serve to ensure confidence in the integrity 
of FEMA operations by identifying and preventing potential conflicts of 
interest. If a CORE’s position description indicates duties requiring a 
confidential financial disclosure, timely filing of OGE Form 450 is a condition 
of employment. 

I.  Continuing Service Agreement (CSA). A written agreement between FEMA 

and a CORE under which the CORE agrees to a specified period of 
employment with FEMA in return for a monetary incentive or participation in a 
training or developmental program. 

J.  Conversion Action. The process by which a non-CORE FEMA employee is 

appointed to a CORE position.  

K.  CORE-I (IMAT CORE). A CORE assigned full-time to an IMAT and to an 

IMAT position description. CORE-Is receive four-year appointments and are 
the first FEMA personnel deployed to an incident, serving in leadership roles 
as part of an IMAT. When not deployed, IMAT CORE base salaries are paid 
from the Disaster Readiness and Support (DRS) account; however, when 
deployed their salaries are paid by the disaster (under the declaration). IMAT 
COREs are non-direct charge COREs and new, backfill, or reassignment 
actions are not subject to direct charge CORE requirements. 

L.  Declaration. Declarations for DRF-funded events, including major disasters, 

emergencies, fire management declarations, and disasters under the 
Compact of Free Association. 

M.  Demotion. A change to a lower grade or pay band and a decrease in pay as a 

result of an adverse action or poor performance.  

N.  Direct Charge CORE. Employees whose primary duty is to carry out Stafford 

Act functions in support of open, active declarations or pre-event surge 
activities to an event for which a declaration is reasonably likely and 
imminent. The salary of a Direct Charge CORE is charged to Major Disasters, 
Emergencies, Fire Management Assistance Grants or the Disaster Surge 
account. Direct Charge COREs working on specific events should charge 
their time directly to those events. Direct Charge COREs working on multiple 
events or working as a part of a distributed group defined below should 
charge their time to an algorithm that accurately reflects the amount of work 
performed for each of those events. Specifically, the salary of a Direct Charge 
CORE may be structured in one of the following ways: 

11 

 
1.  Specific Declaration: Salary is based on work performed on a single, 

specific declaration.  

2.  Multiple Declarations: Salary is based on work that provides services to 
multiple declarations and is charged based on an established algorithm.  

3.  Distributed Group Activities: Activities comprised of non-segregable 

declaration and non-declaration related functions that will be performed 
collectively by COREs and non-COREs. The number of COREs carrying 
out a particular Distributed Group Activity is based on the percentage of 
time required for the disaster related functions of that Distributed Group 
Activity. Charges are allocated across multiple disasters based on an 
established algorithm for the Distributed Group Activity.1  

Duties related to preparedness, readiness, and planning for future events are 
not allowable Direct Charge CORE duties. Charging a CORE’s salary to 
declarations when the duties performed by the CORE do not support those 
declarations could result in a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) and 
result in adverse actions against the responsible officials. 

O.  Distributed Group Activity Baseline. The ratio of COREs and non-COREs 
carrying out a particular Distributed Group Activity as determined by the 
percentage declaration and non-declaration functions performed for that 
Activity based on verifiable workload data and evaluation of current or past 
budget justification materials. 

P.  FEMA Qualification System (FQS). A performance-based system for 

certifying FEMA employees as “Qualified” or “Trainee” in IM and IS positions; 
certification is based on successful completion of required experience, 
required training, and demonstrated performance (see FEMA Directive 010-9, 
Incident Workforce Cadre Management, dated June 9, 2014). 

Q.  Fitness Determination. “Fitness” means “the level of character and conduct 
determined for an individual to perform work for or on behalf of a Federal 
agency as an employee in the excepted service (other than a position subject 
to suitability) or as a contractor employee.” Executive Order 13,488, § 2(d); 
implemented in DHS Instruction 121-01-007, Chapter 3. 

R.  IM CORE. A CORE assigned to a two-year appointment and whose primary 
job duty is to perform an FQS incident management position. When not 
deployed, IM CORE base salaries are paid from the Disaster Readiness and 
Support (DRS) account; however, when deployed their salaries are paid by 
the disaster (under the declaration). IM COREs are non-direct charge COREs 

1 For example, OCFO’s FEMA Finance Center has a Distributed Group Activity that processes and pays invoices 
related to both disaster and non-disaster activities. Determining the number of CORE positions that should populate 
this Distributed Group Activity requires an analysis of the ratio of disaster functions versus non-disaster functions. If 
the analysis concludes that 70% of the functions are disaster related and the entire Distributed Group Activity 
requires 10 positions, then the analysis would justify 7 CORE positions out of the 10 needed to perform those 
functions. 

12 

 
                                                           
and new, backfill, or reassignment actions are not subject to direct charge 
CORE requirements 

S.  Incident Management (IM). The incident-level operation of the Federal role in 
emergency response, recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities 
include the direct control and employment of resources, management of 
incident offices, operations, and delivery of Federal assistance through all 
phases of response and recovery. 

T.  Incident Support (IS). The coordination of all Federal resources that support 
emergency response, recovery, logistics, and mitigation. Responsibilities 
include the deployment of national-level assets, support of national objectives 
and programs affected during the disaster, and support of incident operations 
with resources, expertise, information, and guidance. 

U.  Locality Payment. A locality-based comparability payment (see 5 U.S.C. § 

5304 and 5 C.F.R. Part 531, subpart F). 

V.  Mission Essential. Personnel who perform a limited set of FEMA functions 
that must be continued throughout, or resumed rapidly after, a disruption of 
normal activities. 

W. Non-Direct Charge CORE. COREs whose salaries are partially or wholly 
funded by the DRS account within the DRF. These employees’ functions 
support operational readiness, response, and recovery functions of the 
Stafford Act that are not directly attributable to the response and recovery 
efforts of any specific declaration or pre-event surge activities to an event for 
which a declaration is reasonably likely and imminent. Examples of Non-
Direct Charge COREs include IM and IMAT COREs when not deployed or 
working for an open disaster.

CHAPTER 2:  RECRUITMENT AND HIRING 

2-1.  General 

A.  FEMA Offices and Directorates will identify the Selecting Official for each hire. 

B.  FEMA Offices and Directorates may elect to recruit and hire candidates via a 
vacancy announcement as specified in section 2-4, or via a name request 
pursuant to section 2-5. FEMA maintains the flexibility to use alternative hiring 
procedures not specified in this Chapter when necessary to meet its mission 
requirements. 

C.  Nepotism is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. § 3110 and is also a “prohibited personnel 
practice” under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(7). Under 5 U.S.C. § 3110, a public official 
is prohibited from appointing, employing, promoting, advancing, or advocating 
for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement of a relative in or to 
a civilian position in FEMA in which the public official is serving or over which 
the public official exercises jurisdiction or control of any individual who is a 
relative of the public official. Upon determining that a minimally qualified 
candidate is a relative or the relative of the Selecting Official, or of someone 
in the chain of command of the Selecting Official, the program office must 
refrain from taking action on the job vacancy and contact the servicing HR 
Specialist for guidance. Supervision of a relative is not generally considered 
to be “nepotism” but is prohibited as it presents an apparent conflict of 
interest. Supervision of employees with whom the supervisor has a “covered 
relationship” may also be an apparent conflict of interest (see 5 C.F.R. § 
2635.502). 

2-2.  Staffing Plans 

A.  Offices and Directorates authorized to fill CORE positions will conduct 
workload analyses every three years, or earlier if needed based on 
operational changes, to forecast and plan for future work and skills 
requirements based on historical data, technical estimates, directed 
requirements, and approved staffing models.  

1.  The workload analysis will first identify all activities performed by each 

position (e.g., PFT, CORE, and Reservist) within an Office or Directorate, 
and designate current and planned future activities.  

2.  The analysis will estimate how frequent the activity is performed, and the 
amount of time an employee will need to complete each of the identified 
activities for which a Distributed Group Activity Baseline has not been 
approved or is being modified. 

3.  The analysis may identify shortages or overages in current staffing needs, 
which will be documented and maintained by the Offices and Directorates 
until superseded by a subsequent workload analysis or other staffing 
initiative.  

25 

 
 
B.  Based on the workload analysis, Offices and Directorates requesting CORE 

positions will develop and submit staffing plans, subject to funding, to 
OCCHCO with the number of CORE positions by title, series, grade, and duty 
station.  

1.  OCCHCO will review the entity’s requested number of CORE positions 

and proposed length of appointment based on the workload analysis and 
staffing plan.  

2.  Upon OCCHCO’s review and approval of the staffing plan, OCCHCO will 
submit the plans to OCFO for approval if the plan includes a non-Direct 
Charge CORE, or a Distributed Group Activity Direct Charge CORE if the 
distributed group activity baseline has not been approved or has changed 
since the last approval. 

3.  Upon any needed confirmation from OCFO, OCCHCO will authorize an 

Office or Directorate to create or renew a set number of CORE Positions. 

4.  The Associate Administrator for Mission Support will review and resolve 
any disputes between an Office or Directorate and OCCHCO regarding 
the approval of a workload analysis or staffing plan.   

C.  Any request to add, move, rightsize, or adjust a CORE position (if rightsizing 
a position, see Chapter 12, Rightsizing) made between workload analysis 
cycles or that does not align with the current staffing plan must be submitted 
by the head of the Office or Directorate and will require a reexamination of the 
most recent workload analysis to determine whether the identified shortages 
or additional work exists to justify the requested position, its length, and pay 
band or grade. Upon OCCHCO’s review and approval of the staffing plan, 
OCCHCO will submit the plans to OCFO for approval if the plan includes a 
non-Direct Charge CORE, or a Distributed Group Activity Direct Charge 
CORE if the distributed group activity baseline has not been approved or has 
changed since the last approval. 

D.  Duty stations for COREs will be established by the supervisor of record in 

conjunction with OCCHCO. 

2-3.  Annual Direct Charge CORE Certification 

A.  An Annual Direct Charge CORE certification, validating and verifying the 

CORE’s performance of DRF related duties and the continued need for all 
CORE positions (which have not been requested or funded elsewhere in 
FEMA’s budget), is required by the Assistant Administrator, Associate 
Administrator, Regional Administrator, and any FEMA employee reporting 
directly to the Administrator. 

B.  CORE positions must be used to execute functions or activities funded solely 

by the DRF or DRS account and are not charged elsewhere in FEMA’s 
budget. COREs may be used to administer support to FEMA’s non-
permanent workforce hired under the Stafford Act, performing duties 
including, but not limited to, hiring and staffing, training and development, 

26 

 
 
personnel and payroll processing, legal support, developing and 
implementing disaster policies and decisions, supervising Stafford Act 
employees, maintaining information technology and telecommunications 
services for Stafford Act employees or events, financial management, 
property and facility management, and auditing and program oversight. 
OCFO and OCC will provide Directorates and Offices with supplemental 
guidance on the proper use of CORE positions as needed. 

C.  Offices and Directorates must also electronically maintain documentation 
supporting the creation, backfilling or reassignment of CORE positions. 
Offices and Directorates will maintain workload analyses, position 
justifications, and staffing plans. The electronic files2 are also subject to 
independent post-action compliance review by OCFO and/or OCCHCO.   

D.  Documentation requirements for “Direct Charge” COREs  

1. Comprehensive list of all COREs to include position title, area assigned, 

branch/office, duty station, grade, PIN, and CORE type.  

2. Algorithm(s), to include methodology and frequency of analysis, used to 

determine allocation of salary costs to open active disasters. 

3. A description of duties for each position or group of positions performing 
the same work that validates the relationship of work being performed to 
open, active disasters. Example: This Public Assistance (PA) Specialist 
will: (1) be responsible for the closeout of project worksheets, (2) deploy to 
disasters to support the development and obligation of PA projects, and (3) 
conduct eligibility review of public assistance projects.  

4. Baselines and supporting documentation for establishing the baselines for 

Distributed Activity Group “Direct-Charge” COREs.  

5. Documentation shall be maintained on OCFO’s SharePoint (see footnote 
2) and shall be made available to the OCFO and/or OCCHCO for review. 
Files must be maintained in accordance with the most current DHS records 
retention policy. 

2-4.  Procedures for Soliciting Candidates 

FEMA uses the procedures listed below to hire qualified candidates for CORE 
appointments unless a name request procedure is used (see section 2-5). 

A.  To advertise a CORE position, an Office or Directorate shall submit a 

Standard Form (SF-52) to OCCHCO with a position description. If desired, 
the Office or Directorate may also submit a draft vacancy announcement or 
instead, request that OCCHCO draft it. Additionally, the Office or Directorate 
may, but is not required to, submit a specialized experience statement and 
any assessment screen-out questions that should be included in the 
announcement for the purpose of screening out applicants who are not

documentation, the HR Specialist prepares (or reviews, if submitted) the 
Vacancy Announcement and sends the draft to the Office or Directorate for 
final approval. 

B.  The Office or Directorate, in consultation with the HR Specialist, may search 
for qualified candidates utilizing one or more of the following recruitment 
sources: 

1.  An email to all FEMA employees, FEMA employees who reside in a 

specific geographic area, or FEMA employees who already work in the 
Office or Directorate advertising the position; 

2.  Electronic posting on OPM’s USAJOBS website (https://usajobs.gov); 

3.  Outside sources, including but not limited to, other Federal agencies, state 

employment services, state and local emergency management 
organizations, professional societies, minority organizations, local

E.  Vacancy Announcements that are restricted to a particular geographical area 
or to FEMA employees will clearly identify any such restrictions and indicate 
that non-compliant applications will not receive consideration. 

F.  Once the Office or Directorate has approved the vacancy announcement, the 
Staffing HR Specialist posts the vacancy announcement via the sources 
previously agreed upon and notifies the Office or Directorate that the position 
has been posted. 

G.  Vacancy announcements shall be posted for a minimum of five days. If 
requested, OCCHCO may approve a shorter posting for good cause. 

H.  Minimum qualifications: Normally, OCCHCO reviews all submitted 

applications to ensure that applications have met the minimum qualifications 
and eligibility requirements and then refers all candidates deemed minimally 
qualified to the Selecting Official via a Certificate of Eligibles (CERT). 
Selecting Officials may request to receive all applications prior to OCCHCO’s 
review, in which case OCCHCO will conduct its review prior to issuance of 
any offer. Final qualification determinations are made by OCCHCO. 

I.  After a selection is made, the Selecting Official shall provide all selection 

documentation to OCCHCO for retention in accordance with A and B above 
(see section 3-9). The Selecting Official will indicate the action taken 
(selection, non-selection, declination, etc.) on each CERT and will return the 
CERT to the HR Specialist by the expiration date of the CERT, unless an 
extension is authorized by OCCHCO. 

29 

 
2-5.  Name Request 

A.  In lieu of utilizing the hiring procedures specified in section 2-4, Offices and 
Directorates may hire qualified candidates (eligible U.S. citizens, current 
Federal employees, or current FEMA COREs) via a name request to meet a 
hiring need or to promote a CORE to a grade outside of the CORE’s current 
position ladder. Such a promotion must include the same justification and

the basic qualifications for the position and promptly notify the Selecting 
Official if the applicant is not minimally qualified. 

F.  Name request hiring actions must follow the interview, reference check, and 

job offer procedures outlined below. 

2-6. 

Interviews 

Interviews are conducted for candidates referred to the supervisor as a means of 
obtaining supplemental information on their qualifications. 

A.  At a minimum, the Selecting Official must interview the candidate selected for 
the position. The Selecting Official may designate one or more appropriate 
persons to conduct or participate in the interviews.  

B.  The Selecting Official should ask all candidates the same job-related 

questions and document the responses in writing. The Selecting Official 
should maintain such documentation for a minimum of two years. The 
Selecting Official should ask the same questions, in the same order, of all 
interviewed candidates. Follow-up questions to clarify information are 
permissible. It is preferable to conduct interviews in person and to use the 
same interview method for all applicants.  

C.  The Selecting Official should not ask questions regarding a candidate’s race, 
religion, sex, family status, national origin, religion, age, genetic background, 
health history, disability, political affiliation, or any other prohibited questions 
found in FEMA’s Interview and Selection Guidance, June 4, 2014.  

D.  The Selecting Official or his or her designee(s) may conduct a subsequent 

interview or contact one or more of the candidates for additional or clarifying 
information after completing and evaluating the initial interviews. The 

30 

 
 
 
supervisor should consult with the HR Specialist if a subsequent interview is 
deemed advisable to ensure that the reason for the subsequent interview is 
related to the requirements of the position.

not be destroyed. 

F.  In accordance with the Every Employee is an Emergency Manager (EE-EM) 
initiative,3 all employees conducting hiring interviews must explain and 
reiterate, using a set of standard questions and briefing points, the EE-EM 
vision that all COREs must be willing to receive incident support or incident 
management assignments. Additionally, all new COREs are required to sign 
an acknowledgment form confirming their understanding of the EE-EM policy. 
The supervisor must ensure that the EE-EM vision is explained in all initial 
interviews and that any candidate who is referred for hire or further 
examination has completed the applicable acknowledgment form. This form 
can be obtained from the serving HR Specialist. 

G.  All new COREs must acknowledge the requirement to work at a Directed 

Work Location, which may be the CORE’s Residence of Record or another 
alternate duty location, in the event of office closures, emergencies, or when 
otherwise directed. 

2-7.  Reference Checks 

The Selecting Official must check and document a candidate’s references before 
the candidate receives a job offer. Reference checking is a vital part of a 
successful hiring strategy and is primarily used to verify information provided by 
the candidate; better predict the candidate’s on-the-job success; and gain 
additional information about the candidate’s qualifications for the position. 
Selecting Officials may use FEMA Form 30-35, Telephone Reference Check, to 
satisfy the requirement to document reference checks. Selecting Officials should 
coordinate with OCCHCO prior to deciding not to hire a candidate because of a 
reference check. 

2-8.  Job Offers 

All offers of employment must be made by OCCHCO. The servicing HR 
Specialist must confirm qualifications and the proposed rate of pay for the 
candidate with the Selecting Official prior to extending an offer. Additionally, the 
HR Specialist will confirm acceptance of the offer and will consult with the 
Selecting Official in establishing an entrance on duty (EOD) date once the 
appropriate background check has been made by OCSO.

Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations, all personnel records made or 
kept by FEMA, including but not limited to, application forms submitted by 
applicants, name request justifications, interview notes, reference check 
documents, and other records having to do with hiring, shall be preserved for 
one year from the date of the making of the record or of the personnel action 
involved, whichever occurs later. 

C.  If applicable, when a non-selectee challenges the non-selection before an 

administrative or judicial body, OCCHCO and the supervisor must retain the 
aforementioned documentation until the final disposition of the charge or 
lawsuit. OCC will notify OCCHCO and the supervisor of any litigation holds 
and when documentation relating to a charge or lawsuit may be disposed of 
according to FEMA’s record retention policy.

provisions, re-employment rights, or adverse action procedures established 
under any statutory or regulatory provision. 

F.  COREs must be ready to deploy wherever FEMA needs their services and 

have 24 hours to respond to a deployment order and may be required to work 
long hours under stressful and unfavorable conditions. 

G.  A CORE’s appointment will end on the Not to Exceed (NTE) date of his or her 
appointment, unless it is extended or renewed based on the needs of FEMA. 

H.  COREs may be appointed to supervisory positions and serve as supervisors 
of record for other Stafford Act employees, provided that the CORE is hired 
into a position description classified as supervisory and completes mandatory 
supervisory training. COREs may serve as a temporary duty supervisor 
during a deployment, so long as the work supervised arises out of the 
Stafford Act and the period of supervision is temporary and/or short-term. 

I.  COREs, who serve as the supervisor of record for PFTs on the date when 

this Manual becomes effective, may continue to serve in such capacity until 
the CORE’s current term expires. 

3-3.  Conditions of Employment 

All CORE appointees are required to sign a Conditions of Employment statement 
upon appointment, and upon renewal of an appointment. COEs contain 
significant, but not all of, the DHS/FEMA and other rules and regulations that 
COREs must abide by, including but not limited to: 
A.  Complying with FEMA’s deployment procedures and policies;7 

B.  Using electronic funds transfer for salary payments and travel 

reimbursements; 

C.  Maintaining eligibility for a government issued travel charge card, and abiding 
by the terms and conditions established by the bank issuing the travel card  
and FEMA (see FD 122-9, Travel Charge Card, or superseding document); 

D.  Presenting and conducting themselves at all times in compliance with the 

standards of ethical conduct provided by the Office of Governmental Ethics 
(see 5 C.F.R. part 2635), preserving the public trust, and adhering to 
DHS/FEMA rules and regulations; 

E.  Traveling in the most expeditious and cost effective manner, abiding by DHS  

and FEMA travel policy to make all travel arrangements; 

7 See FD 010-8, FEMA Incident Workforce Deployment, January 29, 2014. 

34 

 
 
                                                           
F.  If authorized to use a motor vehicle for official business, complying with all 
applicable laws, regulations, and policies related to official motor vehicle 
usage; 

G.  Abiding by the terms of use in all revocable licensing agreements with respect 
to all FEMA-issued property, and using FEMA-issued property for official 
purposes only; and 

H.  Complying with FEMA Manual 123-9-1, Telework, if their supervisor 

authorizes telework. 

Failure to comply with these conditions of employment, or any other standards of 
conduct, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal from 
Federal service (see Chapter 11). 

3-4.  Directed Work Location 

COREs will work at their Residence of Record or other designated locations by 
FEMA supervisors and managers, if so directed. COREs may be directed to work 
at alternate locations on days when their regular worksite is closed due, but not 
limited to, weather closures, localized emergencies, facility safety, or for 
operational needs. COREs working at a Directed Work Location are not 
teleworking. 

3-5.  Oath of Office 

A.  The following FEMA personnel are authorized to administer the oath of office 

to newly appointed COREs or to delegate this authority: 

1.  The Administrator; 

2.  Deputy Administrator; 

3.  Regional Administrators; 

4.  The Chief Component Human Capital Officer; 

5.  Federal Coordinating Officers; and 

6.  Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinators. 

B.  The above officials may delegate authority to administer the oath of office to 

an employee at initial onboarding. 

3-6.  Government Property 

A.  As soon as practicable after appointment, FEMA shall furnish each CORE 
with appropriate mobile communication and/or computing equipment as 
determined by the current property authorization list. 

B.  COREs shall keep the equipment charged and accessible, and shall seek 

prompt assistance for malfunctioning equipment. 

C.  All COREs are required to accept receipt of all FEMA-issued equipment and 
sign FEMA Form 119-7-1-3. By signing this form, the CORE acknowledges 

35 

 
 
 
 
acceptance of and responsibility for the equipment and becomes a Custodian 
of the equipment, as set forth in FEMA Directive 119-7, Federal Personal 
Property Management, dated September 24, 2013. Violation of this 
agreement may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal. 

D.  COREs shall only use, display, or present their FEMA-issued government 

identification card for lawful and authorized purposes. 

3-7.  Reassignments to a New Position 

If a CORE is reassigned to a new position, the CORE must meet the minimum 
qualifications for the position and an Office or Directorate head must approve the 
reassignment. 

3-8.  Detail Assignments 

A.  A CORE may be temporarily placed on a detail to carry out a discrete 

function. If a CORE is placed on a detail, the duties and responsibilities 
performed by the CORE must be payable under the Stafford Act with the 
exception described in part C below. 

B.  Details to perform Stafford Act activities. Absent approval from OPM, a CORE 
may not be detailed to a competitive service position. A CORE may be placed 
on a detail assignment for up to 120 days that may be renewed for one 
additional 120 day period. OCCHCO must approve a CORE detailed to a 
position for more than 120 days or to positions at a higher pay level. See 
Chapter 14 for more information on rotational assignments. 

C.  A CORE may be detailed for mission and operational needs or for training to 

perform non-Stafford Act activities described below:  

1.  Non-Stafford Act Mission and Operational Detail. Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 

314 the Administrator is vested with the authority to carry out all 
authorities of FEMA. Upon a determination that urgent and compelling 
circumstances exist in order to carry out the FEMA mission or support to 
other Federal agency incident operations, a CORE may be placed on a 
temporary detail to perform non-Stafford Act activities under the following 
conditions:  

i.  The detail shall not exceed 90 days per appointment unless approved 

by OCC; and  

ii.  The detailed CORE’s salaries, benefits, and associated expenses must 
be paid from the account normally charged for carrying out the gaining 
program or activity for the duration of the detail. 

iii.  Note that training activities and other duties needed to prepare a 

CORE for a mission essential detail may be conducted outside of the 
90 day detail period but must be justified and approved in advance. In 
such circumstances, the training time and the detail time, will be 
charged to the receiving program or office. 

36 

 
 
 
2.  Non-Stafford Act Training Details. FEMA may authorize a non-Stafford Act 

detail of COREs under the following conditions:  

i.  A determination must be made that the training of the CORE, and thus 
the increased ability of that CORE to carry out future Stafford Act 
activities, is the primary purpose and benefit of the non-Stafford Act 
assignment;  

ii.  The detail may not exceed 30 days without a determination that a 

detail of more than 30 days is warranted;  

iii.  Extensions of these details beyond 30 days are made every 30 days 

thereafter and shall not exceed 90 days per appointment; and 

iv.   The detailed COREs may have their salaries and benefits funded by 

the DRF. 

3.  COREs carrying-out non-Stafford Act activities must be justified as either 
an urgent and compelling mission/operation-related detail or a training 
assignment. Under no circumstances, may FEMA use both of these 
justifications for the same non-Stafford Act activity. In both instances, the 
CORE is limited to one non-Stafford Act detail per appointment, unless 
approved by OCC.  

3-9.  Reappointment Procedures 

A.  OCCHCO provides each Office and Directorate with a list of COREs and their 

expiration dates on a biweekly basis. 

B.   A CORE’s appointment will end on the Not-to-Exceed (NTE) date of his or her 
appointment, unless it is renewed by the Office or Directorate. All requests to 
renew the appointment of a current CORE must be submitted by the 
supervisor of record to OCCHCO using an SF-52, Request for Personnel 
Action. 

C.  Two months before the end of a CORE’s appointment, if a supervisor of 

record determines that a CORE’s appointment should not be renewed, the 
supervisor must contact OCCHCO/Employee Relations on how to notify the 
CORE that the CORE’s appointment will not be renewed.   

3-10.  Resignation 

COREs may resign at any time prior to the termination or expiration of their 
appointments. COREs must state in writing the reason for the resignation and the 
requested effective date of the resignation. A CORE may request rescission of 
the resignation prior to the effective date, but FEMA is not obligated to consider 
or grant such a request. FEMA is not obligated to grant the request in order to 
avoid removal for misconduct or poor performance. FEMA may not deny the 
request for any reason prohibited by Title 29, U.S. Code, or any applicable EEOC 
regulations. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 4:  COMPENSATION PROVISIONS 

4-1.  Applicability 

The compensation provided to COREs includes the provisions found in this 
Chapter regardless of the pay plan covering the CORE, unless otherwise stated. 

4-2.  Establishment of CORE Pay Plan 

COREs are paid via an administratively determined “IC” pay plan. COREs paid 
via the GS scale or GS based pay bands will be transferred to the IC pay plan of 
either grades and steps or pay bands at their current rate of pay. FEMA 
managers, in conjunction with OCCHCO, are given the option to utilize one of 
two pay scales; a pay scale consisting of pay bands or a pay scale consisting of 
grades and steps (see Chapters 5 and 6). Offices or Directorates may change 
the pay plan for all COREs assigned to the Office or Directorate with OCCHCO 
approval. 

4-3.  Conversion Actions 

The first-level supervisor may recommend adjustment of pay upon conversion 
from another FEMA appointment to a CORE appointment (see sections 5-3 and 
6-3 for information on conversions that result in a decrease in pay). 

4-4.  Position Management and Classification 

The Position Management and Classification Manual, FM 252-2-1, June 19, 
2014, provides guidance for the classification and position management of 
CORE positions. The rules and procedures for position classification reviews 
(i.e., desk audits) and classification appeals found in FM 252-2-1 do not apply to 
CORE positions. 

4-5.  Locality Pay 

A.  Locality pay is an additional sum of money administratively-determined by 
OCCHCO and added to a CORE’s base pay to account for the difference 
between the pay of government workers and private sector workers in a given 
geographic location. Locality pay is considered a part of basic pay and is 
applied to the minimum and maximum rates of each pay plan.  

B.  COREs, such as IM COREs, who physically work full time from their 

residence of record, will receive the locality pay assigned to their residence of 
record’s locality pay area, even if the CORE reports or is assigned to a FEMA 
fixed facility with a different locality pay rate.  

C.  When a CORE moves from an official duty station in one locality pay area to 

an official duty station in a different locality pay area, OCCHCO will adjust the 
CORE’s basic pay to reflect the difference in the administratively-determined 
locality pay rates. Pay retention is not applicable to geographic changes in 
locality. 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4-6.  Cost of Living Increase 

OCCHCO may periodically recommend that the Administrator adjust pay scales 
for the CORE program. For example, an adjustment may be appropriate to reflect 
a cost of living increase, but need not coincide with changes to pay and wage 
schedules by Congress, OPM, or OPM’s designee. In such circumstances, 
OCCHCO will review current CORE pay rates and recommend the proper 
percentage adjustment that is appropriate. 

4-7.  Pay Ceilings and Premium Pay 

Absent a waiver for the bi-weekly pay cap, the maximum rate of basic pay for a 
FLSA-exempt CORE may not exceed the rate payable for Level V of the 
Executive Schedule or the rate for GS-15 Step 10 employees (including locality 
pay), whichever is higher (see FM 253-2-1, Premium Pay). The maximum 
aggregate amount any CORE may receive in basic pay, bonuses, and 
allowances is the rate for Level I of the Executive Schedule. 

The rules and regulations governing premium pay, including, but not limited to, 
the bi-weekly and annual pay caps, overtime, compensatory time off, and night 
differential for COREs is found in FM 253-2-1, Premium Pay. 

4-8.  Recruitment, Relocation, or Retention Incentives 

A.  In General 

1.  A recruitment incentive is a one-time, lump-sum payment to a newly 

appointed CORE to a position that is determined to be critical to FEMA’s 
mission and in the absence of the incentive, would be difficult to fill. 

2.  A relocation incentive is a one-time, lump-sum payment to a current 

CORE who agrees to relocate with no break in service to accept a FEMA 
position in a different geographic area if the position is likely to be difficult 
to fill in the absence of the incentive. 

3.  A retention incentive is paid to a current CORE if the CORE has unusually 
high or unique qualifications, or an Office or Directorate has a special 
need for the CORE’s services that makes it essential to retain the CORE, 
and the CORE would likely leave the Federal service in the absence of a 
retention incentive. The CORE must have stated an intent to resign or 
retire, in writing, or must have submitted his or her resignation or 
retirement paperwork prior to authorization. 

4.  The employing office must consider at least the following factors, as 
applicable to the case at hand, when deciding whether to pay a 
recruitment or relocation incentive: 

i.  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for similar positions, 
including indicators such as offer acceptance rates, the proportion of 
positions filled, and the length of time required to fill similar positions; 

ii.  Recent turnover in similar positions; 

39 

 
 
 
iii.  Labor-market factors that may affect the ability of the office to recruit 

candidates for similar positions now or in the future; 

iv.  Special qualifications needed for the position; and 

v.  The practicality of using an advanced rate alone or in combination with 

a recruitment or relocation incentive. 

5.  The employing office must consider at least the following factors, as 

applicable to the case at hand, when deciding whether to pay a retention 
incentive: 

i.  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates and retain 

employees with qualifications similar to those possessed by the CORE 
for positions similar to the position held by the CORE; and 

ii.  The availability in the labor market of candidates for employment who, 

with minimal training or disruption of service to the public, could 
perform the full range of duties and responsibilities assigned to the 
position held by the CORE. 

6.  The use of a recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive is not to be 
used as a substitute for traditional recruiting efforts that could yield a 
competent and qualified employee without the use of such an incentive.  

B.  Justification and Approval. The Selecting Official or supervisor of record shall 
submit a justification for any request for a recruitment, relocation, or retention 
incentive through the head of his or her Office or Directorate for approval. 
Office or Directorate heads may approve an incentive amount less than 
$20,000, or less than 25% of a CORE’s base pay. Any incentive request with 
a lump sum greater than or equal to $20,000, or greater than or equal to 25% 
of a CORE’s base pay must be submitted by the Associate Administrator or 
Office Chief (if the Office Chief reports directly to the Administrator) 
overseeing the requesting organization and be approved by the Administrator 
or designee, but at least by the Chief of Staff and OCCHCO. In all cases, 
OCCHCO must approve the incentive request and OCFO must certify the 
availability of funds prior to authorizing payment. All justifications shall 
include, at a minimum, the following information: 

1.  The amount and timing of the approved incentive; 

2.  For retention incentives, the payment schedule for the incentives and the 

maximum number of payments or end date for the payments; and 

3.  The basis for determination that the skills and work experience of the 
applicant or CORE are of substantial value, or that, without such an 
incentive, the position would be difficult-to-fill. The basis should be based 
on at least one factor from subsection A.4 if a recruitment or relocation 
bonus, or one factor from subsection A.5 if a retention incentive. 

C.  COREs who receive a recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive must sign 
and comply with the terms of a Continuing Service Agreement (CSA). See 
Chapter 15, Continuing Service Agreements, for more information.  

40 

 
4-9.  Offset Provision for Civilian Retirees 

A.  Retirees from the federal service who are receiving a federal retirement 

annuity and become reemployed by the federal government, absent a waiver, 
will have their salaries reduced by the amount of the annuity they are entitled 
to receive during the period of reemployment, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 8344(a). 

B.  COREs who are reemployed annuitants must provide OCCHCO with a copy 

of their most recent annuity notice issued by OPM, and all subsequent notices 
of change, indicating the monthly annuity amount to the Payroll and 
Processing Operations Division, OCCHCO prior to or at the time of 
appointment. 

41 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 5:  COMPENSATION (PAY BANDS) 

5-1.  General 

A.  This Chapter addresses the rules and procedures associated with 

compensating COREs via pay bands, which is one of the pay scales under 
the IC pay plan.  

B.  Each pay band established for the IC pay plan corresponds to a range of pay 
and classification levels, such that bands replace grades and steps, and 
series are retained. Positions are classified by title, career path, and 
occupational series. The pay range for each pay band is equivalent to the pay 
range of GS and IC grades and steps within the pay band. A CORE may not 
receive base pay in excess of his or her pay band unless they are promoted 
to a position classified at a higher pay band. 

1.  Band 1 corresponds to GS 1 to GS 6. 

2.  Band 2 corresponds to GS 7 to GS 9. 

3.  Band 3 corresponds to GS 10 to GS 11. 

4.  Band 4 corresponds to GS 12 to GS 13. 

5.  Band 5 corresponds to GS 14 to GS 15. 

C.  The major duties and responsibilities of each CORE position are included in 
the position description. The position description is analyzed by a Human 
Resources Classification Specialist to determine the title and pay band of the 
position. This analysis of the work to be performed and comparison of the 
work to established standards is referred to as position classification and 
applies the principle of equal pay for equal work. 

D.  Exceptions to the policies and procedures contained within this Chapter may 
be authorized by the CCHCO to respond to an emergent and unexpected 
mission need arising from a Level I disaster, to alleviate severe hardship to 
individuals resulting from any error on the part of FEMA in effecting personnel 
actions, or to address unusual situations that were not anticipated when this 
policy was drafted. 

5-2.  Setting Basic Rate of Pay 

A.  The Selecting Official is delegated the authority to assign a yearly basic pay 
amount within the position classified pay band. Pay setting criteria may 
include:  

1.  The prior salary of the candidate;  

2.  The overall qualifications of the candidate;  

3.  The recency of the individual’s relevant experience;  

4.  The qualifications and pay of employees in similar positions in the work 

unit;  

42 

 
 
5.  Salary comparability to non-Federal pay rates for similar work;  

6.  Special qualification requirements associated with the vacant position;  

7.  Turnover rates for the position;  

8.  Scarcity of qualified candidates; or 

9.  Programmatic urgency. 

B.  Any request for a rate above the minimum rate within the position classified 
pay band(s) must include a justification drafted by the Selecting Official and 
approved by the second level supervisor. This justification must include:  

1.  The candidate’s name; 

2.  The title, grade, and recommended rate of the vacant position; and 

3.  The factors and determination that support the pay rate determination. 

C.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and in accordance with Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission regulations, the justification for setting pay higher 
than the minimum rate shall be preserved for one year from the date of its 
making. 

5-3.  Pay Adjustments 

Adjustments to pay within a classified pay band may be requested by the 
supervisor of record for review and approval by the Human Resources Specialist 
without written justification or approval from the second level supervisor. Such 
adjustments may be given under the following circumstances: 

A.  Reassignment of a CORE from one position to another position within the 

same classified pay band if the responsibilities of the new position warrant an 
increase or decrease in base pay to further the principles of equal pay for 
equal work; 

B.  A pay change, of either an increase or decrease, to compensate for an 

increase or decrease in locality pay in conjunction with a move to another 
geographic area; or 

C.  Receipt of a merit-based increase (see section 5-4). 

5-4.  Merit-Based Increase 

A.  A CORE who is not already receiving the maximum basic pay for his or her 

position may receive a merit-based increase at the conclusion of the 
performance year. 

B.  A CORE, who receives a rating of record of “Achieved Expectations”, or 
equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based increase of up to 3%; a rating of 
record of “Exceeded Expectations” or equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based 
increase of up to 4%; or a rating of record of “Achieved Excellence” or 
equivalent, is eligible for a merit-based increase of up to 5%. 

43 

 
 
 
C.  A CORE, who receives a rating of “unacceptable”, or equivalent, is not eligible 

for a merit-based increase.8 

D.  A CORE’s supervisor of record must send an SF-52, approved by the second 

level supervisor, to the Payroll and Processing Division, OCCHCO for 
processing, certifying that the CORE has received an annual rating of record 
for the most recent performance cycle and that the percentage increase to 
basic pay sought by the supervisor of record is in compliance with the 
requirements established by section 5-3 above. 

5-5.  Promotion 

A.  A promotion is a personnel action that moves a CORE from one classified 
band to another in the same career path. A promotion may also be the 
selection and appointment of a CORE to a position in another career path or 
region to which the CORE applies. This may result in a combination of an 
increase in the CORE’s salary and a change in position description. If the 
CORE is moved to a different position, in the same pay band, with the same 
or similar duties, the personnel action is a reassignment with retained pay.  

B.  The CORE’s supervisor of record must certify that the CORE’s most recent 
performance rating was at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent, next 
higher graded work exists for the CORE to perform, the CORE’s new position 
description captures the duties to be performed, and the higher graded 
position is approved and funded. A CORE may be hired into a position in a 
higher pay band via vacancy announcement or a name request, if the Office 
or Directorate has an existing higher position available or creates a new 
position according to the procedures detailed in section 2-2. 

C.  The new basic pay rate upon promotion may be set at any level in the new 
band, but the CORE must receive at least a six percent minimum pay 
increase over his or her previous salary. If the CORE moves to a different 
career path, any band in the new career path would be considered a “new 
band” for the purposes of determining his or her salary. 

5-6.  Change to a Lower Pay Band 

When a CORE moves from his or her current position to a position at a lower pay 
band the action is referred to as a change to a lower pay band. The 
circumstances underlying the supervisor’s recommendation to initiate a change 
to a lower pay band will determine how pay is set. 

A.  A CORE who exhibits poor performance and fails to improve acceptably will 
be terminated (see Chapter 11 for more information). In rare occasions, 
COREs may be demoted in lieu of removal due to poor performance. In such 
circumstances, pay is set at a lower pay band such that there is a reduction in 

8 Supervisors who encounter poor performance should consult Chapter 11: Procedures for 
Misconduct and Poor Performance. 

44 

 
 
 
                                                           
pay equivalent to at least two steps (using the pay intervals from the grades 
and steps scale) below the higher banded position.  

B.  When a CORE requests a change to lower pay band for personal reasons or 
convenience, including through application for an announced vacancy at a 
lower pay band, the action is considered a voluntary change to a lower pay 
band. For voluntary changes to a lower pay band, the new rate will be set 
according to the procedures in section 5-2, and should include any merit 
based increases that the CORE would have received during the qualified 
period. 

C.  The reclassification of a position by OCCHCO to a lower pay band will result 
in a reduction in pay and pay will be set in accordance with the classification 
decision. Pay will be set according to the procedures detailed in section 5-2. 
No appeal of the reclassification decision or pay retention is permitted, 
subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

45 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 6:  COMPENSATION (GRADES AND STEPS) 

6-1.  General 

A.   A CORE may be paid via an administratively-determined “IC” grades and 

steps pay scale, as described in this Chapter. The pay scale consists of 15 
pay grades (IC-1 to IC-15) with 10 steps per grade. The pay sums associated 
with the IC pay scale mirror the GS scale. 

For example, a CORE hired at IC-11, Step 1 under the IC pay plan would be 
paid at the same basic rate of pay as a GS-11, Step 1 employee under the 
GS scale.  

B.  Exceptions to the policies and procedures contained within this Chapter may 
be authorized by the CCHCO to respond to an emergent and unexpected 
mission need arising from a Level 1 disaster, to alleviate severe hardship to 
individuals resulting from any error on the part of FEMA in effecting personnel 
actions or to address unusual situations that were not anticipated when this 
policy was drafted. 

6-2.  Setting Basic Rate of Pay 

A.  The position description is the primary source of information used in setting 
pay in the IC pay series. Other information used in setting pay is (1) the 
geographic location (official duty station) of the position; and, (2) the 
individual’s prior employment, salary history, and qualifications. 

B.  The major duties and responsibilities of each CORE position are included in 
its position description. The position description is analyzed by a Human 
Resources Specialist to determine the title and grade range of the position. 
This analysis of the work to be performed and comparison of the work to 
established standards is referred to as position classification and applies the 
principle of equal pay for equal work. 

C.  A new appointment is an individual’s first appointment as an employee of the 
Federal government. Pay for all new COREs will be set at the minimum rate 
(Step 1) of the grade of the position, unless the CORE is approved for an 
advanced rate (see part E Advanced to a Higher Step). 

D.  If the CORE has prior federal service (including as a current or former FEMA 
employee), OCCHCO sets the basic rate of pay at the minimum rate for the 
position, unless they receive an advanced rate (as discussed below) or the 
highest pay rate previously received during Federal service, whichever is 
higher.9 Before setting pay at the highest pay rate previously received during 
Federal service, the Selecting Official should consider: 

1.  The overall qualifications of the individual; 

2.  The recency of the individual’s relevant experience; 

9 If the employee’s highest previously-received pay rate falls between two steps of the IC pay 
scale, the Selecting Official may request that the employee’s pay be set at the higher step. 

46 

 
 
                                                           
3.  The qualifications and pay of employees in similar positions in the work 

unit; and 

4.  The potential impact on the morale of those employees if the candidate 

were to receive the maximum payable rate. 

E.  Advanced to a Higher Step.  

1.  Prior to a candidate entering on duty, the Selecting Official will consider 
whether pay above the minimum rate of the grade should be made for a 
CORE. 

2.  Pay rate decisions maintain equity between the pay of the new hire and 

that of current employees, including COREs, performing comparable work. 
The advanced rate may not exceed step 10 of the applicable grade to 
which the candidate will be hired. 

3.  Required documentation and approval: 

i.  A request to advance a CORE up to step four may be submitted by the 
first or second level supervisor to OCCHCO for approval. A request to 
advance a CORE to step five and above must be submitted by the 
head of an Office or Directorate to OCCHCO for approval. The request 
must be accompanied by a written justification that includes: 

a.   The candidate’s name; 

b.  The title, grade, and recommended rate of the vacant position; and 

c.  The factors and determination that support the pay rate 

determination. This may include, but is not limited to, salary 
comparability, special qualification requirements, turnover rates, 
scarcity of qualified candidates, or programmatic urgency. 

ii.  The first or second level supervisor must submit a recommendation for 
an advanced rate appointment well in advance of establishing an 
entrance on duty date to ensure sufficient time for OCCHCO to act on 
the request before the appointment becomes effective. 

iii.  Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and in accordance with EEOC 

regulations, the justification shall be preserved for one year from the 
date of its making. 

6-3.  Pay Adjustments 

Adjustments to pay within a grade after the pay rate is initially set may be given 
under the following circumstances: 

A.  Reassignment of a CORE from one position to another position if the 

responsibilities of the new position warrant an increase or decrease in base 
pay to further the principles of equal pay for equal work; 

47 

 
 
B.  A pay change, of either an increase or decrease, to compensate for an 

increase or decrease in locality pay in conjunction with a move to a different 
official duty station in another geographic area; or 

C.  Receipt of a step increase (see section 6-4). 

6-4.  Step Increases 

A.  A CORE who is not already at the highest step of his or her current grade 
may be advanced to the next higher step at the conclusion of the waiting 
period assigned to their current rate. 

1.  While FEMA’s Stafford Act authorities permit FEMA the authority to 

compensate without regard to Title 5, FEMA adopts the waiting periods for 
advancement to the next highest step established by 5 U.S.C. § 5335 and 
its implementing regulation at 5 C.F.R. § 531.405 as a matter of policy for 
all COREs paid via grades and steps. 

2.  A CORE is not automatically entitled to receive a step increase at the 

conclusion of his or her waiting period.  

3.  To receive the step increase, the CORE’s supervisor of record must sign 
the step increase document and return to OCCHCO for processing, 
certifying that the CORE: 

i.  Has completed the requisite waiting period;  

ii.  Has not received an equivalent increase during the waiting period; and  

iii.  His or her summary rating level for the most recent performance was 

at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent. 

4.  If a supervisor determines that a CORE’s performance is not at an 

acceptable level, the supervisor should contact OCCHCO/Employee 
Relations at least two months before the end of the required waiting period 
for a step increase, to draft a notification to the CORE stating that the 
CORE’s next step increase is being withheld, the reason for the negative 
determination, and what the CORE must do to improve his or her 
performance to be granted the step increase. 

B.  Prior to the completion of the requisite waiting period, a supervisor may 
recommend one additional step increase if warranted by the CORE’s 
performance. To receive the additional step increase, the CORE’s supervisor 
of record must send a justification describing the accomplishments and 
performance exhibited by the CORE that would warrant an increase in pay, 
and an SF-52 approved by the second level supervisor to OCCHCO for 
processing. OCCHCO will review the request to ensure COREs who exhibit 
similar performance receive similar pay. 

48 

 
 
 
6-5.  Promotion 

A.  A promotion is a personnel action that moves a qualified CORE from one 

grade to another in the same career path or to a grade in another career path 
in combination with an increase in the CORE’s salary. 

B.  The CORE’s supervisor of record must certify that the CORE’s most recent 
performance rating was at least “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent, next 
higher graded work exists for the CORE to perform, the CORE’s new position 
description captures the duties to be performed, and the higher graded 
position is approved and funded. A CORE may be hired into a position at a 
higher grade via vacancy announcement or a name request, if the Office or 
Directorate has an existing higher graded position available or creates a new 
position according to the procedures detailed in section 2-2.  

C.  For promotions, pay is set at the lowest pay rate in the new grade; however, 
the new pay rate must exceed the CORE’s existing pay rate by at least two 
steps. If the annual rate of the new position falls between two steps of the 
new grade, the higher step may be used. For example, an IC-7, Step 3 at 
FEMA HQ, with an annual pay rate of $45,473, who is promoted to an IC-8, is 
entitled to at least an increase in pay equal to two steps from the position 
from which she was promoted at IC-7 Step 5, or $48,315. Because the annual 
pay rate for an IC-8, Step 1 is $47,212, it does not satisfy the two-step 
increase requirement. Therefore, pay is set at IC-8, Step 2 or $48,786. 

6-6.  Change to Lower Grade 

When a CORE moves from his or her current position to a position at a lower 
grade the action is referred to as a change to lower grade. The circumstances 
underlying the supervisor’s recommendation to initiate a change to lower grade 
will determine how pay is set. 

A.  A CORE who exhibits poor performance and fails to improve acceptably will 
be terminated (see Chapter 11 for more information). In rare occasions, 
COREs may be demoted in lieu of removal due to poor performance. Upon 
demotion, the pay rate must be set at least two steps below the current pay 
rate. If the two-step reduction results in a rate that falls between two steps of 
the lower grade, the lower step must be used. 

B.  When a CORE requests a change to lower grade for personal reasons or 
convenience, including through application for an announced vacancy at a 
lower grade, the action is considered a voluntary change to a lower grade. 
For voluntary changes to a lower grade, the new rate should include any step 
increase that the CORE would have received during the qualifying period and 
pay should be set at: 

1.  The minimum  payable rate of basic pay for the lower grade; or 

2.  The highest previous rate received under Federal service, if the action is 
fair and equitable after considering the factors listed in section 6-2, and if 
the action serves the convenience of the Government. 

49 

 
 
C.  The reclassification of a position by OCCHCO to a lower grade range will 
result in a reduction in pay and pay will be set in accordance with the 
classification decision. Pay will be set according to the procedures detailed in 
section 6-2. No appeal of the reclassification decision or pay retention is 
permitted, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

50 

 
 
 
7-1.  General 

CHAPTER 7:  BENEFITS 

A.  With certain exceptions that apply to individuals such as reemployed 

annuitants, CORE are eligible for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB), 
Federal Employees Dental/Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP), Federal 
Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI), Federal Employees Retirement 
System (FERS), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Federal Long Term Care 
Insurance (FLTCIP), and participation in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). 

B.  COREs must review their benefit options and make selections within 

prescribed election periods. OCCHCO, Employee Services Division, will 
provide timely information to COREs with regard to available benefit options, 
election periods, and technical direction regarding how to apply for these 
options.  

C.  OCCHCO staff is prohibited from making any type of recommendation that 
may influence a CORE’s benefit election. COREs need to evaluate cost, 
personal needs, and eligible family members and their needs when preparing 
to make a benefits selection. 

D.  FEMA applies guidance contained within OPM Benefits Administration Letter, 
No. 13-203, when extending benefits to legally married same-sex spouses 
and common law marriages in certain states, of Federal employees and 
annuitants, and to the children of those marriages. 

7-2.  Health Benefits 

A.  COREs are given an opportunity to enroll in the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program (FEHB) at the time of appointment to a CORE position. 

B.  A CORE must decide whether to elect to enroll in FEHB within 60 days after 
the effective date of appointment. A CORE who elects to enroll must submit 
SF-2809 to his or her HR Specialist. A CORE who fails to return the 
completed form within the prescribed time frame, or who cancels enrollment 
will not have another opportunity to enroll until an FEHB open season is 
offered (generally once per year), or as a result of a Qualifying Life Event 
(QLE). 

C.  The CORE’s share of the premium for the benefits plan chosen will be 

deducted from the CORE’s bi-weekly pay on a pre-tax basis.  A CORE may 
cancel health benefits coverage during an extended period of non-pay status 
or may continue the coverage and pay the premium each pay period or upon 
return to pay status. Effective dates for enrollment, changes in enrollment, 
and cancellation of enrollment will be established in accordance with 
guidance prescribed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 

51 

 
 
7-3.  FEDVIP (Dental and Vision) Program 

A.  The Federal Employees’ Dental/Vision Program (FEDVIP) is a supplemental 
program offering vision and dental coverage to Federal employees, retirees, 
and their eligible family members on an enrollee-pay-all basis.  

B.  COREs, retirees, and their eligible family members are eligible to enroll in 

FEDVIP if they are eligible to enroll in FEHB and the CORE’s position is not 
excluded by law or regulation.10 COREs who are not enrolled in FEHB may 
still be eligible for FEDVIP, providing they are eligible to enroll in FEHB. 

C.  New and newly eligible COREs may enroll within 60 days after they become 
eligible. COREs may also enroll during the annual Federal Benefits Open 
Season in November and December. 

7-4.  Life Insurance 

Unless a CORE elects to waive coverage prior to the end of the pay period in 
which appointed, eligible COREs are automatically insured for basic life coverage 
on the day the CORE enters on duty in a pay status. Within 60 days after the 
effective date of appointment to a CORE position, a CORE who has basic life 
insurance coverage may also elect standard, additional, and/or family optional 
insurance. A CORE may decrease or waive all life insurance coverage at any 
time. Effective dates of life insurance coverage and waivers will be in accordance 
with the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program and OPM 
guidance. FEGLI is not included in the annual benefits open season and open 
season periods are rare. 

7-5.  Retirement 

A.  As a general rule, employees appointed to CORE positions are automatically 
covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Exceptions 
include certain former Federal employees who were hired prior to January 1, 
1984, and were covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). 
Retirement coverage, whether FERS, CSRS, or CSRS Offset, begins on the 
effective date of appointment to a CORE position.  

B.  COREs who are covered by FERS, and first appointed: 

1.  Before 2013, contribute 0.8% of pay to the Civil Service Retirement and 

Disability Fund (CSRDF); 

2.  In 2013, contribute 3.1% of pay to the CSRDF; or 

3.  After December 31, 2013, contribute 4.4% of pay to the CSRDF. 

4.  Employee contributions to the CSRDF may change according to changes 

in the FERS program. 

10 See 5 C.F.R. § 894.302 or an HR Specialist to determine whether a position is excluded from 
FEDVIP. 

52 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
7-6.  Thrift Savings Plan 

A.  The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a tax-deferred retirement savings and 

investment plan that provides COREs with an opportunity to save a portion of 
their income for retirement and reduce current taxes.  

B.  Eligibility for participation is determined by FEMA in accordance with law and 
TSP regulations published by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. 

C.  COREs, covered by FERS, appointed after July 31, 2010, are automatically 

enrolled in the TSP. 

D.  COREs can elect, change their election, or stop their contributions at any time 
through the Employee Personal Page (EPP) or by completing and submitting 
a TSP-1 Election form. 

7-7.  Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program 

Long-Term Care insurance provides financial protection to enrollees who are in 
need of assistance with their daily activities due to a lengthy or lifelong illness, 
injury, or cognitive impairment. Long-Term Care insurance is medically 
underwritten; therefore, a CORE and eligible family members must qualify for the 
insurance. Eligible COREs can enroll at any time; however, newly-hired COREs 
and their spouses receive a 60-day window to enroll using an abbreviated 
underwriting process. 

7-8.  Flexible Spending Accounts 

Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) allows COREs to set aside money on a pre-
tax basis to cover out-of-pocket health care or dependent care expenses. A 
newly eligible CORE has 60 days from the date of his or her appointment to elect 
to set aside this money by payroll deduction. A CORE who wishes to participate 
or continue to participate from one plan year to the next must make a positive 
election during the annual open season, which runs concurrent with the health 
insurance open season. Changes can be made outside of the benefits open 
season as a result of a Qualifying Life Event (QLE). 

7-9.  Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 

COREs have access to confidential work life enhancement services through the 
EAP, free of charge. The EAP is a professional resource available to help 
COREs resolve life challenges. A CORE may call the toll-free EAP number at 1-
800-222-0364, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A CORE can also access EAP 
services online at www.FOH4you.com. 

7-10.  Transit Subsidy Program 

Subject to the availability of funds, all COREs who are currently using public 
transportation to commute to work are eligible for transit subsidy benefits.  The 
Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Support Services and Facilities 
Management Division (SSFMD), administers the transit subsidy program. 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
COREs interested in receiving a transit subsidy must complete FEMA Form 254-
1-1, Public Transportation Benefit Program Application, and email it to the Transit 
Subsidy Program at FEMA-Transit-Subsidy@fema.dhs.gov.  

54 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 8:  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT 

8-1.  General 

A.  CORE performance management shall comply with the Employee 

Performance Management Program as established by FM 255-1-1. 

B.  A CORE who receives a rating of unacceptable, or equivalent, on his or her 

most recent appraisal (rating of record) may be subject to removal in 
accordance with Chapter 11 of this Manual. Such removal should be effected 
regardless of the timing of the CORE’s NTE date. However, a supervisor is 
not precluded from terminating a CORE prior to issuance of a performance 
appraisal, so long as the supervisor has sufficient documentation to justify the 
action and has consulted with an OCCHCO Employee Relations Specialist. 

8-2.  Performance Management for CORE-Is 

The performance of IMAT members appointed as CORE-Is are subject to FD 
010-7, and are not covered by FEMA Manual 255-1-1 or this Chapter. 

8-3.  Deployment Performance Management 

A.  When deployed to a disaster for twenty days or more, a CORE qualified in a 
FQS position, and deployed to that position, will receive an evaluation of the 
CORE’s deployment performance by a temporary duty supervisor. The 
evaluation period consists of the entire time the CORE is deployed. 

B.  COREs will be evaluated on their performance based on the performance 

goals developed by Cadre Coordinators for each position within a Cadre. The 
goals will align with the position-specific knowledge of program and technical 
protocols contained in the position’s PTB, and the core competencies for 
deployed personnel. 

C.  The temporary duty supervisor will complete a deployment evaluation in a 
timely manner and transmit the evaluation to the CORE’s supervisor of 
record. Additionally, the HR Unit Leader and his or her staff will ensure that 
any demobilized CORE who is deployed for at least twenty days is issued a 
performance evaluation prior to departing the incident work site. 

D.  If a CORE’s deployment performance does not meet achieved expectations, 
the CORE’s supervisor of record in coordination with the Cadre Coordinator 
and/or temporary duty supervisor will collaborate with OCCHCO to determine 
the appropriate course of action. 

E.  A CORE’s progress review and appraisal (rating of record) should include 
input received after a deployment from the temporary duty supervisor. 
However, the supervisor of record has the discretion to consider the 
deployment performance evaluation as he or she deems appropriate when 
completing progress reviews and the annual appraisal (rating of record) 
subsequent to the deployment. 

55 

 
 
 
F.  If the CORE is deployed at the time that the CORE’s quarterly progress 

review should take place, the supervisor of record will work with the CORE 
and his or her temporary duty supervisor to obtain feedback on the CORE’s 
performance during the applicable quarter. 

56 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 9:  AWARDS AND RECOGNITION 

9-1.  Awards and Recognition Program 

The Awards and Recognition program applicable to Title 5 employees and 
captured in FEMA Manual 255-4-1 is also applicable to COREs, with the 
exception of CORE-Is. Awards and recognition policy applicable to CORE-I 
IMATs is found in FD 010-7. 

57 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 10:  SCHEDULING OF WORK AND TELEWORK 

10-1.  Scheduling of Work and Telework 

A.  FM 106-1-1, Scheduling of Work, applies to all COREs. To establish a work 

schedule a CORE must submit a copy of FEMA Form 106-1-1-1, Request for 
Work Schedule, to his or her supervisor of record for approval.  

B.  COREs will use FEMA approved timekeeping policies and procedures to 

account for all hours of work. 

C.  FM 123-9-1, Telework Manual, applies to all COREs. To establish a telework 
agreement and schedule a CORE must submit a copy of FEMA Form 123-9-
0-1, Telework Application and Agreement Form, and FEMA Form 123-9-0-2, 
Employee Self-Certification Safety and Health Checklist, to his or her 
supervisor of record for approval.  

D.  COREs whose Residence of Record is their permanent duty station are not 

teleworking when on duty. However, all COREs whose Residence of Record 
is their official duty station must have a completed and approved Employee 
Self-Certification Safety and Health Checklist forms on-file with FEMA prior to 
being permitted to work.  

58 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 11:  PROCEDURES FOR MISCONDUCT AND POOR PERFORMANCE 

11-1.  General 

A.  COREs are non-Title 5 employees and, therefore normally do not have 

appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

B.  Supervisors must communicate proper conduct and performance standards. 
Supervisors must also set an example for proper conduct and performance 
for their subordinates. 

C.   Supervisors must identify and deal with misconduct and unacceptable 

performance as they occur. 

D.  Supervisors must document problems as they occur and follow up with 

COREs to ensure they understand the seriousness of their behavior and/or 
performance deficiencies. Documentation does not have to be lengthy. It can 
be a brief summary of key facts and issues, with names, dates and times that 
the incident(s) occurred. This documentation must be created in a timely 
manner and preserved for potential litigation and may be subject to discovery.  

E.  Supervisors should immediately contact their servicing Employee Relations 

Specialist when misconduct or performance issues occur to obtain advice and 
guidance before taking any official action. If this issue involves misconduct, 
supervisors must report the matter as required by FD 123-19, paragraph III.D.  

F.  When making a determination of lack of fitness to encumber a FEMA position, 
or that the CORE’s security clearance is being suspended or revoked under 
DHS Instruction 121-01-007, OCSO shall immediately notify Employee 
Relations. 

11-2.  Addressing Misconduct 

A.  Misconduct must be reported to FEMA HQ in accordance with FD 123-19, 

Administrative Investigations Directive (AID), and, depending on the status of 
the CORE and the alleged misconduct, to the DHS OIG. It can be difficult to 
determine whether a CORE’s actions constitute misconduct or poor 
performance, or whether suspected misconduct triggers the requirements to 
report the suspected misconduct to DHS OIG or the AID Committee. As such, 
consultation with OCCHCO is critical to determining the proper course of 
action. The Employee Relations Specialist will recommend the appropriate 
option and provide the required documentation to the manager for issuance to 
the CORE. FD 123-19 and its accompanying Manual, FM 123-19-1, provide 
procedures for reporting misconduct and investigating it prior to determining if 
disciplinary action for any substantiated misconduct is to be recommended. 

B.  Options to Address Misconduct 

1.  Counseling. A counsel is an informal verbal advisement by a supervisor 
to a CORE of misconduct that must be corrected, yet which avoids any 
lasting adverse effect on a CORE’s personnel record. The purpose of 
counseling is to correct misconduct problems soon after they occur in 

59 

 
 
order to prevent the need for formal discipline. Counseling is an 
appropriate response to minor misconduct when the CORE has a 
generally good record, with no prior instances of misconduct, and is 
committed to correcting the problem. Documentation is not required; 
however, a follow-up e-mail recounting the conversation entitled 
“Discussion dated XX” can be provided to the CORE and is strongly 
recommended. At a minimum the supervisor shall send an email to 
himself or herself to document the content of the conversation. Counseling 
can be used to demonstrate that the CORE was put on notice about the 
problem and knew of the potential for a harsh penalty if the problem 
continued. A memorandum documenting the counseling is not placed in 
the CORE’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF). 

2.   Reprimand. A written reprimand is the lowest level of formal discipline 
addressed to the CORE and signed by the immediate supervisor (or 
higher level supervisor in the chain of command). Depending on the 
severity of the misconduct, it may be appropriate for a first offense of 
misconduct, when written formal discipline is necessary or, when verbal 
counseling has been ineffective in correcting misconduct. The reprimand 
should include, as a minimum, the following information: 

i.  Reference previous counseling or other action that was relied on to 

support the action (if any); 

ii.  Advise the CORE of any applicable appeal rights, such as the right to 
file an appeal with the next higher level supervisor within five calendar 
days after receipt of the reprimand; 

iii.  Advise the CORE of the potential negative consequences of future 

misconduct; 

iv.  Advise the CORE of Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services 

available to assist with any work-related or personal concerns that may 
have an impact on performance and/or behavior at work; 

v.  Inform the CORE of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program 
and of his or her right to seek counseling with an EEO advisor if he or 
she believes the reprimand is based on a prohibited factor; 

vi.  State whether a copy of the reprimand will be placed in the CORE’s 

OPF, which may be for a period not to exceed 3 years; 

vii. Identify the servicing Employee Relations Specialist to contact for 

questions concerning the reprimand; and  

viii. Provide a signature line upon which the CORE will acknowledge 

receipt of the notice of reprimand. 

3.  Suspension. A suspension temporarily removes the CORE from the 

performance of duties without pay for a specified period, and is recorded 
in the CORE’s official personnel record. A notice of suspension is a 
memorandum on FEMA letterhead, addressed to the CORE, and signed 

60 

 
by the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor in the chain of 
command. 

i. 

 The supervisor of record forwards a copy of the notice (signed and 
dated by the supervisor) and the SF-52 to the Employee Relations 
Specialist. The Specialist codes the SF-52 and forwards it to the 
OCCHCO for processing. 

ii.   The notice of a suspension should include, as a minimum, the 

following information: 

a.  Identify the specific charge(s), supporting information, regulations 

or policies violated; 

b.  Identify the effective date of the action; 

c.  Advise the CORE of any applicable appeal rights, such as the right 
to appeal the suspension to the next-higher level supervisor within 
five calendar days of receipt of the notice, and of the CORE’s right 
to file a grievance under any applicable collective bargaining 
agreement; 

d.  Inform the CORE of his or her right to seek counseling with an EEO 

advisor if he or she believes the suspension is based on a 
prohibited factor; 

e.  Advise the CORE how to contact the EAP to assist with any work-
related or personal concerns that may have an impact on the 
CORE’s conduct at work; 

f.  Provide the name and telephone number of the servicing Employee 
Relations Specialist whom the CORE may contact for questions; 
and 

g.  Provide a signature line upon which the CORE will acknowledge 

receipt of the notice of suspension. 

4.  Removal from Federal Service. A removal from federal service is 

recorded in the CORE’s personnel record, and is the most severe form of 
discipline available to a manager. Removal may be appropriate when the 
facts and supporting information cause the supervisor to conclude that the 
CORE has demonstrated an unwillingness or refusal to conform to 
acceptable standards of conduct, a lesser penalty would not deter future 
misconduct, or there is little probability of the CORE’s rehabilitation.  

i.  A notice of removal is a memorandum on FEMA Letterhead addressed 
to the CORE from the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor 
in the chain of command). The notice should include the same items 
identified in section 11-2.B.3.ii. (Content of a suspension notice). 

ii.  The CORE’s immediate supervisor, or any higher-level supervisor in 

the CORE’s chain of command, should give the notice to the CORE at 
or before the effective date of the notice and request that the CORE 

61 

 
acknowledge receipt at the bottom of the last page of the notice. If the 
CORE refuses to sign the notice acknowledging receipt, the supervisor 
should place a note on the last page to indicate that the notice was 
given to the CORE and the CORE refused to acknowledge receipt. 
Failure to acknowledge receipt has no impact on implementation of the 
decision. 

5.  Removal Based on a Determination of Lack of Fitness for a FEMA 
Position. All COREs must meet fitness standards established in DHS 
Instruction 121-01-007. 

i.  OCSO has the authority to determine a CORE’s fitness, based on a 
background investigation at the time of entry on duty and every five 
years thereafter (or more frequently as circumstances warrant). 

ii.  When OCSO has determined that a CORE does not meet the fitness 
standard, in accordance with the procedures in DHS Instruction 121-
01-007, OCSO shall notify OCCHCO/Employee Relations, which shall 
coordinate with the CORE’s supervisor and OCSO to deny the CORE 
unescorted access to DHS/FEMA facilities. In addition, DHS Sensitive 
Systems Policy Directive 4300A requires that DHS employees have a 
favorably adjudicated background investigation to be granted access to 
DHS Information Technology systems. Therefore, COREs who do not 
meet the fitness standard are normally required to turn in their FEMA 
equipment (e.g., laptop, Blackberry, etc.) and are placed on non-duty, 
non-pay status. The CORE may request to use any available accrued 
leave during this period. 

iii.  With the concurrence of OCCHCO/Employee Relations and the Office 
of Chief Counsel, the supervisor of record issues a removal decision to 
a CORE under his or her supervision deemed unfit to encumber a 
FEMA position. The notice should include the same items identified in 
section 11-2.B.3.ii. (content of a suspension notice).  

iv.  The removal decision shall include the right to appeal within five 

calendar days after the removal is effective. Appeals from removal 
decisions are decided by the Associate or Deputy Associate 
Administrator, Mission Support. 

6.  Recovery of Government Equipment. Supervisors shall collect all 
government equipment prior to the effective date of the removal. 

11-3.  Addressing Poor Performance 

CORE supervisors and managers should consult FM 255-1-1, Employee 
Performance Management Program, for more information on dealing with poor 
performance. Most performance problems can be resolved through effective 
communication between the supervisor and CORE. The supervisor should, at a 
minimum, take the following steps: 

62 

 
 
A.  Discuss performance deficiencies with any CORE whose performance is 

substandard. This discussion provides the supervisor the opportunity to clarify 
job expectations, and to identify performance deficiencies. It provides the 
CORE with clear direction as to what he or she needs to do to improve his or 
her performance to an acceptable level. The supervisor should document the 
discussion and provide the CORE with a copy of the documentation to 
prevent misunderstandings, or mischaracterization of the discussion.  

B.  Monitor the CORE’s performance following the discussion, and document the 

CORE’s progress toward improving his or her performance. 

C.  The supervisor must discuss the CORE’s performance deficiencies with the 
Employee Relations Specialist for guidance on (1) whether to remove a 
CORE for substandard performance immediately or (2) to provide the CORE 
time to demonstrate improvement, and if so, the length of time to do so. A 
“performance expectations” memorandum is a helpful tool that the supervisor 
can issue to the CORE. The Employee Relations Specialist will assist the 
supervisor with drafting any correspondence regarding performance 
problems. The supervisor will provide the Specialist with a signed and dated 
copy of the final document. The supervisor must document the deficiencies 
with memoranda, emails, work products and any other documentation that 
demonstrates the deficiencies. COREs are not placed on formal Performance 
Improvement Plans (PIPs). 

D.  Removal from Federal Service. 

1.  A removal from federal service is recorded in the CORE’s personnel 

record, and is the most severe form of discipline available to a manager. A 
notice of removal is a memorandum on FEMA Letterhead addressed to 
the CORE from the immediate supervisor (or higher level supervisor in the 
chain of command). 

2.  The notice should include the same items identified in section 11-2.B.3.ii 

(content of a suspension notice). 

3.  The CORE’s immediate supervisor, or any higher-level supervisor in the 

CORE’s chain of command, must give the notice to the CORE at or before 
the effective date of the notice and request that the CORE acknowledge 
receipt at the bottom of the last page of the notice. If the CORE refuses to 
sign the notice acknowledging receipt, the supervisor should place a note 
on the last page to indicate that the notice was given to the CORE and the 
CORE refused to acknowledge receipt. Failure to acknowledge receipt 
has no impact on implementation of the decision. 

E.  In rare circumstances, the supervisor may initiate a reassignment to another 
position in a lower pay band or IC pay grade, whichever is applicable, in lieu 
of removal, to address poor performance after receiving concurrence from the 
Employee Relations Specialist and the Office of Chief Counsel. In such 
circumstances, the CORE’s rate of pay will be reduced in accordance with 
Chapters 5 and 6. 

63 

 
11-4.  Deployment Scenarios 

COREs may be assigned to perform incident management and incident support 
duties based on the operational needs of FEMA and subject to the policies 
contained within FD 010-8, FEMA Incident Workforce Deployment. During 
deployment, supervisors of record receive feedback on the performance of 
COREs during deployments from the CORE’s temporary duty supervisors. 
Temporary duty supervisors provide day-to-day supervision of the performance 
of deployed COREs. 

A.  Temporary duty supervisors must consult with the supervisor of record and  

OCCHCO/Employee Relations Branch when they encounter poor 
performance, and provide all documents to the supervisor of record. 

B.   Temporary duty supervisors who become aware of allegations of misconduct 
shall notify the supervisor of record of the allegation. The supervisor of record 
shall consult with OCCHCO/Employee Relations before initiating disciplinary 
action. The supervisor of record will notify the temporary duty supervisor of 
any impending disciplinary action. In all cases in which misconduct is alleged, 
the Employee Relations Branch shall provide advice to the Federal 
Coordinating Officer (FCO) and the supervisor of record as to the propriety of 
the following options: 

1.  Releasing the CORE from the deployment into a non-duty, non-pay status; 

2.  Releasing the CORE and returning him or her to the official duty station, or  

3.  Keeping the CORE deployed pending completion of any needed 

investigation or issuance of disciplinary action. 

C.  If the supervisor of record and FCO disagree whether to demobilize the 

CORE, the issue will be resolved by the Associate Administrator of Response 
and Recovery. 

11-5.  Arrest, Indictment, and other Allegations of Misconduct 

A.  FEMA may receive information that a CORE has been arrested, indicted for a 

crime, used an illegal drug, or has allegedly committed other serious 
misconduct. Supervisors may learn of this information in a variety of ways, 
including the CORE’s self-report or via other employees, the Office of the 
Chief Security Office (OCSO), or press reports. Upon receipt of such 
information, the supervisor of record, FCO, or temporary duty supervisor shall 
contact Employee Relations for guidance. 

B.  If the CORE is incarcerated or otherwise unable to come to work, the 

supervisor must first address the leave status. COREs may use available 
leave, if requested and approved by the supervisor. If the request is denied, 
the CORE shall be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status. The supervisor is 
not obligated to approve a leave request submitted by the CORE. 

64 

 
 
 
C.  If the CORE is available for duty following arrest, or, if not arrested, but is 
under investigation for alleged misconduct, the following factors must be 
considered in determining whether the CORE shall be permitted to return to 
duty pending resolution of the criminal action or other serious misconduct: 

1.  If the CORE has a security clearance, OCSO, Personnel Security Division 

(PSD), may suspend a CORE’s security clearance upon receipt of 
adverse information, such as an arrest or indictment. If PSD suspends the 
CORE’s clearance, or revokes it, PSD shall notify ER. Normally, COREs 
would be placed in non-duty, non-pay status until a recommendation on 
removal can be made by ER to the supervisor of record. 

2.  For COREs without security clearances, OCSO must determine if the 

CORE is fit for continued employment. Thus, until OCSO has rendered a 
determination on the CORE’s fitness, the supervisor of record must 
determine whether the CORE should be allowed to continue to work 
(including telework), be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status or be 
terminated pending the outcome of the criminal case, considering the 
following factors after consultation with ER, OCC’s Personnel Law Branch, 
and OCSO: 

i.  What is the nature of the offense or other serious misconduct? The 
more serious the offense, the more likely that the CORE should not 
return to duty. 

ii.  What evidence is there as to the commission of the offense? The lack 
of corroboration or confession especially with a minor offense, may 
weigh in favor of the CORE’s retention on duty. 

iii.  Does the known evidence suggest that the CORE is a physical or 

logical security risk? 

iv.  Impact on the Mission: Are there other factors that indicate that the 

mission will be adversely affected if the CORE is returned to duty, such 
as notoriety? Is the offense known, causing perceived damage to a 
Directorate’s, Office’s, or JFO’s ability to conduct business or its 
credibility due to the CORE’s continued presence? 

3.  Authority to return the CORE to duty pending resolution of criminal 

matters: After consultation with ER, and subject to approval, if required, by 
the Office of Inspector General: 

i.  For COREs who are deployed, the FCO shall make the final decision 
as to whether the CORE shall remain at the JFO, after consultation 
with the supervisor of record (see section 11-4 for resolution of 
disputes on this matter between FCO and the supervisor of record). 

ii.  For COREs at their official duty station, the supervisor of record shall 
make the final decision as to whether the CORE shall return to duty. 

65 

 
 
11-6.  The Appeal Process 

A CORE who wishes to appeal a reprimand, suspension, or removal decision 
may do so in writing to his or her second level supervisor no later than 5:00 p.m. 
(the local time of the second level supervisor) on the fifth calendar day following 
the effective date of the disciplinary action. COREs included within collective 
bargaining units must follow the procedures for that unit. Oral appeals are not 
permitted. This appeal process is not applicable to non-disciplinary actions, such 
as right-sizing, demobilization, or the expiration of appointments. 

A.  The CORE may provide a narrative and any documentation that he or she 

considers relevant for the second level supervisor to consider prior to issuing 
his or her final decision. 

B.  The second level supervisor may gather additional documents that he or she 
deems necessary to make a final decision. The second level supervisor 
should complete any additional investigation within five working days of the 
receipt of a timely appeal and issue a decision within five working days after 
finishing an investigation. 

C.  The Employee Relations Specialist will review the written decision drafted by 
the second level supervisor prior to its issuance to the CORE. Additionally, 
the Employee Relations Specialist will gather and preserve any and all 
additional documents acquired by the second level supervisor to issue the 
final decision and the final decision itself. 

11-7.  Allegations of Discrimination 

If a CORE alleges discrimination to his or her supervisor, the CORE must be 
referred to the Office of Equal Rights for appropriate guidance on the EEO 
complaint process. The supervisor may contact the Office of Chief Counsel’s 
Personnel Law Branch with any questions concerning the EEO process. 

11-8.  Allegations of Fraud, Waste, Abuse, and Mismanagement 

Supervisors must not ignore allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, or 
mismanagement, and must take steps to inquire into the allegations or refer them 
to appropriate management officials for investigation. Allegations of misconduct 
against COREs at the IC-15 or equivalent level or higher must be referred to the 
Office of Inspector General (ref: DHS Management Directive 0810.1) for 
investigation. 

66 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 12:  RIGHTSIZING 

12-1.  General 

A.  COREs receive temporary appointments that do not confer eligibility or 

priority consideration for permanent appointment. They may be removed from 
Federal service at any time for poor performance, misconduct, reduction in 
work, or for other agency mission needs, so long as adequate documentation 
exists to justify the removal, and are not subject to protection afforded by 
reduction-in-force provisions or reemployment rights established under any 
statutory or regulatory provision.  

B.  When FEMA requires reductions in staff levels in one or more functional 

areas due to a lack of work or funding, FEMA may conduct a rightsizing of its 
CORE workforce. A rightsizing may occur when an Office or Directorate 
anticipates needing fewer positions through the annual workload analysis and 
staffing plan process, or if an immediate need to reduce positions or workload 
is realized between annual workload analyses. 

C.  Rightsizing results in termination of appointment prior to the expiration date of 
an appointment, unless the CORE is selected for or is reassigned to another 
vacant position in FEMA. 

D.  Rightsizing procedures should not be used to remove CORE employees due 

to poor performance or misconduct.  

E.  A Rightsizing does not occur when FEMA declines to renew a CORE’s 

appointment at the end of a CORE’s appointment term. 

F.  Program Areas shall be clearly defined, with appropriate justification, in the 

Plan. The Plan shall be in writing and approved by OCCHCO prior to 
implementation.  

12-2.  Rightsizing Plan 

A.  The second level supervisor, in coordination with OCCHCO, develops a 

Rightsizing Plan to affect the rightsizing procedures described in this Chapter 
that will impact the COREs under his or her supervisory authority. The Plan 
shall be in writing and approved by OCCHCO prior to implementation. 

B.  Based on the Office or Directorate’s most recent workload analysis and 

staffing plan, the second level supervisor will identify the activities that will 
cease to be performed or require an adjustment in the amount of time for 
performance. 

C.  Using this adjusted workload analysis, the supervisor or manager will develop 
a revised Staffing Plan for the positions under his or her authority that will 
propose the number of CORE positions by title, series, grade, and duty 
station that will continue to be needed. The remaining positions will be 
identified for rightsizing. 

67 

 
 
D.  The Rightsizing Plan will consist of the updated staffing plan, any Functional 

Area SMEs identified for retention (see section 12-4.B.), the proposed 
timeline for providing the general and specific notices of rightsizing to the 
affected COREs, and the proposed effective date of the rightsizing. 

12-3.  Notice 

The second level supervisor will issue both general and specific notice of 
upcoming rightsizing efforts. 

A.  General Advance Notice. COREs will be given a 30 calendar day advance 
official notification concerning decisions which may result in their being 
affected by a rightsizing effort. This notification will be in writing and will 
include: the reasons for the rightsizing effort, such as lack of work or funds, 
reorganization, or a realignment of functions; and, whom to contact about 
assistance available for affected employees. 

B.   Specific Notice. Specific written notice of separation will be issued to 

individual affected COREs prior to the proposed date of their release.  
FEMA’s goal is to provide notice no less than 30 calendar days from their 
date of release unless extenuating circumstances dictate a shorter notice 
period.  

12-4.  Retention Criteria 

Upon determining that rightsizing procedures are required, the second level 
supervisor, in consultation with OCCHCO, shall utilize the following criteria to 
determine the order in which COREs will be released. An incumbent will only be 
compared to other incumbents under the supervision of that second level 
supervisor. 

A.  Position. Identify (1) the affected area; (2) the existing positions staffing that 
area; and (3) pay levels within each position. Each position is reviewed and 
listed by pay and location, and positions are identified for retention based on 
lack of work or funds, reorganization, or a realignment of functions. The 
determination as to the number of needed positions to staff the reduced 
workforce must be documented in the Rightsizing Plan. 

Example. In this example, the program area is identified as “Applicant 
Services” and the existing positions are “Applicant Services Specialists.” 
There are currently 10 IC-12s, 15 IC-11s, and 15 IC-9s Applicant Services 
Specialist positions. The remaining work only requires 3 IC-12s, 10 IC-11s, 
and no IC-9s Applicant Services Specialists.11 Therefore, 7 IC-12s, 5 IC-11s, 
and all IC-9s will be released. Consequently, the second level supervisor 
must examine the incumbent IC-12s and IC-11s to determine who will fill the 

11 For this example, substitute the pay band numbers for grade level if the COREs with positions 
targeted for rightsizing are paid via an administratively-determined pay scale utilizing pay bands.

B.  Functional Area SME. To ensure accomplishment of mission objectives, the 
supervisor of a functional area subject to rightsizing procedures may identify 
one SME from the supervisor’s functional area that should be excluded from 
rightsizing procedures because of the SME’s subject matter expertise. Any 
request for a SME’s exclusion from rightsizing must be accompanied by a 
justification that establishes that a need exists for this SME position, and that 
the requested employee is most qualified for the SME position. This request 
must be approved by the supervisor’s chain of command with the final 
concurrence of the Head of the Office or Directorate, who will then inform 
OCCHCO of the SME designation and transmit to OCCHCO all documents 
justifying his or her selection. OCCHCO must review and approve the SME 
designation as part of the review of the Rightsizing Plan. A SME who is 
thereafter reassigned to a different functional area will lose his or her SME 
designation, thereby losing his or her exemption from rightsizing procedures. 

C.  Performance Evaluation. The second level supervisor will provide to 

OCCHCO the summary rating level of all COREs in positions that must be 
rightsized, based on their most recent annual performance appraisals. 
Incumbents will be released in inverse order of performance rating (lowest to 
highest). Normally, incumbents with summary rating levels of Achieved 
Excellence (or equivalent) will be excluded from release unless the total 
number of positions that must be released exceeds the number of incumbents 
who received a summary rating below Achieved Excellence (or equivalent).   

D.  Service Computation Date (SCD). If reviewing the performance evaluations 
of all COREs in positions that must be rightsized has not distinguished the 
incumbents for release from those who will be excluded from release for the 
current round of rightsizing, OCCHCO shall further review incumbents by 
SCD and shall identify those with the most recent SCDs for release.  

E.  Ties.  The official who would normally make the selection for the position from 

which the CORE is being released will determine, on the basis of 

69 

 
 
 
qualifications and competencies for the specific position, which employee(s) 
will be retained when two or more employees have identical service 
computation dates. The rationale for retention versus removal must be 
documented with the specific reasons for each decision. OCCHCO must 
review and approve the stated rationale. 

F.  Recovery Office Closure. 

1.  Some COREs will remain in their positions until the closure of the 

Recovery Office. 

2.  Upon the closure of the Recovery Office, the remaining COREs must have 

applied and been selected for a vacant FEMA position or they will be 
released from their employment with FEMA, using the notice procedures 
above. 

12-5.  Transitional Options for Released COREs 

CORE staff identified for release will not be automatically reassigned directly into 
vacant positions elsewhere in FEMA and must apply and be appointed through 
the hiring procedures identified in this Manual. COREs will be released from their 
current appointments for lack of work if, by the date of their release, they have 
not been selected for another vacant position within FEMA. The Director of the 
Recovery Office or the Head of the Office or Directorate may assist COREs 
identified for release with career transition, as appropriate, by arranging for 
assistance with resume writing and interview preparation. 

70 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 13:  ABSENCE AND LEAVE 

13-1.  Absence and Leave Policy 

FEMA administratively applies FM 3300.3, FEMA Absence and Leave Policy to 
COREs, with the exception of CORE-Is, whose absence and leave policies are 
governed by FD 010-7, Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT) Program 
Directive.  

71 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 14:  TRAINING AND ETHICS 

14-1.  Training Provisions 

A.  The CORE and his or her supervisor of record share the responsibility for 

ensuring the CORE’s professional development. 

B.  OCCHCO, Employee Development Division, is responsible for drafting 

guidance on various topics, including but not limited to, continuing service 
agreements relating participation in employee development programs, 
supervisory training, and individual and executive development plans. 

C.  A CORE may be temporarily placed on a rotational assignment as part of a 
professional development program. In such circumstances, the duties and 
responsibilities performed by the CORE must be authorized under the 
Stafford Act. A CORE may be placed on a rotational assignment for up to 120 
days that may be renewed for one additional 120 day period. As the CORE 
IMAT program maintains its own professional development program, CORE 
IMATs are not eligible for rotational assignments. 

D.  Eligibility for training programs for a CORE paid via the grades and steps 

system is determined by the applicable grade and years of service 
requirement. Eligibility for training programs for a CORE paid via the pay 
band system is determined by comparing the current salary level of the 
CORE to the salary range of the GS levels eligible for the training program 
and the years of service requirement. The CORE will be eligible for a training 
program if the CORE’s salary is within the salary range of the GS employees 
eligible for the training and satisfying the years of service requirement. 

E.  IM COREs are eligible to participate in applicable leadership development 
programs so long as the training program does not have an impact on 
mission requirements. If an IM CORE is directed to deploy during a training 
program the CORE must deploy and may not finish the training program. 

F.  COREs participating in a leadership development program will be required to 
sign and comply with the terms of a three year Continuing Service Agreement 
(CSA). See Chapter 15, Continuing Service Agreements, for more 
information. 

14-2.  Ethics Requirements  

A.  All COREs are subject to the federal ethics laws and regulations, including 

the criminal conflict of interest statutes, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Executive Branch, and any supplemental ethics regulations 
promulgated by DHS. 

1.  Federal ethics laws and regulations apply to COREs at all times and may 

affect a CORE’s ability to seek and enter into outside employment. 

2.  A CORE’s outside employment may also create a real or apparent conflict 

of interest with his or her FEMA duties. 

72 

 
 
3.  COREs must be informed of these rules and regulations prior to hiring. 

B.  All COREs shall receive training in fraud detection and prevention, equal 

rights, privacy, and security. 

C.  All COREs must complete Initial Ethics Orientation provided by OCC Ethics 

within 90 days of their date of entry, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 2638.703. 

D.  Confidential financial disclosure filers must complete one hour of annual 

ethics training per calendar year, as required by 5 C.F.R. § 2638.705.  All 
other COREs must complete annual ethics training per FEMA policy. 

E.  All annual ethics training is provided by OCC Ethics. 

73 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 15:  CONTINUING SERVICE AGREEMENTS 

15-1.  Service Agreement 

A.  An applicant or CORE who receives a recruitment, relocation, or retention 

incentive is required to sign a two-year CSA prior to receiving the incentive. 
The Selecting Official or supervisor of record will preserve a signed copy of 
the service agreement and transmit a copy to OCCHCO. 

B.  A CORE participating in a leadership development program will be required to 

sign a three-year CSA. 

C.  A CORE must fulfill the terms of the CSA, including when the appointment is 

renewed for another appointment period. 

15-2.  Terminations of a CSA 

A.  If a CORE voluntarily separates from FEMA prior to completing the service 
obligation period, to begin employment with DHS Headquarters or another 
DHS Component, the CORE must give his or her supervisor of record at least 
30 days advance notice in writing, during which time the supervisor shall 
notify OCCHCO to transfer the remaining service obligation to the gaining 
agency. If the CORE separates from the Federal service or begins 
employment with another Federal agency, the CORE will be indebted to 
FEMA for the remaining service period. 

B.  A CORE who is demoted, removed from Federal service for misconduct or 
poor performance, or receives a rating of record lower than Achieved 
Expectations or equivalent, before fulfilling the terms of a CSA will be 
indebted to the Federal Government for the remaining service period.  

C.  Repayment is not required when a CORE is involuntarily separated for 
reasons other than misconduct or poor performance, or when the 
circumstances are otherwise beyond the CORE’s control. 

D.  A CSA may be unilaterally terminated by the head of an Office or Directorate 
based solely on management needs. Examples of discretionary removals 
include, but are not limited to, rightsizings or insufficient funds to continue 
planned payments. When a removal is based on management needs, the 
employee is entitled to all payments attributable to completed service and to 
retain any portion of a payment received that is attributable to uncompleted 
service. 

15-3.  Debt Recovery 

A.  When reimbursement is required, the repayment amount will be reduced on a 

pro rata basis for the percentage of completion of the obligated service 
period. 

B.  If a CORE’s appointment is not renewed, and the CORE is not appointed to a 

different position within FEMA, recovery is waived. 

74 

 
 
 
C.  An indebted CORE may request a waiver of any debt relating to a CSA to his 
or her Office or Directorate head. The Officer or Directorate head must send 
the request along with his or her recommendation through OCCHCO to the 
Administrator, who will render a written decision. Waivers in whole or in part 
will be rare and will be based on a determination that the recovery would be 
against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest.

Foreword 

This Manual provides guidance and policy direction for the administration, 
implementation, and oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
(FEMA) Absence and Leave Program.  

FEMA’s absence and leave rules are an important tool to recruit and retain a highly 
skilled and motivated workforce. Employees are encouraged to make full use of their 
earned leave for rest and relaxation, recuperation from sicknesses or injuries, meeting 
the health and wellness needs of family members, and to fulfill civic obligations. 

FEMA’s leave benefits are determined by laws, regulations, and executive orders 
governing the leave system for Federal employees. Some of the applicable laws, 
regulations, and executive orders give FEMA discretion to authorize certain leave 
benefits, in whole or in part, this Manual details FEMA’s decision on exercising its 
discretion regarding the application of leave benefits. This Manual provides a complete 
listing of all types of leave authorized by FEMA’s absence and leave rules. 

While FEMA supports employees utilizing all forms of leave authorized by this policy, 
managers and employees must ensure the proper use of leave. Excessive use of leave 
has a detrimental effect on FEMA and the Federal service by delaying or preventing 
FEMA’s mission objectives, increasing the work assignments for other employees, and 
providing reduced or unsatisfactory service to the public. FEMA’s leave rules are 
designed to balance the needs of FEMA, employees, and the public.

1-5.  Policy 

A.  FEMA will utilize the discretion afforded by Federal absence and leave laws, 
regulations, and policies to limit the categories and use of leave to balance 
the needs of FEMA to complete its assigned missions with recruiting and 
retaining a highly skilled and motivated workforce. 

B.  FEMA must be ready at all times to respond to all disasters and meet the 

needs of the public with the necessary workforce. 

C.  Managers and supervisors will implement FEMA’s absence and leave policies 

in a fair and consistent manner. 

D.  Employees are required to report to work on time according to their approved 
work schedules and be available during FEMA’s core business hours to 
complete assignments, respond to co-workers, and meet the needs of the 
public. 

E.  Employees are encouraged to make use of their leave privileges for rest, 

relaxation, accomplishing personal business, seeking health or medical care, 
and recovering from sicknesses and injuries. Providing effective leave options 

7 

 
 
allows FEMA to recruit and retain high quality employees, increase employee 
engagement, and improve morale. 

F.  FEMA offers a variety of leave options and workplace flexibilities to allow 

employees to satisfy their work responsibilities and meet the needs of family 
members due to illnesses, injuries, and childbirth. 

G.  FEMA supports employees fulfilling their military commitments when called to 
active service. FEMA will make every effort to support veterans returning to 
civilian life and/or seeking treatment for service related injuries and illnesses 
through the absence and leave program. 

H.  Employees will use legitimately earned leave appropriately according to the 

policies and procedures detailed by this Manual. Employees and supervisors 
will be mindful of the effect improper use of leave has on FEMA’s ability to 
complete its mission, fellow employees, and public perception of the Federal 
service.

14 

 
 
 
 
 
SCHEDULING OF WORK AND LEAVE 

2-1.  Attendance 

FEMA has core business hours from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm (see FM 106-1-1, 
Scheduling of Work). Employee work schedules must include FEMA’s core 
business hours. Employees are expected to report for work on time and to be on 
duty at all times during their regularly scheduled tour of duty except during lunch 
periods and approved absences. 

2-2.  Lunch or Meal Breaks 

Employees who work at least five consecutive hours are entitled to take an 
unpaid 30-minute lunch or meal break. Employee work schedules include a 30-
minute unpaid lunch or meal break during which employees are not permitted to 
work. The unpaid lunch or meal break may be extended up to an additional 30 
minutes at the discretion and permission of the supervisor, if the employee 
extends his or her workday by a corresponding amount. Employees may not take 
their lunch or meal break at the start or end of their work schedule. 

2-3.  Tardiness 

A.  Periods of tardiness may be approved after the tardiness occurs by the 

employee’s supervisor. Normally, annual leave or LWOP will be charged, in 
multiples of 15 minutes to cover such periods of tardiness. In rare instances 
of infrequent, unavoidable tardiness, the supervisor may excuse tardiness 
which does not exceed 30 minutes in a situation where an excused absence 
is warranted. 

B.  If the conditions or frequency of the tardiness do not warrant approval of 

leave, the tardiness may be charged to Absence Without Leave, in multiples 
of 15 minutes, to cover the period of absence. 

C.  Employees will not be required to work during these periods of leave. 

Normally, leave for the balance of the 15 minutes will be taken immediately 
following the tardiness. It may be taken later in the day, however, if more 
convenient to the office. This leave will not, however, be carried over beyond 
the day in which the tardiness occurs. 

D.  Repeated tardiness is a basis for disciplinary action. Please contact 

OCCHCO, Labor and Employee Relations for advice and assistance on 
disciplinary actions. 

2-4.  Reporting for Duty Mission Ready 

Employees must report to work mission ready. Employees who are issued FEMA 
equipment, such as laptops, PIV cards, and telephones, that is necessary to 
perform their duties, must report to their designated worksite with such 

15 

 
 
 
 
equipment according to their authorized duty schedule. If an employee reports to 
work without a piece of necessary equipment, the employee shall use accrued 
annual leave, credit hours, or compensatory time to retrieve the equipment. In 
lieu of using paid leave, supervisors may approve LWOP if the employee does 
not have accrued leave. In all cases, employees shall not be granted 
administrative leave with pay to retrieve missing equipment. If an employee does 
not report to work as scheduled on a reoccurring basis, the supervisor should 
consult with the servicing Employee Relations Specialist for guidance on how to 
account for the time needed to retrieve missing equipment and any other 
disciplinary options. 

2-5.  Requests for Leave or Approved Absence 

An employee who wishes to take leave is required to inform his/her supervisor in 
advance of the request. Employees should provide their supervisors with as 
much advanced notice as possible for leave requests. An employee who is 
unable to provide advance notice and finds themselves unable to report for duty 
shall notify his or her supervisor as soon as possible at the beginning of the work 
day to request leave. The request should include the day(s), what type of leave, 
the number of hours, and the specific hours (from-to) and be documented in 
WebTA. Note: Leave may not be approved, so it is in the interest of the 
employee to request leave with as much notice as possible. 

2-6.  Deployment Availability 

FEMA seeks to effectively and fairly deploy necessary personnel in response to 
disasters and other emergencies. To ensure sufficient personnel are available for 
deployments, heads of Offices and Directorates should plan to have at least 
seventy-five percent of their full-time employees with IM or IS titles deployed or 
available to deploy at all times.  

2-7.  Use of Leave 

FEMA encourages employees to make full use of their legitimate leave rights. 
While the accrual of leave is an employee benefit, the use of leave is subject to 
the specific requirements contained in applicable laws, regulations, and this 
Manual. Both the needs of the employee and the need to accomplish FEMA’s 
mission will be considered in arriving at decisions to approve or disapprove leave 
requests. Employees are not to abuse their leave rights and privileges. Abuse 
may be the basis for disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

2-8.  Compensatory Time Off 

An employee may choose to receive compensatory time off in lieu of payment for 
an equal amount of irregular or occasional overtime hours worked. See FEMA 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
Premium Pay Manual 253-2-1 for more information on earning compensatory 
time off.  

A.  Compensatory time must be used in 15-minute increments. 

B.  Compensatory time off must be used within 26 pay periods of the pay period 

in which it was earned. 

C.  Compensatory time off must be used prior to using annual leave, except after 

pay period 18 when employees must schedule annual leave subject to 
forfeiture. 

2-9.  Compensatory Time Off for Travel 

Employees receive compensatory time off for time spent in travel status that is 
not otherwise compensable as hours of work. See FEMA Premium Pay 253-2-1, 
5 C.F.R. Part 550 Subpart N Compensatory Time Off for Travel for more 
information on earning requirements. 

A.  Compensatory time off for travel must be used in 15 minute increments. 

B.  Compensatory time off for travel must be used within 26 pay periods of the 

pay period in which it was earned.  

C.  If an employee separates from FEMA or the Federal service, any unused 

compensatory time off for travel is forfeited. 

2-10.  Absences for Disabled Veterans 

A.  A disabled veteran shall be granted annual leave, sick leave, or LWOP, as 
requested to seek medical treatment connected with a service injury (see 
Executive Order 5396). The veteran must present an official statement from a 
medical authority that such treatment is required. The veteran must give prior 
notice of definite days and hours of absence required for medical treatment in 
order that arrangements may be made for carrying on the work during his/her 
absence. 

B.  Effective November 5, 2016, an employee who is a veteran with a service-

connected disability rated at 30 percent or more will be entitled to receive up 
to 104 hours of leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for the 
disability during the first 12-month period of employment, beginning on the 
first day of employment with the Federal government. Any leave credited to 
an employee under this section that is not used during the 12-month period, 
may not be carried over and will be forfeited. The employee must submit an 
official statement from a health care provider that the leave will be used for 
treating the service-connected disability. 

17 

 
 
 
 
2-11.  Accommodation for Religious Exercise 

To the extent that modifications to an employee’s work schedule do not interfere 
with the efficient accomplishment of FEMA’s mission, Federal Law requires 
agencies to accommodate employees’ exercise of their religion unless such 
accommodation would impose undue hardship on the conduct of FEMA’s 
operation. The granting of accrued, accumulated, or advance annual leave (if 
other requirements on the advancement of leave are met) can be used to 
accommodate a requested absence for religious observance. Other options 
include alternative work schedules used within the requesting employee’s 
organization or compensatory time off for religious observances covered in 5 
C.F.R. 550.1002 and FM 253-2-1, Premium Pay, February 11, 2014. 

2-12.  Absence Without Leave 

When an employee fails to report for duty without prior approval or has an 
unauthorized absence from the workplace during the work day, he or she may be 
charged with Absence Without Leave (AWOL). 

An AWOL charge, the failure to follow appropriate leave procedures, or the 
failure to follow instructions that result in an AWOL charge may serve as the 
basis for corrective or disciplinary action when appropriate.  

Supervisors are required to properly and accurately document any periods of 
AWOL for employees under their supervision and to initiate disciplinary action, if 
warranted. Supervisors should maintain records and documentation of all periods 
of AWOL charged to their employees. At a minimum, the records should reflect 
the dates, times, and reasons for the AWOL charge and any verbal or written 
counseling which may have occurred. AWOL is charged in 15 minute increments. 

An employee charged with AWOL on the workdays before and after a holiday will 
not receive holiday pay for the holiday. An employee charged with AWOL on the 
workday before or after a holiday will receive holiday pay for the holiday, if 
excused from duty on the holiday and in a pay status on the workday before or 
after the holiday. 

If the employee provides administratively acceptable documentation to support 
an absence charged as AWOL, and the employee’s supervisor accepts the 
justification for the absence, the charge to AWOL may be changed to an 
approved leave category. If an AWOL charge is changed to an approved 
absence, a charge of AWOL cannot serve as the basis for corrective or 
disciplinary action. However, supervisors may still take corrective or disciplinary 
action for failing to follow appropriate leave procedures. 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
3-1.  Use of Annual Leave 

ANNUAL LEAVE 

A.  Employees may use annual leave for vacations, rest and relaxation, family 

needs, personal business, emergencies not covered by sick leave, and other 
activities. 

B.  Employees may request the use of annual leave for instances generally 
covered by sick leave. Employees can use annual leave for sick leave 
purposes when an employee has an insufficient amount of sick leave to cover 
an absence or when an employee is trying to build up his or her leave 
balance. Employees may be required to provide “administratively acceptable” 
medical documentation when substituting annual leave for sick leave. 

C.  Employees should not assume that having projected “use or lose” annual 
leave near the end of the leave year requires that management approve 
requests to use the projected “use or lose” annual leave. 

D.  Managers, supervisors, and leave approving officials maintain the discretion 
to approve when annual leave is taken based on the needs and workload of 
the organizational unit. Designated management officials will notify an 
employee in writing when a request for annual leave has been denied. 

3-2.  Earning Rates for Annual Leave 

A.  Employees accrue annual leave based on length of creditable Federal service 

or type of appointment. 

B.  Employees must be in a pay status for at least a portion of a pay period to 

earn annual leave for that pay period. If an employee is in a non-pay status 
(i.e., LWOP, including LWOP pending a disability claim), for an entire pay 
period, the employee will not accrue annual leave.  

C.  If an employee resigns or is separated from Federal service prior to the last 
workday of a pay period, the employee will not accrue annual leave for that 
pay period. 

D.  Full-time General Schedule (GS), CORE, and wage grade employees will 

accrue annual leave at the following rates: 

1.  Employees with less than 3 years of service earn 4 hours each full 

biweekly pay period. 

2.  Employees with 3 but less than 15 years of service earn 6 hours each full 

biweekly pay period, except for the last full pay period of the calendar year 
when they earn 10 hours. 

3.  Employees with 15 or more years of service earn 8 hours each full 

biweekly pay period. 

E.  Full-time employees who hold Senior Executive Service (SES), Senior-Level 
(SL), or Scientific or Professional (ST) positions will accrue eight (8) hours of 

19 

 
 
annual leave each full biweekly pay period. 

F.  Part-time GS, CORE, and wage grade employees will accrue annual leave at 

the following rates: 

1.  Employees with less than three years of service earn 1 hour for each 20 

hours in a pay status. 

2.  Employees with 3 years but less than 15 years of service earn 1 hour for 

each 13 hours in a pay status. 

3.  Employees with 15 or more years of service earn 1 hour for each 10 hours 

in a pay status. 

G.  Employees with uncommon tours of duty will accrue annual leave at the 

following rates: 

1.  Employees with less than three years of service earn 4 hours times the 
average number of hours worked in the bi-weekly pay period divided by 
80. 

2.  Employees with 3 years but less than 15 years of service earn 6 hours 
times the average number of hours worked in the bi-weekly pay period 
divided by 80. 

3.  Employees with 15 or more years of service earn 8 hours times the 

average number of hours worked in the bi-weekly pay period divided by 
80. 

3-3.  Advancing Annual Leave 

A.  The provisions for advancing annual leave apply only to employees whose 
continued employment is contemplated. Any request for advance annual 
leave must be made to the supervisor in writing, in advance of anticipated 
usage by the employee. 

B.  Employees may be advanced no more than the amount of annual leave to be 

earned in the remainder of the leave year. 

C.  The decision on whether to advance annual leave should be based on such 
considerations as the employee's reason for requesting it, workload status, 
and the interests of FEMA. 

D.  Upon return to active duty status from a period of extended annual leave, the 
employee must repay the advance annual leave during the period of his or 
her continued employment. The advance annual leave may be liquidated by 
subsequently earned annual leave. If an employee separates from the 
Federal service with a negative leave balance, the employee will be indebted 
to the Federal government for the remaining value of the advanced leave. 

20 

 
 
 
3-4.  Maximum Accumulation of Annual Leave 

A.  The maximum accumulation of annual leave which may be carried into a new 
leave year for most employees is 30 days (240 hours). However, there are 
some exceptions to the 30 day maximum accumulation for employees 
stationed outside the Unites States. These limited exceptions are covered in 5 
U.S.C. 6304 (b). 

B.  The maximum accumulation for employees in the Senior Executive Service 

(SES) is 90 days (720 hours). 

3-5.  Scheduling Annual Leave to Allow Potential Restoration 

Any annual in excess of the maximum leave ceiling will be forfeited at the end of 
the leave year. Leave scheduled and approved before the third biweekly pay 
period prior to the end of the leave year that cannot be taken, may be restored if 
the leave could not be taken due to exigencies of public business (determined by 
an appropriate authority), illness, or administrative error. Leave scheduled prior 
to this deadline may be restored only if the conditions in section 3-6 are met. 
Each year the OCCHCO issues a notice to inform employees of the pertinent 
deadlines, the final date to schedule leave, and the final date of the leave year. 
Employees are encouraged to request all leave as early as practicable. 

3-6.  Restoration of Annual Leave 

A.  If annual leave scheduled and approved prior to the third biweekly pay period 

prior to the end of the leave year is forfeited, it can be restored for the 
employee's later use only for the following reasons: 

1.  Exigencies of the public business which are approved by the head of an 

Office or Directorate at the time the exigency occurs; 

2.  Sickness; or 

3.  Administrative error which results in the loss of annual leave otherwise 

accruable. 

B.  In order for the head of an Office or Directorate to approve the cancellation of 
properly scheduled and approved annual leave because of "exigencies of the 
public business," the following conditions must exist: 

1.  There must have been no reasonable alternative to canceling leave for the 
particular employee in order to meet the work exigency (i.e., the work 
could not have been postponed, handled, or managed in another way, or 
performed by some other employee); and 

2.  There must have been specific beginning and ending dates of the critical 
work assignment, project, etc., that resulted in the cancellation of the 
scheduled leave. 

C.  Employees who forfeit annual leave as a result of any of the conditions above 

21 

 
 
 
may request restoration by sending a memorandum through their supervisor 
to the appropriate Office or Directorate head. Requests must be timely made 
following the end of the leave year, and must clearly state why the leave was 
forfeited. The employee must submit documentation showing the previously 
approved leave and a supervisor's memorandum explaining why it was 
necessary to cancel the leave. 

D.  When restoration is warranted, a memorandum stating it is warranted signed 

by the head of the Office or Directorate, or designee, will be sent to the 
employee with a copy forwarded to the OCCHCO for accounting purposes. 
Restored annual leave is maintained in a separate leave account. 

E.  Restored annual leave must be used not later than the end of the leave year 

ending two years after: 

1.  The date of restoration for leave forfeited because of administrative error; 

2.  A date fixed by FEMA management as the termination of the exigency; or 

3.  The date the employee is determined to be recovered and able to return to 

duty. 

4.  Restored annual leave that is not used within this time period cannot be 

restored again. 

3-7.  Annual Leave to Establish Retirement Eligibility 

An employee may use annual leave to qualify for retirement eligibility if the 
employee is subject to separation through a reduction-in-force, transfer of 
function, or when an employee declines to relocate to a different commuting 
area. An employee may use all accumulated, accrued, and restored annual leave 
to the employee’s credit prior to the effective date of the reduction-in-force, 
transfer of function, or relocation, as well as any annual leave earned after the 
effective date of the reduction-in-force, transfer of function, or relocation. An 
employee may not use advanced annual leave after the effective date of the 
reduction-in-force or transfer of function to establish retirement eligibility. 

3-8.  Terminal Leave 

Terminal leave is annual leave taken at the conclusion of a period of service and 
immediately before separation or retirement without the employee returning to 
duty. FEMA may not grant an employee terminal leave immediately prior to 
separation from the Federal service when it is known in advance that the 
employee will separate. If an employee does not return to duty from a period of 
annual leave, the employee’s last day on duty will be considered the effective 
date of separation (see Comp. Gen Opinion B-223876 dated June 12, 1987). 

An exception to this rule will be made for employees involuntarily separated 
because of a reduction-in-force or a transfer of function. In such cases, an 
employee may elect to use accrued annual leave to remain in service after the 

22 

 
 
 
date the employee would otherwise have been separated if, and only to the 
extent that, such additional service credit will enable the employee to qualify for 
an immediate retirement annuity or to qualify for health benefits coverage into 
retirement. 

3-9.  Lump Sum Payment of Annual Leave 

A.  When an employee separates from the Federal service, the employee will 
receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated and current accrued unused 
annual leave. The lump-sum payment will equal the pay the employee would 
have received if the employee remained in the Federal service and exhausted 
the amount of accumulated annual leave (holidays are counted as workdays 
in projecting the lump-sum leave period). The lump-sum payment period will 
not extend an employee’s service period. (See 5 U.S.C. § 5551 and 5 C.F.R. 
Part 550, subpart L). 

B.  The employee’s lump-sum payment is calculated by multiplying the number of 
hours of accumulated and accrued annual leave by the employee’s applicable 
hourly rate of pay. The following types of pay are included in the lump-sum 
payment calculations (See 5 C.F.R. § 550.1205): 

1.  Rate of basic pay; 

2.  Locality pay or other similar geographic adjustments; 

3.  Any statutory adjustments in pay or any general system-wide increases 
that become effective during the lump-sum period (FEMA will adjust the 
lump-sum payment to reflect the increased rate on and after the effective 
date of the pay adjustment); 

4.  A within-grade increase if the employee meets the requirements for an 

increase prior to the date the employee becomes eligible for a lump-sum 
payment; 

5.  Premium pay to the extent such premium pay was payable to the 

employee: 

i.  Night differential at the applicable rate for a prevailing rate employee 

for all regularly scheduled periods of night shift duty; 

ii.  Premium pay if the employee received premium pay for the pay period 
immediately prior to the date the employee became eligible for a lump-
sum payment, subject to any salary caps; 

iii.  Overtime pay for overtime work that is regularly scheduled during an 

employee’s established uncommon tour of duty (the uncommon tour of 
duty must be applicable for the pay period immediately prior to the date 
the employee became eligible for a lump-sum payment); 

6.  A supervisory differential (if applicable);  

7.  Non-foreign area cost-of-living allowance and/or post differentials; and 

23 

 
 
8.  A post allowance if the employee’s official duty station is in a foreign area. 

C.  If an employee is called to active military duty in the armed forces, the 

employee is entitled to (see 5 U.S.C. § 5552): 

1.  Receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated and current accrued 

annual leave in accordance with this section; or 

2.  Elect to have the annual leave remain to his or her credit until returning 

from active duty. 

24 

 
 
 
 
SICK LEAVE 

4-1.  Use of Sick Leave 

A.  FEMA must grant sick leave to an employee, subject to exceptions listed in 

section 4-5 Abuse of Sick Leave Privileges, when an employee: 

1.  Receives medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; 

2.  Is incapacitated from the performance of position duties by physical or 

mental illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; 

3.  Provides care for a family member who is incapacitated by a medical or 

mental condition, or attends to a family member receiving medical, dental, 
or optical examination or treatment; 

4.  Provides care for a family member with a serious health condition; 

5.  Makes arrangements funeral arrangements or attends the funeral of a 

family member; 

6.  Would, because of communicable disease, jeopardize the health of other 
employees and/or the general public by being on the job (when there is 
uncertainty as to whether a particular ailment meets the definition of a 
"communicable disease" and it is not addressed by local health 
regulations, the employee should be asked to provide a statement from 
the patient's physician that the ailment is contagious. This statement 
should contain the period of time for which the patient must be confined or 
isolated); or 

7.  Must be absent from work for adoption-related activities (e.g., 

appointments with adoption agencies, social workers and attorneys, court 
proceedings, required travel, periods of time adoptive parents are required 
by court or agency to care for the adopted child.). 

B.  Full-time employees may use a total of 12 weeks (480 hours) of sick leave 
per year to care for a family member with a serious health condition. For a 
part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, an 
employee may use 12 times the average number of hours in his or her 
scheduled tour of duty each week to care for a member with a serious health 
condition. 

C.  Part-time employees are covered by the regulation, but their sick-leave 

benefits are pro-rated. For instance, a part-time employee who works 20 
hours a week, could use 20 hours of sick leave or from 21 to 240 hours if they 
maintained a sick leave balance of at least 40 hours. 

4-2.  Earning Rates for Sick Leave 

Earning of sick leave is not affected by length of service. Full-time employees 
earn sick leave at a rate of 4 hours for each full biweekly pay period. Part-time 
employees with an established tour of duty earn sick leave at a rate of 1 hour for 

25 

 
 
each 20 hours of duty they are in pay status (with a maximum of 4 hours of sick 
leave per pay period). Employees are not limited in the amount of sick leave they 
may accumulate and carryover from one year to the next. 

4-3.  Requesting Sick Leave 

Employees should request sick leave to attend medical appointments as soon as 
possible after the appointment is scheduled or when they are reasonably certain 
of the time an appointment will be made. Except for emergencies, employees 
must request advance approval of sick leave for medical, dental, or optical 
examinations or treatment. Employees who are unable to report for duty because 
of personal illness or injury will notify the supervisors as soon as possible. 
Normally, an employee shall notify their supervisor according to the procedures 
established by his or her supervisor or applicable bargaining agreement at the 
onset of an illness or injury. The employee will provide the supervisor with an 
estimate of the time that he or she expects to be absent because of the illness. If 
the employee expects to deviate from the previously approved estimate of time 
for sick leave, the employee will contact the supervisor. Failure to properly notify 
the supervisor of the use of sick leave or an incapacitation can lead to the 
placement of an employee in an AWOL status or other disciplinary measures. 

4-4.  Medical Certificates 

Employees are required to provide “administratively acceptable” evidence to their 
supervisor when requesting sick leave. Normally, the only thing needed to satisfy 
this requirement is an employee’s certification as to the reason for the absence.  
However, for an absence in excess of three workdays (or for shorter absences 
where there are reasonable suspicions about the circumstances of the leave or 
where it is unclear whether the employee is totally incapacitated for duty), 
supervisors may require an employee who misses work to submit a doctor’s 
certification of the medical reason for the leave or other satisfactory evidence as 
to the reason for the absence. If a supervisor has a reasonable basis to suspect 
an employee is abusing sick leave, the employee may be required to support all 
incidences of sick leave with a medical certificate regardless of duration. The 
employee must provide the required certification within a reasonable amount of 
time. Unapproved sick leave may be charged to annual leave or as AWOL. 

4-5.  Abuse of Sick Leave Privileges 

Sick leave abuse can create morale problems with other employees who are 
forced to cover for absent employees and also costs FEMA in terms of both 
excessive and unwarranted leave payments and lost productivity.  

Each supervisor should periodically review the sick leave records of employees 
who show a pattern of repeated sick leave. An employee whose record is 
questionable may be required to submit a medical certificate in support of any 

26 

 
 
 
 
future absence, regardless of length, for which a request for sick leave is made. 
An employee who misuses sick leave may receive a charge to AWOL which may 
result in disciplinary action. 

4-6.  Advancing Sick Leave 

A.  An employee may, at the supervisor’s discretion, be granted sick leave in 

advance of accrual in the event of serious disability or ailment, defined as one 
which usually lasts for at least 3 consecutive work days and is supported by a 
medical certificate. 

B.  A supervisor should not advance sick leave to an employee when it is known 
(or reasonably expected) that the employee will not return to duty (e.g., when 
the employee has applied for disability retirement). 

C.  Supervisors should consider the need for the employee’s service, the 

expectation of a return to duty, the employee’s history of leave usage, and the 
availability of other leave, such as annual leave or LWOP, in their 
determinations.  

D.  The maximum amount of sick leave that may be granted to a requesting full 

time employee is 240 hours, and will be restricted to: 

1.  An employee who is incapacitated for the performance of duties by 

physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; 

2.  For a serious health condition of the employee or a family member; 

3.  When an employee would jeopardize the health of others with his or her 
presence on the job because of exposure to a communicable disease; 

4.  For purposes relating to the adoption of a child; or 

5.  For the care of a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if 
the employee is exercising an entitlement right under 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(3). 

E.  FEMA may, at the supervisor’s discretion, advance up to 104 hours to a full-

time employee: 

1.  For medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; 

2.  To provide care for a family member who is incapacitated by a medical or 
mental condition, or to attend to a family member receiving medical, 
dental, or optical examination or treatment; 

3.  To provide care for a family member who would jeopardize the health of 
others by that family member’s presence because of exposure to a 
communicable disease; or 

4.  To make arrangements necessitated by the death of a family member or 

to attend the funeral of a family member. 

F.  The maximum amount of sick leave FEMA may advance to part-time 

employees is prorated by the number of hours in the employee’s regularly 

27 

 
 
scheduled administrative workweek. 

G.  The maximum amount of advanced sick leave that an employee may have on 
balance at any time, no matter the reason for the leave, is 240 hours. For 
example, if an employee is given 104 hours of advanced sick leave in order to 
make funeral arrangements for a family member in July, and requests 240 
hours of advanced sick leave for a serious health condition that requires 
treatment in August, the employee will only be able to receive 136 hours of 
advanced leave to treat their serious health condition. 

H.  Sick leave may be advanced only if an employee has exhausted his or her 

annual leave or compensatory time off balance. 

I.  Employees may not be advanced sick leave during a period of active military 

duty. 

J.  Employees cannot be advanced sick leave for care of a covered service 

member, unless the employee invokes FMLA to care for the covered service 
member. 

K.  Advance sick leave should not be granted to a probationary employee beyond 
what the employee would be expected to earn during the probationary period 
until the supervisor has had an opportunity to reach a decision about the 
employee's continued employment. 

L.  When an employee who is indebted for advanced sick leave separates from 
Federal Service, he or she is required to refund the amount of advanced sick 
leave or the agency may deduct that amount from any pay due to the 
employee upon separation, and then proceed to reclaim the remaining 
balance. 

M.  When an employee who has been advanced sick leave leaves FEMA without 

having made up the balance of advance leave, the supervisor must 
immediately call the OCCHCO to report that the employee will be resigning 
from the Federal Government. The supervisor is then required to send a 
follow-up letter to the payroll office.  

N.  Once an advance has been granted, further use of sick leave constitutes an 
additional advance and must meet all the criteria of this section before it can 
be approved. If an employee cannot be granted additional advanced sick 
leave or the employee is not approved for an additional advance of sick leave, 
absences due to illnesses must be charged to annual leave or LWOP. 

O.  Upon return to active duty status from a period of extended sick leave, the 

employee must repay the advance sick leave during the period of his or her 
continued employment. The advance of sick leave may be liquidated by 
subsequently earned sick leave. The employee may also choose to liquidate 
the indebtedness by a charge against annual leave (provided this action is not 
for the purpose of avoiding a forfeiture of annual leave at the end of the leave 
year), or by a charge against annual leave received by the employee as an 
approved leave recipient. The employee may arrange to pay for advanced 
annual or sick leave in cash at any time if such an arrangement is approved 

28 

 
by OCCHCO. 

P.  Indebtedness related to advance sick leave is waived for employees 
approved for disability retirement and for deceased employees. 

4-7.  Substitution of Sick Leave for Annual Leave 

When sickness occurs within a period of annual leave, an employee may be 
granted sick leave for the period of illness, provided the employee notifies his/her 
supervisor within a reasonable period of time, within one pay period, to request 
sick leave via WebTA. In circumstances in which it is unclear whether the 
employee is incapacitated, FEMA may request more information or medical 
documentation, as appropriate prior to approving the substitution. 

4-8.  Sick Leave Used in the Computation of an Annuity 

If an employee retires from the Federal service on an immediate annuity or dies 
leaving a survivor entitled to an annuity, any unused sick leave will be used in the 
calculation of the employee’s or survivor’s annuity. Sick leave used to calculate 
an annuity will be charged against the employee’s sick leave account and may 
not thereafter be used, transferred, or recredited. All sick leave in the employee’s 
sick leave account on the date of his or her retirement or death, will be credited 
towards the annuity calculation and will be considered used. 

4-9.  Records on the Use of Sick Leave 

FEMA must maintain records of the amount of sick leave used by an employee 
for family care purposes and to make arrangements for or attend the funeral of a 
family member under section 630.401(a)(3) and (4). The records must be 
sufficient to ensure an employee does not exceed the limitations in section 
630.401(b) and (c). 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
5-1.  Leave Entitlement 

FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT 

The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take up to 
12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave in certain situations. Employees 
who take unpaid leave through FMLA will be returned to their same or equivalent 
position at the end of the period of leave, with the same benefits, pay, status, and 
other conditions of employment. Employees interested in taking leave under 
FMLA should discuss their leave plans with their supervisor as early as possible 
to ensure the employee’s leave request is allowable under FMLA and an orderly 
transfer of duties and responsibilities during the employee’s absence. 

A.  An employee is entitled to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid 

leave during any 12 month period for one of the following purposes: 

1.  The birth of a son or daughter of the employee and the care of such son or 

daughter; 

2.  The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or 

foster care; 

3.  The care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee with a 

serious health condition; 

4.  In response to a serious health condition of the employee who is unable to 
perform any one or more of the essential functions of his or her position; 
or 

5.  Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, 
son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on covered active 
duty (or has received notice to be called to active duty) in the Armed 
Forces (see 5 C.F.R. § 630.1204 for more information). 

B.  An employee (or an employee’s representative) must invoke his or her right to 
take leave under FMLA before taking leave. An employee cannot retroactively 
invoke his or her right to take leave under FMLA, unless the employee is 
mentally or physically incapable of providing notice of his or her intent to take 
FMLA leave during the entire time the employee is absent from duty. In such 
cases, the employee may be required to provide documentation explaining 
the employee’s and/or representative’s inability to notify FEMA of the 
employee’s absence. A supervisor may ask an employee if it is his or her 
intent to invoke his or her FMLA protection when he or she is requesting 
qualifying leave. 

C.  The 12 month period begins on the date an employee first takes leave under 
FMLA. An employee is not entitled to an additional 12 weeks of FMLA leave 
until the previous 12 month period ends and the employee experiences an 
event that will entitle the employee to leave under FMLA. 

D.  The 12 administrative workweeks of leave are based on the employee’s 

regularly scheduled workweek. The 12 administrative workweeks of leave 

30 

 
equals 12 times the average number of hours in the employee’s regularly 
scheduled administrative workweek.  

5-2.  Applicability and Eligibility 

A.  Permanent employees and employees serving under a temporary 

appointment of more than one year are covered by the regulations under 5 
C.F.R. Part 630, Subpart L. 

1.  Employees must have at least 12 months of Federal service with a regular 

tour of duty to receive the protections and benefits under FMLA. 

2.  The service does not need to be continuous. 

3.  Service under temporary appointments of one year or less or on an 
intermittent duty basis does not count towards meeting the eligibility 
requirement. 

B.  Employees who do not have a scheduled tour of duty (i.e., employees with an 

intermittent duty schedule) and employees serving under a temporary 
appointment of one year or less are covered by the regulations under 29 
C.F.R. Part 825 (see FD 010-6, FEMA Reservist Program, June 14, 2012). 

1.  Employees must have at least 12 months of Federal service. 

2.  The service does not need to be continuous. 

3.  The employee must have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the 
previous 12 months prior to the period for which FMLA is to be used. 

5-3.  Serious Health Condition 

A.  FMLA allows employees to take up to 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid 
leave for serious health conditions. A serious health condition under FMLA 
means an illness, injury, impairment, or other physical or mental condition that 
involves inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay in a hospital), or continuing 
treatment by a health care provider. Continuing treatment by a health care 
provider may include one or more of the following: 

1.  A period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days (including 
any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same 
condition) that also involves: 

i.  Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, or by a 

provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by a 
health care provider; or 

ii.  Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which 
results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of 
the health care provider (e.g., a course of prescription medication or 
therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health 
condition); 

31 

 
 
 
2.  Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or pre-natal care, even if the 
affected individual does not receive active treatment from a health care 
provider during the period of incapacity or the period of incapacity does 
not last more than three consecutive calendar days; 

3.  A chronic serious condition requiring treatment by a health care provider 

that continues over an extended period of time which may cause episodic 
rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, 
epilepsy); 

4.  Permanent or long-term conditions requiring supervision by a health care 

provider; 

5.  Multiple treatments for non-chronic conditions. 

B.  Employees may not use FMLA for routine or minor medical appointments or 
illnesses. Employees may use sick leave in response to short-term, routine, 
or other minor health conditions (see chapter 4). Employees may not use 
FMLA for the following purposes: 

1.  Routine physical, eye, or dental examinations; 

2.  A regimen of continuing treatment involving over-the-counter medications, 
bed-rest, exercise, or other similar activities that can be initiated without a 
visit to a health care provider; 

3.  Voluntary cosmetic surgery, unless inpatient care is required or 

complications develop; 

4.  Absences due to an employee’s use of an illegal substance, unless the 
employee is receiving treatment for substance abuse by or on referral 
from a health care provider; 

5.  The common cold, the flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, 

headaches, routine dental or orthodontia problems, and periodontal 
disease, unless complications arise; or 

6.  Allergies, restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury, removal of 
cancerous growth, or mental illness resulting from stress may be serious 
health conditions only if such conditions require inpatient care or 
continuing treatment by a health care provider. 

5-4.  Notice to Take Leave 

If the need to take leave under FMLA is foreseeable (i.e., expected childbirth, 
adoption, foster care, or planned medical procedure), the employee (or the 
employee’s representative) shall notify his or her supervisor at least 30 calendar 
days before the start of the planned leave. If the need for the leave is 
unforeseeable, and the employee cannot provide a full 30 calendar days’ notice, 
the employee shall notify his or her supervisor as soon as practical. If the need 
for the leave is foreseeable, and the employee fails to provide sufficient notice 
with no reasonable excuse, the employee’s supervisor may require the employee 

32 

 
 
to delay taking leave under FMLA until the employee provides at least 30 
calendar days’ notice.  

5-5. 

Intermittent or Reduced Leave Schedule 

An employee may take intermittent FMLA leave or reduced leave for the birth of 
a son or daughter, the care of a newborn son or daughter, or the placement of a 
son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care with the approval 
of the employee’s supervisor. An employee may take intermittent FMLA leave or 
reduced leave for the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent  with a serious 
health condition, or in response to the employee’s own serious health condition 
when medically necessary. If an employee invokes FMLA on an intermittent or 
reduced leave schedule for a serious health condition, FEMA may place the 
employee in an alternate position that can accommodate the employee’s leave 
schedule (see 5 C.F.R. § 620.1205). 

5-6.  Substitution of Paid Leave 

Once an employee invokes his or her right to leave under FMLA, an employee 
may substitute future scheduled periods of unpaid leave with paid leave (i.e., an 
employee may not retroactively substitute paid leave for unpaid leave). An 
employee may substitute annual leave, sick leave, advanced annual leave, 
advanced sick leave, or any donated leave under the Voluntary Leave Transfer 
Program. An employee may not be forced to substitute paid leave for LWOP. An 
employee may not substitute compensatory time or credit hours for unpaid leave. 
If an employee substitutes paid sick leave for unpaid leave, the normal rules for 
using sick leave apply (i.e., an employee cannot use sick leave to bond with a 
newborn child).  

5-7.  Medical Certification and Supporting Documentation 

If an employee invokes his or her right to unpaid leave under FMLA, the 
employee will be required to submit sufficient documentation to support the 
leave. If an employee takes leave in response to a serious health condition, the 
employee will be required to submit written medical certification from the 
appropriate health care provider. The medical certification must include: 

A.  The start date of the medical condition; 

B.  The probable duration of the medical condition; 

C.  The appropriate medical facts, including a general statement as to the 

incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health 
care provider; 

D.  If the leave is to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious 

health condition, a statement that the family member requires psychological 

33 

 
 
 
 
and/or physical care, and needs assistance for basic medical, hygienic, 
nutritional, safety, or transportation needs in response to such a condition; 

E.  If the leave is in response to the employee’s serious health condition, a 

statement that the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential 
functions of the employee’s position or requires medical treatment for a 
serious condition; and 

F.  In the event of intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule for planned 
medical treatments, the dates of the treatments (actual or estimates), the 
duration of the treatments, and the period of recovery if applicable; or a 
statement that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition 
with an unknown duration, whether the patient is currently incapacitated, and 
the estimated duration and frequency of the episodes of incapacity. 

5-8.  Continued Employment and Health Benefits 

A.  An employee who takes leave under FMLA is entitled, upon return to duty, to 

be returned to the same position the employee held before taking FMLA leave 
or an equivalent position with the same benefits, pay, status, and other terms 
and conditions of employment. FEMA may not return an employee to an 
equivalent position that is subject to a written notification of a reduction-in-
force, if the employee’s previous position is not affected by a reduction-in-
force. 

B.  An employee enrolled in a health plan through the Federal Employees Health 
Benefits Program (FEHB) who invokes his or her right to take unpaid leave 
under FMLA, may continue his or her health benefits if the employee pays his 
or her appropriate employee share of the insurance premiums. 

C.  The supervisor of record may require an employee to report periodically on 

his or her status and intention to return to work. 

5-9.  Return to Work 

If an employee takes leave under FMLA to respond to a serious health condition, 
the employee may be required to provide a written medical certification from the 
employee’s health care provider that the employee is able to perform the 
essential functions of his or her position before the employee will be allowed to 
return to work. The employee’s supervisor must gain OCCHCO’s approval to 
request such certification before giving notice to the employee of the 
requirement. The employee’s supervisor will inform the employee of the need to 
provide such documentation before the employee takes leave. If the need for the 
leave is unforeseeable, the employee will be given notice of the certification 
requirement as soon as practicable under the circumstances. If an employee is 
required to provide written certification before returning to work, FEMA must 
apply the requirement to all similarly situated employees (i.e., employees in the 
same occupation or with the same serious health condition). 

34 

 
 
 
5-10.  Records and Reporting 

OCCHCO will maintain and provide records on the use of FMLA as appropriate. 
At a minimum, the records will state the employee’s basic rate of pay, 
occupational series, the number of hours taken, and the reason for the FMLA 
leave. 

35 

 
 
 
ABSENCE FOR MATERNITY AND PATERNITY 

6-1.  Eligibility and Use of Leave for Maternity and Paternity Reasons 

A.  Absence due to pregnancy is treated like any other period of medical 

incapacitation. 

B.  Employees are eligible to use a combination of annual leave, sick leave, 
compensatory time off or credit time if available, LWOP, FMLA, and/or 
donated leave for maternity or paternity related absences. Parents may use 
annual leave, compensatory time off if available, FMLA, and LWOP to 
prepare for the birth of a child (e.g., to attend birthing classes), to bond with or 
care for a healthy newborn child, or to care for other children in the 
household. 

C.  Parents may not use sick leave or donated leave to be absent from work to 

bond with or care for a healthy newborn child. 

D.  The Federal Government, including FEMA, does not offer a separate leave 
benefit for maternity or paternity purposes (i.e., maternity leave or paternity 
leave). 

E.  State regulations and policies covering maternity or paternity leave do not 
supersede the policies, rules, and regulations of the Federal Government. 

6-2.  Leave Requests 

A.  Employees requesting leave for maternity or paternity reasons shall submit a 
written request to their supervisor. For planning purposes, the written request 
should specify the precise nature of leave being requested; i.e., sick leave, 
annual leave, FMLA, and/or LWOP. 

B.  Employees should submit a physician's or practitioner's written certification 
stating that the employee or mother is pregnant, the expected delivery date, 
the approximate time period for which the employee or mother will be 
incapacitated because of pregnancy, and the date on which the employee 
can be expected, under normal conditions, to return to work. 

C.  When submitting the request, the employee should indicate whether or not 

the employee intends to return to duty after delivery. If the employee does not 
intend to return to duty after the delivery, the employee’s resignation should 
be obtained in advance to be effective at the expiration of the period of paid 
leave. 

D.  The employee should report pregnancy in a reasonable time after it is known 
so that steps can be taken to protect the mother’s health, adjust her working 
conditions if necessary, and to plan for any staffing adjustments. When there 
is doubt concerning the employee's ability to continue to perform the duties of 
the position safely, the supervisor should have her furnish a medical 
certificate authorizing continued work and should take whatever precautionary 

36 

 
 
measures appear necessary. OCCHCO can provide guidance on available 
leave options. 

6-3.  Leave for Maternity Reasons 

A.  A birth mother is entitled to use sick leave for medical appointments, 

hospitalization, and for her period of incapacitation following childbirth. 

B.  A mother may use accrued annual leave for pregnancy, childbirth, and to 

bond with or care for a healthy newborn child. 

C.  A mother is entitled to use up to 12 weeks (480 hours) unpaid leave under 

FMLA for absences related to pregnancy and childbirth, to provide care to a 
newborn child with a serious health condition, or to bond with a newborn 
child. 

D.  An employee may not use sick leave or donated leave to extend an absence 

related to pregnancy or childbirth beyond the period of physical 
incapacitation.  

6-4.  Leave for Paternity Reasons 

A.  A birth father may use up to 12 weeks (480 hours) of accrued sick leave each 
year to accompany the mother to prenatal appointments, during periods when 
the mother or newborn child is hospitalized, and/or during the mother’s 
recovery periods (see section 4-1). 

B.  A father may use accrued annual leave to care for the mother of a newborn 
child during pregnancy and childbirth, or to bond with or care for a healthy 
newborn child. 

C.  A father is entitled to use up to 12 weeks (480 hours) of unpaid leave under 

FMLA to care for the mother of a newborn child during her period of 
incapacitation, to provide care if the mother or child has a serious health 
condition, or to bond with a newborn child. 

D.  With supervisory approval, a father may use LWOP for absences related to 

pregnancy and childbirth, or to bond with or care for a healthy newborn child. 

6-5.  Advance of Annual and/or Sick Leave 

A.  FEMA may advance the amount of annual leave a mother or father would 
accrue during the remainder of the leave year for purposes related to 
childbirth. 

B.  FEMA must advance a maximum of 30 days (240 hours) of sick leave to a 

mother or father during the mother’s period of incapacitation from pregnancy, 
childbirth, or to care for a child with a serious health condition. 

37 

 
 
 
 
C.  An employee is required to repay advanced annual or sick leave, except in 

very limited circumstances (e.g., disability retirement or death). An employee 
who requests advanced annual or sick leave will be indebted to FEMA until 
the debt is repaid (usually through earning annual or sick leave). FEMA will 
not advance annual or sick leave to an employee who will not or is not 
expected to return to duty after taking leave. 

D.  See sections 3-3 and 4-6 for specific rules on advancing annual or sick leave. 

6-6.  FMLA for Maternity and Paternity Purposes 

A.  An employee may begin to use FMLA protected leave before the actual date 
of the birth which will also begin the 12 month period to use leave under 
FMLA. If an employee does invoke the right to leave under FMLA prior to the 
date of birth, the employee’s 12 month period to use leave under FMLA 
begins on the date the employee first takes leave under FMLA and may end 
before the child’s first birthday. 

B.  If an employee wishes to use FMLA to bond with a newborn child, the 

employee must invoke the use of FMLA before the child’s first birthday. 

C.  With supervisor approval, an employee may use leave under FMLA on an 

intermittent basis for care or bonding with a newborn child. 

D.  Employees must adhere to all procedures for the use of leave under FMLA. 

For additional information on the use of FMLA, see Chapter 5. 

6-7.  VLTP for Maternity and Paternity Purposes 

A.  Pregnancy is treated as a short-term illness for the purpose of the Voluntary 

Leave Transfer Program (VLTP). 

B.  Employees may not use donated leave to care for or bond with a healthy 

newborn child, or to care for healthy children in the home. 

C.  Employees may apply to become a leave recipient under the VLTP for 

maternity or paternity related absences including periods when a mother is 
under doctor ordered bed rest, periods when the mother is incapacitated 
following childbirth, absences related to medical complications arising from 
pregnancy or childbirth, or absences to care for a newborn child with a 
serious health condition. 

D.  Donated leave may be substituted retroactively for any period of leave without 

pay used because of a medical emergency or used to liquidate a debt 
incurred by an employee for receiving advanced annual or sick leave. 

6-8.  Adoption and Foster Care 

Employees may use the following leave flexibilities to adopt or foster a child: 

38 

 
 
 
 
A.  Sick leave 

1.  An employee may use sick leave for: 

i.  Appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, or attorneys; 

ii.  Court proceedings; 

iii.  Required travel; 

iv.  Any periods when the employee is required by the adoption agency or 

a court to take time off from work to care for an adopted child; or 

v.  Any other activities necessary to complete an adoption; 

2.  An employee may not use sick leave to bond with or care for a healthy 

child. 

3.  An employee, who is fostering a child, can only use sick leave for 
adoption-related purposes if the employee is adopting the child. 

4.  An employee who is accompanying a family member to activities related 

to an adoption is not entitled to use sick leave for adoption. 

5.  FEMA may request administratively acceptable evidence for the use of 

sick leave for adoption-related purposes. 

6.  Upon request, employees must be granted up to 240 hours of advanced 
sick leave for purposes related to adopting or fostering a child with a 
serious health condition, or up to 104 hours of advanced sick leave to care 
for a child with a routine illness, or for medical, dental, or optical 
appointments. 

B.  Annual and Paid leave 

1.  Annual leave may be used for any purpose relating to adopting or 

fostering a child. 

2.  FEMA may advance an employee the amount of annual leave an 
employee would accrue during the remainder of the leave year. 

C.  An employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for adoption or foster care expires 

12 months after the placement of the child with the employee. 

D.  Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (VLTP) 

1.  Employees may apply to receive donated leave only in response to 
medical emergencies (e.g., care of an adopted or foster child with a 
serious health condition). 

2.  Donated leave may be substituted retroactively for any period of leave 

without pay used because of a medical emergency. 

39 

 
 
 
7-1.  Eligibility and Use of Court Leave 

COURT LEAVE 

A.  Court leave is not charged to leave and will not result in a loss of pay to 

employees who serve as a juror. 

B.  If the employee is a party to a suit with only private parties, the employee 

cannot use court leave, but must use annual leave, credit or compensatory 
leave, or LWOP. 

C.  Court leave must be requested in advance, and a copy of the summons or 
subpoena must be included in the request. Employees may be required to 
provide proof of attendance as a juror or witness. 

D.  There is no limit on the amount of court leave that may be granted to an 

employee. 

E.  Unless the time or distance involved make it impractical, employees are 

expected to leave their duty station no earlier than necessary to arrive on time 
for court service, and to return to work at the end of each day’s court service if 
the employee can return to work at least one hour before the end of the 
employee’s normal tour of duty.  

F.  An employee released from jury or witness duty who is required to return to 
duty during the workday may request annual leave, credit or compensatory 
time off if available, or LWOP in lieu of returning to duty for the remainder of 
the workday. 

G.  An employee will be charged with AWOL if: 

1.  The employee is dismissed from jury or witness duty and is directed to 

return to duty but does not; or 

2.  The employee’s service as a juror or witness is cancelled for the day but 

the employee does not report to work as scheduled.  

H.  For court leave purposes, applicable judicial proceedings includes any trial, 

action, suit, or other matter before a court, but does not include an 
administrative proceeding such as an arbitration hearing or a hearing or 
appeal before the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor 
Relations Authority, or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 

7-2.  Jury Duty 

FEMA’s policy is to not seek to have employees excused from jury duty, except 
for key officials whose services cannot be spared for an extended period of time. 

A.  If an employee is on a period of scheduled annual leave when called to serve 

as a juror, court leave must be substituted and used if the employee is 
otherwise eligible. Jury duty is considered an “exigency of public business,” 
and annual leave which has been forfeited because of a period of court leave 
may be restored if it otherwise meets the criteria for restoration (e.g., had 

40 

 
 
been scheduled and approved in writing at least three pay periods before the 
end of the leave year). 

B.  When a holiday occurs during the period an employee is called to jury duty or 
and the employee is normally required to work on the holiday, the employee 
receives holiday (leave) pay. The employee does not receive holiday 
premium pay. 

C.  Employees in a non-pay status (LWOP, AWOL, suspension, or furlough) 

when called for jury duty are not entitled to court leave. An employee must be 
scheduled for paid leave or normal duty in order to qualify for court leave. 

7-3.  Serving as a Witness 

A.  When an employee is called to appear as a witness, the employee’s leave 
status depends on whether the employee is testifying in an official or non-
official status, which party is requesting the employee’s testimony, and 
whether the United States, a State, or local government is a party to the 
action. 

B.  An employee called to testify in an official capacity (i.e., the testimony is 

related to current or former official duties), or assigned by FEMA to produce 
official records is in official duty status and does not use court leave, 
regardless of who the parties are to a case. 

1.  An employee required to testify in an official capacity on a regular day off 

must be compensated accordingly. 

2.  While testifying in an official duty status, an employee is eligible for 
government travel expenses, including per diem, as appropriate. 

C.  An employee called as a witness in a non-official capacity on behalf of a state 
or local government, or on behalf of any party in connection with any judicial 
proceeding in which the United States, the District of Columbia, a state, or 
local government is a party must be given court leave. 

D.  If an employee is called to give a deposition in a case which a party in the 
proceeding is the United States, the District of Columbia, a state, or local 
government, the employee is entitled to court leave for the time involved in 
giving the deposition.  

E.  An employee appearing in court for a traffic violation is not entitled to court 
leave in connection with his or her appearance in court as a defendant. 

F.  An employee testifying on his or her behalf cannot use court leave and must 
use annual leave, LWOP, or credit or compensatory time off if available. 

G.  If an employee is a party in a suit against the United States, the District of 
Columbia, a state, or local government, the time the employee spends in 
preparation for and during trial cannot be charged to court leave, but must be 
charged to annual leave, LWOP, or credit or compensatory time off if 
available. 

41 

 
 
1.  Except if an employee is a plaintiff against a Federal agency in a civil 

action related to, or caused by, a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
and the employee-plaintiff prevails in the civil action. Under such 
circumstances the employee should not be charged with leave and is 
entitled to official time for court appearances.  

2.  If the employee-plaintiff does not prevail in such a civil rights action, any 
related absences must be charged to annual leave, LWOP, or credit or 
compensatory time off if available. 

3.  Until the conclusion of the civil rights action, the leave status for an 

employee-plaintiff must tentatively be recorded as annual leave, accrued 
credit or compensatory leave, or LWOP. 

H.  An employee called as a witness in a nonofficial capacity in a judicial 

proceeding involving only private parties is not entitled to court leave and 
must use annual leave, credit or compensatory leave, or LWOP for such 
appearances. 

I.  An employee who is not summoned as a witness, but who appears before a 

court voluntarily and requests to testify is not entitled to court leave. 

J.  If an employee is on a period of scheduled annual leave when called to serve 
as a witness, court leave must be substituted and used if the employee is 
otherwise eligible. Serving as a witness service is considered an “exigency of 
public business,” and annual leave which has been forfeited because of a 
period of court leave may be restored if it otherwise meets the criteria for 
restoration (e.g., had been scheduled and approved in writing at least three 
pay periods before the end of the leave year). 

K.  Employees do not receive court leave to serve as a witness on a regular day 

off (i.e., if the employee is on a compressed work schedule).  

L.  When a holiday occurs during the period an employee is called to serve as a 
witness and the employee is normally required to work on the holiday, the 
employee receives holiday (leave) pay. The employee does not receive 
holiday premium pay. 

M.  Employees in a non-pay status (LWOP, AWOL, suspension, or furlough) 

when called to serve as a witness are not entitled to court leave. An employee 
must be scheduled for paid leave or normal duty in order to qualify for court 
leave. 

7-4.  Court or Witness Fees 

A.  If a jurisdiction provides compensation or fees to jurors or witnesses to help 
make up for lost wages as a result of serving as a juror or witness and the 
employee uses court leave or is in an official duty status, the employee must 
collect any such compensation for their service and turn it in to FEMA. An 
employee who neglects to collect the fees for jury service will be indebted to 
FEMA. 

42 

 
 
B.  If a jurisdiction reimburses jurors or witnesses for costs associated with 
serving as a juror or witness (i.e., meals, parking, or transportation), the 
employee is entitled to retain any such reimbursements. 

C.  An employee appearing as a witness in a nonofficial capacity in a judicial 
proceeding involving only private parties is entitled to retain any fees or 
expenses associated with such appearances. 

D.  If an employee is in a non-pay status (i.e., LWOP, AWOL, suspension, or 

furlough) while serving as a juror or witness, the employee is entitled to retain 
all forms of compensation associated with service as a juror or witness. 

7-5.  Court Leave and Other Leave Categories 

A.  If an employee is on a period of scheduled annual leave when called to serve 

as a juror or witness, court leave must be substituted and used if the 
employee is otherwise eligible. Jury duty or witness service is considered an 
“exigency of public business,” and annual leave which has been forfeited 
because of a period of court leave may be restored if it otherwise meets the 
criteria for restoration (e.g., had been scheduled and approved in writing at 
least three pay periods before the end of the leave year). 

B.  Employees do not receive court leave to serve as a juror or witness on a 
regular day off (i.e., if the employee is on a compressed work schedule).  

C.  When a holiday occurs during the period an employee is called to jury duty or 
to serve as a witness and the employee is normally required to work on the 
holiday, the employee receives holiday (leave) pay. The employee does not 
receive holiday premium pay. 

D.  Employees in a non-pay status (LWOP, AWOL, suspension, or furlough) 
when called for jury duty or to serve as a witness are not entitled to court 
leave. An employee must be scheduled for paid leave or normal duty in order 
to qualify for court leave. 

43 

 
 
 
 
8-1.  Eligibility 

MILITARY LEAVE 

A.  Full-time permanent employees or non-permanent employees with 
appointments of one year or more are eligible for military leave. 

B.  Employees dishonorably discharged from the military are not eligible for 

military leave. 

C.  Part-time employees with a scheduled tour of duty between 16 and 32 hours 

per week are eligible for prorated military leave. 

D.  Employees with temporary appointments of less than one year are not eligible 
for military leave. However, supervisors must approve requests from any 
employee servicing in one of the uniformed services to use annual leave, 
compensatory time off, LWOP, Absent-US to complete an obligation to the 
military. 

8-2.  Use of Military Leave 

A.  An employee is entitled to time off without a loss of pay for certain types of 
active or inactive duty in the National Guard or as a Reserve of the Armed 
Forces (see 5 U.S.C. § 6323). 

B.  Employees should give advanced written or verbal notice to their supervisors 
according to their office procedures when called for military duty. If a military 
necessity prevents giving advance notice or giving advance notice is 
otherwise impossible or unreasonable, advance notice of military duty is not 
required. However, to use military leave (regular or emergency), the 
employee must provide the supervisor with a copy of the military orders, 
annual drill schedule, or other documentation identifying the dates of the 
military obligation. 

1.  Employees must provide advance notice, but the failure to do so should 
not result in a denial of the leave request for military duty. However, 
management can require employees to follow certain guidelines in 
providing advance notice for future deployments. 

2.  Managers can deny reemployment rights when an employee has failed to 

provide advance notice of a foreseeable military obligation or when 
feasible. 

3.  According to the Department of Labor and the Department of Defense, 

advance notice means as early as possible or feasible, with a 
recommendation that notice should be given at least 30 days in advance. 

C.  Military leave is charged in 1 hour increments. Military leave may only be 

charged for hours that the employee would otherwise have worked for FEMA 
in a pay status. 

44 

 
 
D.  Military leave cannot be charged for regular days off or holidays. When a 
holiday occurs during a period of military leave, the employee will not be 
charged for military leave, but will receive holiday leave for the holiday. 

E.  Employees may not be advanced annual or sick leave during a period of 

active military duty. 

F.  Employees serving on active military duty cannot perform work for FEMA or 

receive compensation for such work during the period of active duty. 

8-3.  Accumulation and Charging of Military Leave 

A.  Full-time employees receive 120 hours of military leave per fiscal year. 

Military leave is not accrued during the year, eligible employees are credited 
with the full 120 hours of military leave on the first day of employment and 
then at the start of each fiscal year on October 1.  

B.  Employees may carry over a maximum of 120 hours of military leave into the 
next fiscal year. Eligible employees may use up to 240 hours of military leave 
in any given fiscal year. If an employee’s military orders require service that 
extends across fiscal years, an employee has the potential to use up to 360 
hours of military leave in a calendar year. 

C.  Employees are not required to return from military duty to a civilian position 

before using military leave earned during a new fiscal year. 

1.  Any new military leave must be associated with military duties. 

2.  For service of 30 days or less, the employee must report to work no later 
than the first regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day 
after completion of service or as soon as possible after an 8 hour period if 
reporting (see 38 U.S.C. § 4312(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) and (B); 5 C.F.R. § 
353.205(a)). 

3.  For service of 31 to 180 days, employees must submit an application for 
reemployment no later than 14 days after completion of the service, or if 
impossible, the next full calendar day when submission is possible (see 38 
U.S.C. § 4312(e)(1)(C); 5 C.F.R. § 353.205(b)). 

4.  For service of 181 days or more, the employee must submit an application 
no later than 90 days after the completion of the service (see 38 U.S.C. § 
4312(e)(1)(D); 5 C.F.R. §353.205(c) 

D.  The amounts of military leave accrued by part-time employees are pro-rated 

according to their scheduled tour of duty. 

E.  Absences for military duty in excess of an employee’s available military leave 
may be charged to annual leave, compensatory time off, or LWOP at the 
request of the employee. In such circumstances, if an employee does not 
specify a paid leave category, the employee will be placed in a LWOP status. 

45 

 
 
1.  Supervisors must grant an employee’s request to use accrued annual 
leave, compensatory time, or LWOP for absences for military duty in 
excess of available military leave. 

2.  Supervisors must grant an employee’s request to use sick leave for 

absences for military duty in excess of available military leave, but only to 
the extent that the sick leave request compiles with statutes, regulations, 
and FEMA policy on the use of sick leave. 

3.  Supervisors cannot require employees to use accrued leave to cover his 
or her absence in excess of the employee’s available military leave. 

8-4.  Military Leave (Regular) 

A.  Regular military leave allows employees to participate in active duty, active 
duty training, and inactive duty training. Inactive duty training is authorized 
training performed by members of a Reserve component not on active duty 
and performed in connection with the prescribed activities of the Reserve 
component. 

B.  Employees using annual leave or compensatory time off during applicable 

periods of military duty may be entitled to their full civilian pay, as well as their 
military pay if they meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. § 6323. Generally, if an 
employee chooses to use his or her military leave, then the employee’s 
civilian pay will be reduced by the amount of military pay the employee 
receives for military leave. 

8-5.  Military Leave (Emergency) 

A.  Eligible employees may receive up to 22 workdays of military leave per 

calendar year for emergency duty ordered by the President, the Secretary of 
Defense, or a State Governor. Supervisors must grant leave for absences 
due to military obligations. 

B.  The 22 workdays of emergency military leave is in addition to the 15 

workdays of regular military leave. 

C.  Emergency leave is provided to employees who perform military duties in 
support of civil authorities in the protection of life and property, or who 
perform full-time military service in response to a contingency operation (see 
5 U.S.C. § 6323(b) and 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(13)). Contingency operations are 
military operations that: 

1.  Are designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which 
members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military 
actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or 
against an opposing military force; or 

2.  Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of 
the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. § 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 

46 

 
 
 
12305, 12406; 10 U.S.C. Chapter 15; or any other provision of law during 
a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or 
Congress. 

D.  Employees will have their civilian pay reduced by any military pay received 
during periods of emergency military leave. However, an employee may 
choose not to take military leave and instead use annual leave, compensatory 
time off, or sick leave in order to retain both civilian and military pay. 

47 

 
 
 
9-1.  Earning Home Leave 

HOME LEAVE 

A.  Home leave is earned in the very limited situation where an employee is on a 
foreign duty assignment for the specific purpose of visiting the United States, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the territories or possessions of the 
United States. 

B.  Home leave is earned in addition to annual and sick leave. 

C.  Employees begin earning home leave on the date of the employee’s arrival at 
a duty post outside of the United States, or on the date of entrance on duty 
when recruited abroad.  

D.  Employees stop earning home leave on the employee’s date of departure 

from the duty post outside of the United States for separation or reassignment 
in the United States, or the date of separation if the employee separates 
when abroad, whichever occurs first.  

E.  Employees will earn home leave while on a foreign duty assignment including 

periods of: 

1.  Absence in a non-pay status up to 2 workweeks (80 hours) within each 12 

month service period abroad; 

2.  Authorized leave with pay; 

3.  Time spent in the United States Armed Forces which interrupts service 

abroad (but only for eligibility, not leave-earning purposes, see section 9-
1.G.6.); and 

4.  A period of detail. 

F.  Home leave is earned in daily units and will be credited to an employee’s 

leave account in multiples of one day increments (based on an 8 hour day). 

G.  For each 12 months of service abroad, an employee earns home leave at the 

following rate: 

1.  15 days for appointments or positions FEMA requires the incumbent to 

accept assignments anywhere in the world as the needs of FEMA dictate;  

2.  15 days for employees serving with a United States mission to a public 

international organization; 

3.  15 days for serving at foreign posts which FEMA pays a foreign or non-

foreign (but not a tropical) differential of 20 percent or more; 

4.  10 days for posts not covered by 1, 2, or 3, and which FEMA pays a 

foreign or territorial (but not a tropical) differential of at least 10 percent but 
less than 20 percent; 

5.  5 days for posts not included in 1, 2, 3, or 4. 

48 

 
6.  0 days for employees who would earn home leave according to 1, 2, 3, 4, 

or 5, but whose service is interrupted by a tour of duty in the Armed 
Forces for the duration of the tour abroad. 

H.  Home leave may accumulate to a maximum of 45 days. 

I.  For an employee whose foreign duty assignment is interrupted by a tour of 
duty in the Armed Forces of the United States will not accrue home leave 
during the period of active military service. 

J.  When an employee returns to a position in the United States, any unused 
home leave is held in abeyance. If the employee receives another foreign 
duty assignment, the unused home leave will be recredited.  

K.  All unused home leave is forfeited when an employee has a break in Federal 

service of more than 90 calendar days. 

9-2.  Use of Home Leave 

A.  An employee must complete a basis service period of 24 months of 

continuous creditable service outside of the United States before using home 
leave. To use home leave, an employee must be expected to return to the 
foreign duty assignment after a period of home leave. An employee cannot 
terminate a foreign duty assignment while on home leave. 

B.  Home leave may not be the basis for terminal leave or a lump sum payment 

upon separation from FEMA or the Federal Service. 

C.  Home leave is approved at the discretion of the official responsible for 

authorizing leave for the employee. 

D.  The minimum charge for home leave is 1 day and home leave is charged in 1 

day increments. 

E.  Home leave can only be used to visit United States, the Commonwealth of 

Puerto Rico, or the territories or possessions of the United States. 

F.  Home leave may not be charged for holidays, regular non-workdays, and 

non-workdays authorized by administrative order. 

G.  Home leave may be used in conjunction with annual leave, compensatory 

time off, or leave without pay. 

H.  An employee cannot substitute annual leave for periods previously charged to 
home leave to avoid forfeiture of annual leave at the end of the leave year. 

I.  The granting of home leave does not entitle the employee to payment or 

reimbursement of travel or transportation expenses. 

49 

 
 
 
9-3.  Refund of Home Leave 

A.  An employee who does not return to service abroad after a period of home 
leave, or after the completion of an assignment in the United States is 
indebted for the used home leave. 

B.  An employee can satisfy a debt due to used home leave by: 

1.  A charge against the employee’s annual leave; 

2.  A charge against any final salary payments; 

3.  A charge against any other financial assets administered by the Federal 

government; or 

4.  Reimbursing FEMA for the monetary value of the used home leave. 

C.  A refund for this indebtedness is not required if: 

1.  The employee completes more than six months of service in an 

assignment in the United States following the period of home leave; 

2.  When FEMA determines that the employee’s failure to return was due to 
compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature, 
such as issues involving physical or mental health, or circumstances over 
which the employee has no control; or 

3.  FEMA determines that it is in the public interest to not return the employee 

to an overseas assignment. 

50 

 
 
 
10-1.  Purpose of Excused Absences 

EXCUSED ABSENCE 

Employees may be excused from performing their regular duties for certain 
activities which are considered to be in the interest of the Government. Absences 
may also be granted in certain other special circumstances, such as hazardous 
weather conditions. The administrative leave categories described in this Chapter 
are the only allowable administrative leave categories. Employees shall record 
their time during such absences as either the appropriate administrative leave 
category or official time according to the policies established by this Chapter. 

10-2.  Time-Off Awards 

A Time-Off Award (TOA) is an excused absence granted to an employee to be 
used without charge to leave or loss of pay in recognition of individual or group 
contributions or accomplishments. (See FEMA Manual 255-4-1, Employee 
Awards and Recognition, for more information on the process and limits for 
granting Time-Off Awards). 

A.  TOAs must be granted and used in one hour increments. 

B.  TOAs must be scheduled and used within 26 pay periods from the date the 
TOA was awarded. After the 26th pay period, any unused time off will be 
automatically forfeited and may not be restored or otherwise substituted. 

C.  TOAs have no effect on annual leave carryover limitations. 

D.  TOAs cannot be converted into cash payments under any circumstances (5 

C.F.R. 451.104(f)). 

E.  If an employee separates from FEMA or the Federal service before using all 

time-off hours, any unused time off will be forfeited. 

F.  If an employee transfers to or from another DHS Component, any available 

TOAs will be honored at the employee’s new position. FEMA will not transfer 
TOAs to or from other Federal agencies. 

G.  TOA’s shall not be granted to create the effect of a holiday or treated as 

administrative excusals or leave (i.e., granting the entire organization or office 
a TOA to be used on a specific day). 

10-3.  Voting 

FEMA’s policy is to encourage employees to exercise their voting rights and 
permits a limited amount of excused absence for voting.  

A.  Employees are not allowed administrative leave for voting by absentee ballot. 
Most states allow absentee voting for both primary and general elections. 
Employees are responsible for knowing the election laws for their state. 

51 

 
 
 
B.  Employees must request administrative leave for voting or registering to vote 

in advance. 

C.  As a general rule, where the polls are not open at least 3 hours either before 
or after an employee's regular hours of work he or she may be granted an 
amount of administrative leave which will permit him or her to report for work 
3 hours after the polls open or leave work 3 hours before the polls close, 
whichever requires the lesser amount of time off. 

D.  Under exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary to enable the 

employee to vote, a greater amount of administrative leave may be granted, 
but not to exceed a full day. These exceptions must be noted under "Other 
Leave" on FEMA WebTA and approved by the supervisor in advance. 

E.  If an employee’s voting place is beyond a normal commuting distance and 

voting by absentee ballot is either not permitted or not possible, the employee 
may be granted a maximum of one workday to make the trip to the voting 
place to vote at the discretion of the supervisor. If more than one workday is 
needed the employee may request annual leave, compensatory time off, or 
LWOP for the additional period of absence. Under such circumstances 
employees must request administrative leave at least seven calendar days in 
advance and provide administratively acceptable documentation that 
demonstrates the employee is not permitted to vote absentee. 

F.  Where employees vote in jurisdictions that require registration in person, 

administrative leave may be granted under the same conditions as 
administrative leave for voting. Administrative leave may not be granted if 
registration can be accomplished on a non-work day and the place of 
registration is within a reasonable one day round trip travel distance of the 
employee’s place of residence.  

G.  Employees who take time off to participate in other electoral activities, such 
as serving as election officers, precinct inspectors or clerks, or poll workers 
may not be granted administrative leave for these activities. Any time spent 
during regular duty hours for these activities must be charged to annual leave, 
compensatory time, credit hours, or LWOP if granted. 

10-4.  Absences to Take Examinations 

Employees taking noncompetitive civil service examinations for positions in 
FEMA, examinations established by operating units to determine qualifications 
for promotion, or competitive examinations to qualify for competitive status in the 
positions which they hold in FEMA may be granted administrative leave for the 
time necessary to take the examination, including the time it takes the employee 
to travel to and from the examination site, if that site is not the employee’s normal 
duty station. 

Supervisors may grant administrative leave for the time necessary to take other 
examinations (e.g., a CPA exam, bar exam) which are directly related to the 
employee’s current or prospective duties within FEMA.  

52 

 
 
10-5.  Absences for Job Required Medical Examinations 

An employee may be granted administrative leave to take a medical examination 
officially required in connection with the employee’s continued employment with 
FEMA. 

10-6.  Immediate Treatment of On-the-Job Injuries 

An employee injured on-the-job may be granted administrative leave for an initial 
examination and for immediate treatment by a physician of the employee’s 
choice on the day of the injury. Where local treatment is not available, or for 
employees who are duty stationed outside the continental United States, an 
employee may be excused for a reasonable period for travel to and from the 
nearest medical facility for necessary treatment. 

10-7.  Changes in Tour of Duty During Disasters 

During disasters, some employees may be required to immediately change their 
tour of duty hours. The FEMA Administrator may authorize up to one day of 
administrative leave for employees who are required to change their normal duty 
hours to prepare for or execute emergency response or recovery assignments. 

For example, an employee with a normal tour of duty of Monday through Friday, 
8:30 am to 5:30 pm, is given an emergency assignment on Tuesday from 7:00 
pm to 7:00 am through the rest of the week. On Thursday at noon, the 
emergency is cancelled and the employee is told not to report to the emergency 
assignment, but to report back to his or her normal workplace at 8:30 am on 
Friday. The employee may be granted administrative leave for the Thursday, so 
the employee does not suffer a loss of leave or pay due to the emergency 
assignment. 

10-8.  Emergency or Hazardous Weather Conditions 

Administrative Leave may be granted, subject to the restrictions found in FEMA’s 
Telework and CORE Manuals, due to hazardous weather conditions or other 
emergencies. 

A.  When weather or emergency conditions result in OPM announcing a delayed 
arrival, non-emergency employees will be excused without charge to leave or 
loss of pay for the period from normal arrival time at work until the revised 
expected arrival time at work. Employees who arrive later than their expected 
arrival time will be charged annual leave or LWOP for the additional period of 
absence from work. Tardiness beyond the expected arrival time may be 
excused at the discretion of the leave-approving official if the employee made 
a reasonably diligent effort to arrive at work on time. Employees on previously 
approved scheduled leave for the entire day remain in the same leave status 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
and are not granted excused absence for the period from their normal 
departure time to the revised arrival time. 

B.  When weather or emergency conditions result in OPM announcing an early 
dismissal in which employees will be dismissed a set period of time earlier 
than their normal departure times. Employees who are in a duty status at the 
time an early dismissal is announced will be excused without charge to leave 
or loss of pay for the remainder of the work day, even if they were scheduled 
to take leave later in the day. 

1.  Employees who are in a duty status at the time an early dismissal is 

announced but leave before their authorized dismissal with supervisor 
approval (but not due to a hardship) shall be charged annual leave or 
LWOP for the remainder of the scheduled workday. 

2.  Employees who fail to report to work before the authorized early dismissal 

shall be charged annual leave or AWOL for the entire workday. 

3.  Employees on previously approved leave shall continue to be charged for 

leave for the entire workday. 

4.  Employees scheduled to return from leave after an early dismissal is 
announced but before their authorized dismissal, shall continue to be 
charged with leave until their dismissal time. Absence after the dismissal 
time shall be charged as excused absence even if the employee is 
scheduled to take leave later in the day. 

5.  Employees scheduled to report to work after an early dismissal is 

announced may be granted excused absence for the remainder of the 
workday even if they were scheduled to take leave later in the day. 

C.  When a weather or emergency conditions results in the closing of all or part of 
FEMA’s activities, employees who work in the offices affected by the closing 
may be granted administrative leave, subject to the policies detailed in this 
Section, FEMA’s Telework Manual (see Telework Manual, 123-9-1) and 
CORE Manual (see CORE Manual, 252-11-1).  

1.  Employees on pre-approved paid leave on a day when a FEMA office is 
closed will not have their leave cancelled and granted administrative 
leave. In such cases, employees will remain in their pre-approved leave 
category. Employees on LWOP pending disability, in receipt of workers’ 
compensation, military leave, on suspension, or in a non-pay status on the 
workday immediately before and the first workday after the closure will 
also not be granted administrative leave. 

2.  If a FEMA facility is closed due to inclement weather or other 

emergencies, COREs who would normally work at that location will be 
directed to work at an alternate work location or their telework site if they 
have a current telework agreement. In such circumstances, COREs will 
only be granted administrative leave if an emergency affects their 
alternate or telework location (i.e., loss of power, loss of heat, loss of 
internet connectivity, etc.). 

54 

 
3.  Unscheduled telework is incorporated into FEMA’s emergency 

preparedness operations to maintain productivity and help ensure the 
safety of the Federal workforce and the public.  

a.  When a FEMA facility is open, but employees are given the option of 

unscheduled annual leave, LWOP, or telework, the following 
procedures apply: 

i.  Emergency Employees must report for duty as directed unless they 
are telework ready and permitted to telework by their supervisors. 

ii.  Non-Emergency Employees shall report to work or notify their 

supervisors in advance if they intend to take unscheduled leave. 

iii.  Non-Emergency Telework Ready Employees must report to work, 

commence telework, or request unscheduled leave. 

b.  When a FEMA facility is closed employees will be granted 

administrative leave for the number of hours they were scheduled to 
work unless they are covered by one of the following categories: 

i.  Emergency Employees must report for duty as directed unless they 
are telework ready and permitted to telework by their supervisors. 

ii.  Non-Emergency Telework Ready Employees who are already 
scheduled to telework or who are directed by FEMA to perform 
unscheduled telework must telework the entire work day. If directed 
to telework, such employees may request the use of annual leave, 
compensatory time off, credit hours, or sick leave, as appropriate; 
leave without pay; their flexible work schedule day off or revision of 
their work hours under flexible work schedules. 

iii.  COREs will be directed to work at an alternate work location or at 

their approved telework site if they have a current telework 
agreement. 

4.  Supervisors may excuse telework ready employees from work and grant 
annual or administrative leave, as appropriate, when an emergency 
adversely affects an employee’s telework site (e.g., disruption of 
electricity, loss of heat, loss of connectivity, etc.), or if the teleworker faces 
a personal hardship that prevents him or her from teleworking effectively. 
Dependent care needs do not ordinarily entitle a teleworker to 
administrative leave; annual leave will be granted as appropriate. 

10-9.  Veterans Attending Funeral Services 

An employee who is a veteran of a war, a veteran of a campaign or expedition for 
which a campaign badge has been authorized, or a member of an honor or 
ceremonial group of an organization of those veterans, may be granted 
administrative leave for the time necessary, not to exceed 4 hours in any one 
day, to participate as an active pallbearer, a member of a firing squad, or a guard 

55 

 
 
of honor in a funeral ceremony for a member of the Armed Forces whose 
remains are returned from abroad for final internment in the United States (5 
U.S.C. 6321). 

10-10. Funerals of Immediate Relatives in the Armed Forces 

A.  An employee is entitled to up to 3 days of administrative leave to make 
arrangements for, or attend the funeral or memorial service of a family 
member who died as a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while 
serving as a member of the Armed Forces in a combat zone (5 U.S.C. 6326). 

B.  The 3 days must be within the employee’s established tour of duty, including 
regularly scheduled overtime. The 3 days need not be taken on consecutive 
days, but the employee must provide a justification for use of funeral leave on 
nonconsecutive days. 

10-11. Attending Funerals of Fellow Federal Law Enforcement Officers 

A Federal law enforcement officer or a Federal firefighter may be excused from 
duty to attend the funeral of a fellow Federal law enforcement officer or Federal 
firefighter who was killed in the line of duty. When an employee is excused from 
duty, attendance at such a memorial service shall be considered to be an official 
duty of the officer or firefighter (5 U.S.C. 6328). 

10-12. Return from Active Military Service 

A.  Employees who are members of the National Guard or Reserves that are 
called to active duty in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations 
(OCO) (formerly the Global War on Terrorism) are entitled to 5 days of 
administrative leave upon their return from active duty. The entitlement 
applies to all employees, regardless of whether they are deployed overseas 
or stateside. The 5 days of excused absence are prorated for employees on 
uncommon tours of duty (see Executive Order 13223). 

B.  Employees must have been on active duty in support of OCO for at least 42 

consecutive days to be eligible for leave. 

C.  Employees may not be granted more than 5 days of administrative leave in a 
12 month period. The 12 month period begins on the first day of the excused 
absence and ends 365 days later. 

D.  The 5 days of leave must be used for a continuous period immediately upon 

an employee’s return to civilian duty. 

E.  The 5 days of leave must be granted as soon as an employee reports back 

for civilian duty or notifies FEMA of an intent to return to civilian duty. 

F.  The 5 days of leave may not be “banked” for use at a future time. 

56 

 
 
 
 
G.  Employees who separate prior to being granted the excused absence for this 
purpose do not have an entitlement to payment for any time not granted. 

10-13. Notice Period Preceding a Reduction in Force 

Employees who have received a general or specific notice of reduction in force 
may be granted administrative leave to attend interviews for other prospective 
positions within FEMA or another DHS component during the notice period. If 
administrative leave is granted, the amount of administrative leave is limited to 
the duration of the scheduled interview. Administrative leave may not be granted 
for any travel associated with attending an interview. 

10-14. Health and Fitness Programs 

To the extent FEMA has a current health and fitness program policy (FD 119-6, 
Employee Physical Fitness Program, February 1, 2012), supervisors may, at 
their discretion, grant limited leave for participation subject to the provisions of 
that policy. 

10-15. Blood Donations 

Employees who donate blood, including platelet donations, to the Red Cross, 
local hospitals, blood banks, or similar nonprofit organizations, may be granted 
administrative leave of up to 4 hours, once every three months. The 4 hours 
includes the time required to travel to and from the donation center, and to 
actually give the donation. If the employee is not accepted for blood donation, 
only the time necessary for the trip to and from the blood center is allowed as an 
excused absence. Time in excess of four hours may be granted at the 
employee’s request as annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off if 
available, or LWOP. 

10-16. Bone Marrow and Organ Donations 

A.  An employee is entitled to up to 30 days of leave per calendar year in addition 
to annual leave, sick leave, LWOP, or any other applicable leave categories 
available to an employee for organ donation and recovery. 

B.  An employee is entitled to up to 7 days of leave per calendar year in addition 
to annual leave, sick leave, LWOP, or any other applicable leave categories 
available to an employee for bone marrow donation and recovery. An 
employee may not be excused for bone marrow donation for their own future 
use. 

C.  With supervisory approval, employees may use annual leave, sick leave, 
advanced annual or sick leave, accrued compensatory or credit time off if 

57 

 
 
 
 
 
available, or LWOP for additional recovery time in excess of the 30 days for 
organ donation or 7 days for bone marrow donation. 

D.  Supervisors may approve, at their discretion, short periods of annual or sick 
leave for employees to participate in screening activities to become potential 
bone marrow or organ donors. 

E.  Leave for bone marrow or organ donation, but not screening activities, is a 
separate category of leave that is in addition to annual and sick leave. 

10-17. Absence to Perform Community Service 

Employee absence to perform community or other voluntary service should be 
charged to annual leave, compensatory time off if available, credit hours if 
available, or LWOP. However, in some rare circumstances it may be appropriate 
to grant employees administrative leave to participate in community service 
activities if: 

1.  It is directly related to FEMA’s mission; 

2.  It is officially sponsored or sanctioned by the FEMA Administrator (i.e., 

specific disaster relief activities.); 

3.  It will clearly enhance the professional development or skills of the employee 

in his/her current position;  

4.  The employee’s supervisor determines, in his or her discretion, that the 

employee’s absence will not adversely affect the operations of the office; and 

5.  The absence is brief and is determined to be in the interest of FEMA. 

10-18. Administrative Proceedings 

Employees called to testify or provide sworn statements at hearings conducted 
by the Office of Special Counsel, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, or arbitrators or grievance examiners 
appointed in federal agency employment disputes are in official duty status while 
testifying and no grant of excused absence will be recorded. Employees are in 
official duty status for the presentation of, but not the preparation for 
administrative grievances. 

10-19. Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints 

A.  A reasonable amount official time must be granted to employees who are 
pursuing their own EEO complaint against FEMA, or who have been 
approved to represent other FEMA employees who are pursuing an EEO 
complaint against FEMA to file a complaint, respond to agency or EEOC 
requests, and when the employee’s presence is authorized or required by the 
EEOC if otherwise on duty. Employees are considered in official duty status 
for such activities and no grant of excused absence will be recorded. 

58 

 
 
 
 
B.  The employee and his or her supervisor should discuss the amount of time is 
reasonable for preparation at least five business days prior to the employee 
using such time. The employee should notify their supervisor of the need for 
official time and the amount of time needed for upcoming meetings and 
hearings with agency officials or with EEOC Administrative Judges within 
three business days after the meeting or hearing is scheduled to allow the 
supervisor to schedule for the normal operations of the office. 

C.  Official time will not be granted to employees pursuing EEO complaints 
against other Federal agencies, or serving as representatives in such 
complaints. Absences related to such complaints must be charged to annual 
leave, compensatory time if available, or LWOP. 

59 

 
 
 
11-1.  Use of LWOP 

LEAVE WITHOUT PAY 

A.  Leave without pay (LWOP) is a temporary non-pay status and absence from 
duty that may be granted at the employee’s request. In most instances, 
granting LWOP is a matter of supervisory discretion and granting LWOP 
should be done sparingly, however, there are certain situations when 
employees are entitled to LWOP (see section 11-2). 

B.  LWOP must be requested and approved in advance before taking LWOP. 

Failure to do so will result in an unauthorized absence. 

C.  LWOP may not be charged for periods of unauthorized absence. Absence 

Without Leave (AWOL) is used for unauthorized absences. 

D.  Employees may be required to exhaust available annual leave before being 

granted LWOP if the absence is primarily for the personal convenience of the 
employee. 

E.  LWOP is charged in 15 minute increments. 

F.  LWOP is not ordinarily approved for periods longer than 12 months at a time, 

except in situations which are in the best interests of FEMA or the U.S. 
Government, such as Peace Corps volunteers. 

G.  LWOP may not be retroactively substituted for annual or sick leave (see 58 

Comp. Gen. 661). 

H.  Employees may not be granted LWOP for the sole purpose of pursuing or 

engaging in outside employment. Outside employment includes any position 
or opportunity, including internships, for which the employee receives a 
monetary payment.  

11-2.  Required LWOP Situations 

Employees are entitled to LWOP under the following circumstances: 

A.  The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), provides covered 

employees with an entitlement to a total of up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave 
(LWOP) during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs 
(see Chapters 5 and 6 and 5 C.F.R. Part 630, Subpart L). 

B.  The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 
provides employees with an entitlement to LWOP when employment with 
FEMA is interrupted by a period of service in the uniformed service (see 5 
C.F.R. § 353.106). 

C.  Executive Order 5396, dated July 17, 1930, provides that disabled veterans 

are entitled to LWOP for necessary medical treatment. 

D.  Employees receiving workers’ compensation payments from the Department 

of Labor must be placed in an LWOP status. 

60 

 
 
11-3.  Approving LWOP 

A.  An employee’s immediate supervisor may only approve LWOP of up to 80 

hours. 

B.  Heads of Offices or Directorates must approve any periods of LWOP 

exceeding 80 hours. 

C.  Heads of Offices or Directorates may approve up to six months of LWOP. 
Extensions of LWOP over six months must be approved by OCCHCO. 

D.  If the period of LWOP is more than 30 calendar days, an SF-52 is required to 

provide documentation in the employee’s Official Personnel Folder. 

E.  When approving extended periods of LWOP, there should be a reasonable 
expectation that the employee will return to duty at the conclusion of the 
period of LWOP. 

11-4.  LWOP for Family Obligations 

Supervisors are allowed, at their discretion, to approve up to 24 hours of LWOP 
per year for employees to balance the demands of family and work. LWOP for 
general family care purposes differs from LWOP under FMLA in that LWOP for 
general family purposes is not an entitlement and must be approved by an 
employee’s supervisor, and there is no right to substitute paid leave for unpaid 
leave used. An employee may be granted up to 24 hours of LWOP, if other leave 
is not available to: 

A.  Attend school and early childhood educational activities that are directly 
related to the educational advancement of an employee’s child, such as 
tutoring or attending school board meetings. Schools under this heading refer 
to elementary and secondary schools, Head Start programs, or child-care 
facilities. 

B.  Accompany child to routine medical, dental, or optical appointments when no 

sick leave is available. 

C.  Accompany elderly relatives to routine medical, dental, optical, or other 

professional service appointments that are directly related to the care of an 
elderly relative. LWOP for this purpose is in addition to an employee’s 
entitlement to sick leave for general family care and LWOP under FMLA. 

11-5.  Extended Use of LWOP 

Extended periods of LWOP may be authorized sparingly if the value to FEMA, 
the U.S. Government, or the serious personal needs of the employee are 
sufficient to offset the costs and administrative inconveniences involved, 
including encumbrance of a position, loss of needed services, complication of 
retention registers for reduction in force, obligation to provide employment at the 
end of the period of leave, and credit for six months of each year of absence 

61 

 
 
 
toward retirement (or full credit for those in receipt of disability compensation). If 
the circumstances warrant an extended LWOP subject to the approving 
requirements above, extended periods of LWOP may be authorized for: 

A.  Education that contributes to the interests or mission of FEMA; 

B.  Recovery from illness or disability not of a permanent nature, when continued 
employment or immediate return to employment might impair the employee’s 
health or the health of other employees; or 

C.  If the disability or disease is one for which the employee is being 

compensated by the Department of Labor under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, LWOP 
in excess of one year may be granted in increments appropriate to the 
employee’s prospects for recovery. 

11-6.  Effect of LWOP on Employee Benefits 

A.  If an employee is in a non-pay status for an entire pay period, the employee 
will not earn annual or sick leave for that pay period. Periods in a non-pay 
status are calculated on a cumulative basis during a leave year. For every 80 
hours in a LWOP status, an employee’s annual and sick leave amounts will 
be reduced by the amount of leave the employee would have earned during 
that pay period.  

B.  Employees on LWOP due to a compensable on-the-job injury will not earn 

annual or sick leave while in a LWOP status. 

C.  Employees cannot be paid for a legal holiday if they are in a non-pay status 
on the workday before and workday after a holiday. Employees who are on 
extended periods of LWOP may not return to duty for the sole reason of being 
paid for a holiday. 

D.  Employees may continue to receive health insurance under the Federal 
Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) program for up to 365 days while in a 
LWOP status. Employees are still obligated to pay their portion of their health 
premiums while they are in a non-pay status. 

E.  Employees covered by the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) 
will automatically retain their coverage at no cost for up to 365 days while in a 
LWOP status. After 365 days, employees will have the option to convert their 
FEGLI coverage to an individual life insurance policy and pay all premiums. 

F.  Periods of LWOP in excess of six months in a calendar year will be deducted 
from creditable service toward retirement, except for absences for military 
duty or caused by a compensable on-the-job injury (see 5 U.S.C § 8332(f)). 

G.  Employees will not be able to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) 

during periods of LWOP. 

H.  For employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System 
(FERS), the Federal Government will discontinue contributions, both 
automatic and matching, to an employee’s account. 

62 

 
 
I.  Unless the LWOP is taken for military duty or as a result of a compensable 
on-the-job injury, the waiting period for a within grade increase will be 
extended by the amount of time which exceeds (see 5 C.F.R. § 531.406): 

1.  Two work weeks if the employee is at step 1, 2, or 3; 

2.  Four work weeks if the employee is at step 4, 5, or 6; or 

3.  Six work weeks if the employee is at step 7, 8, or 9. 

J.  For more information on the effects of LWOP and other non-pay categories 

have on salary and benefits see Appendix C.

VOLUNTARY LEAVE TRANSFER PROGRAM 

12-1.  Program Description and Eligibility 

A.  The Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (VLTP) allows eligible employees to 
donate annual leave or receive donated annual leave from other Federal 
employees in response to a medical emergency. 

B.  A leave recipient must face a substantial loss of income and use or expect to 
use all of his or her accrued annual and sick leave in response to a medical 
emergency. 

C.  Employees cannot donate leave to an immediate supervisor, any individual in 

their supervisory or management chain of command, or any other 
management official within FEMA having an influence or input on personnel 
actions involving the leave donor. 

D.  Employees may not solicit personal donations for leave, directly or indirectly, 

from other employees. 

E.  Employees will not be eligible for the VLTP for any of the following purposes: 

1.  Caring for or bonding with a healthy newborn child; 

2.  Recuperating from elective or cosmetic surgery; or 

3.  Absences related to bereavement. 

12-2.  Application to be a Leave Recipient 

A.  Employees seeking donated leave must submit an application including: 

1.  The name, position title, and grade or pay level of the leave recipient; 

2.  The reasons why donated leave is requested, including a description of 

the nature, severity, and anticipated duration of the medical emergency. If 
the medical emergency is a reoccurring condition, the employee must 
state the approximate frequency and duration of each reoccurrence;  

3.  A copy of the employee’s current annual and sick leave balance; and 

4.  Certification by the employee’s physician(s) or experts attesting to the 

nature of the medical emergency. 

B.  If the employee is unable to complete the application, a personal 

representative of the employee may prepare and submit an application on the 
employee’s behalf. 

12-3.  Approval 

A.  Employees, or their representative, will submit an application to become a 

leave recipient to the employee’s supervisor of record.  

64 

 
 
 
B.  The supervisor of record will review the application to ensure the employee 
meets the eligibility criteria: the employee will be absent from duty without 
available paid leave for at least 24 hours or 30% of the employee’s average 
biweekly scheduled tour of duty (for part-time employees or employees with 
an uncommon tour of duty), and the absence is due to a medical emergency 
affecting the employee or a covered family member. 

C.  The employee’s supervisor of record will submit approved applications to 

OCCHCO. OCCHCO will review the application and notify the employee or 
representative if the application is approved. If the application is not 
approved, OCCHCO will state the reason(s) for the disapproval. 

D.  Leave donors may only donate leave to an employee after an employee’s 

application is approved. 

12-4.  Transfer of Annual Leave 

A.  Once an employee is approved to receive donated leave, other FEMA 

employees may submit a written request to donate a specified number of 
annual leave hours to an eligible leave recipient.  

B.  Transferred annual leave may be used retroactively for periods of LWOP or to 
liquate a debt of advanced annual or sick leave associated with the medical 
emergency. 

C.  Usually, FEMA will only transfer donated leave between FEMA employees. 
However, FEMA will accept leave donations through the VLTP under the 
following circumstances: 

1.  When a family member of the leave recipient is employed by another 
agency and requests to transfer annual leave to the leave recipient; 

2.  When OCCHCO determines that the amount of leave available for transfer 
from other FEMA employees may not be sufficient to meet the needs of 
the leave recipient; or 

3.  When OCCHCO determines that accepting leave donations from other 

agencies would further the purpose of the VLTP. 

12-5.  Donations of Annual Leave 

A.  A leave donor must donate at least one hour of leave and in increments of 

one hour. 

B.  A leave donor can only donate annual leave. 

C.  A leave donor may donate no more than one-half of the amount of annual 

leave he or she will earn during the leave year. 

D.  A leave donor who is projected to have leave subject to forfeiture may donate 
the lesser of one-half of the amount of leave the donor will accrue during the 

65 

 
 
 
leave year or the amount of leave the donor is scheduled to accrue until the 
end of the leave year. 

12-6.  Use of Transferred Annual Leave 

A.  A leave recipient must use all of his or her annual, sick, or other available 
paid leave accrued or accumulated before using any transferred leave.  

B.  Leave recipients may only use donated leave for the medical emergency 

stated in the leave application. 

12-7.  Accrual of Annual and Sick Leave 

An employee using donated leave will continue to accrue annual and sick leave, 
at the employee’s normal rate, until the employee accrues forty hours of annual 
and sick leave (or in the case of an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the 
average number of hours in the employee’s weekly scheduled tour of duty). In 
the case of annual leave, the employee will accrue annual leave to the extent 
necessary to reduce any indebtedness caused by an advance of annual leave. 
The accrued annual and sick leave will be placed in a set aside account during 
the period of the medical emergency. A leave recipient may use such leave after 
the end of the medical emergency or if all donated leave is exhausted.  

12-8.  Termination of the Medical Emergency 

The medical emergency ends when: 

A.  The leave recipient notifies OCCHCO in writing that the medical emergency 

no longer exists; 

B.  OCCHCO determines, after written notice and opportunity  for the leave 
recipient (or, if appropriate, another person acting on behalf of the leave 
recipient) to answer orally or in writing, that the medical emergency no longer 
exists; 

C.  OCCHCO receives notice that the leave recipient is approved for a disability 

retirement; or 

D.  The leave recipient separates from FEMA. 

12-9.  Restoration of Transferred Annual Leave 

A.  When the medical emergency affecting a leave recipient ends, any remaining 
donated leave shall be restored on a prorated basis to the appropriate leave 
donors. 

B.  Donated leave will not be restored if: 

1.  The amount of leave to be restored is less than one hour; or 

66 

 
 
 
 
 
2.  If the leave donor retires, dies, or separates from FEMA before the date 

OCCHCO is notified that donated leave is eligible for restoration. 

C.  The leave donor may elect to receive the restored leave by: 

1.  Crediting such leave to the annual leave account for the current leave 

year; 

2.  Crediting such leave to annual leave account effective as of the first day of 

the first leave year beginning after the date of the election; or 

3.  Donating such leave, in whole or in part, to another leave recipient. 

12-10. Prohibition of Coercion 

A.  The decision to donate leave must be completely voluntary. An employee 
may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce, or promise any 
benefit to any other employee for the purpose of influencing or interfering with 
any employee’s decision to donate, receive, or use annual leave. 

B.  For the purpose of paragraph A of this section, the terms "intimidate, threaten, 
or coerce" includes promising to confer or conferring any benefit (such as an 
appointment, promotion, or compensation) or effecting or threatening to effect 
any reprisal (such as deprivation of appointment, promotion, or 
compensation). 

67 

 
 
 
 
13-1.  Transfer of Leave 

TRANSFER AND RECREDIT OF LEAVE 

A.  When an employee transfers between positions with the same leave system 
as FEMA, without a break in service, the agency the employee is transferring 
from shall certify the employee’s annual leave account to the employing 
agency for credit or recharge (see 5 U.S.C. 6306, 5 C.F.R. 630.501, and 5 
C.F.R. 630.502). 

B.  When an employee transfers between positions with a different leave system 
than FEMA’s, without a break in service, 7 calendar days of annual leave are 
deemed equal to 5 workdays of annual leave (5 C.F.R. 630.501). 

C.  Only annual leave in whole hour units may be transferred between Federal 

agencies. 

13-2.  Recredit of Sick Leave 

A.  When an employee transfers between positions with the same sick leave 
system as FEMA, without a break in service, the agency the employee is 
transferring from shall certify the employee’s sick leave account to the 
employing agency for credit or recharge (see 5 C.F.R. § 630.502(a)). 

B.  When an employee transfers between positions with a different leave system 
than FEMA’s, without a break in service, 7 calendar days of annual leave are 
deemed equal to 5 workdays of annual leave (5 C.F.R. 630.502 (d)). 

C.  An employee who has had a break in service is entitled to a recredit to sick 

leave (without regard to the date of his or her separation), if he or she returns 
to Federal employment on or after December 2, 1994, unless the sick leave 
was forfeited upon reemployment in the Federal Government before 
December 2, 1994 (5 C.F.R. 630.502 (b)). 

D.  Only sick leave in whole hour units may be transferred between Federal 

agencies.

APPENDIX C: LWOP 

The following chart outlines some of the effects that the use of LWOP and other non-
pay categories have on salary and benefits. 

Topic 

Number of Days/Hours in a Non-Pay Status Allowed 
Without a Penalty 

Initial Appointment 
Probationary Period 

Any non-pay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the 
probationary period by that number of days. 

Supervisory/Managerial 
Probationary Period 

Any non-pay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the 
probationary period by that number of days. 

Career Tenure 

Leave 

Service Credit for 
Annual Leave Accrual 
(advancement to 
earning 6 and 8 hours 
per pay period) 

Any non-pay time in excess of 30 calendar days for each 
period of absence extends the service date for career 
tenure by that number of days. 

If an employee is in a non-pay status for an entire pay 
period, no annual or sick leave is earned for that pay period. 
If non-pay time occurs during part of one or more of a full-
time employee’s pay periods, the employee continues to 
earn leave until the non-pay time totals 80 hours. Then 
leave is reduced by the amount the employee earns during 
a pay period. 
6 months of non-pay time is creditable. Advancement to 
higher leave accrual category is delayed by the amount of 
non-pay time in excess of 6 months in one calendar year.

Federal Employees 
Group Life (FEGLI) 
Coverage 

FEGLI Coverage continues without cost to the employee for 
up to 12 months in non-pay status. Coverage is terminated 
after employee has been in non-pay status for 12 months. 
(Previous time in non-pay status counts toward the 12 
months if the employee does not return to duty in between 
periods of non-pay status for at least 4 consecutive 
months.) 

Federal Employee 
Health Benefits (FEHB) 
Coverage 

Unless the employee cancels or temporarily terminates the 
enrollment, coverage generally continues for up to 365 days 
in non-pay status. During periods of LWOP, the employee is 
liable for his or her full share of the premiums for this period. 

Retirement 

6 months of non-pay time is creditable service. Service 
credit is adjusted by the amount of non-pay time in excess 
of 6 months in one calendar year.

Foreword 

This Manual provides guidance and policy direction for the administration, 
implementation, and oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s 
(FEMA) Detail Program. 

A detail is a temporary assignment to a different position or unclassified duties for a 
specified period when the employee is expected to return to his or her regular duties at 
the end of the assignment. Details are an effective tool to enable FEMA to meet mission 
requirements and allow employees to gain experience performing different roles and 
responsibilities. Details may be used to satisfy emergency workloads, complete short-
term or special projects, minimize the use of overtime due to temporary staffing 
shortages, maintain positions pending a reduction-in-force or reorganization, or to 
accomplish FEMA or DHS operational needs. 

Managers and supervisors must use the policies and procedures prescribed herein to 
ensure details are made in accordance with applicable Federal laws and regulations.

2-1.  Purpose of Details 

INTRODUCTION TO DETAILS 

Details may be used to complete emergency or short-term projects; satisfy 
temporary unmet workload requirements; maintain office functions during a 
reorganization, reduction-in-force, or rightsizing; or to accomplish the mission 
requirements of FEMA or other Federal agencies. Supervisors and managers 
must follow the proper policies and procedures to fairly and accurately affect 
personnel actions.  

2-2.  Types of Details 

A.  Internal or External Details. Internal details involve FEMA employees detailed 
to another position within FEMA or to perform unclassified duties within FEMA 
(the policies and procedures for internal details are discussed in Chapter 3). 
External details involve FEMA employees detailed to, or a non-FEMA 
employee detailed from the White House, Congress, DHS Headquarters, 
another DHS Component, other Federal agencies, or international 
organizations (specific policies and procedures applicable for such details are 
discussed in Chapter 5). 

B.  Details to Classified Positions or Unclassified Duties. A detail may be made to 
fill a vacant classified position or complete a set of unclassified duties. If a 
detail is to a classified position, the classified position must be documented 
through a position description. If a detail is to unclassified duties, a statement 
of duties must be prepared by the gaining organization prior to the start date 
of the detail, outlining: 

1.  The duties and responsibilities of the position; 

2.  The purpose of the unclassified duties; and 

3.  The expected duration of the detail. 

C.  Reimbursable or Non-Reimbursable Details. Internal FEMA details will be 
made on a non-reimbursable basis for salary and benefits if the funding 
source does not change. If the detailee’s funding source must be changed for 
an internal FEMA detail, the detail must be made on a reimbursable basis. 
Subject to the exceptions listed below, the employing organization is 
reimbursed by the gaining organization for salaries and expenses that stem 
from a detail. An Office or Directorate that believes that a proposed  detail 
falls into one of the exceptions below must seek a legal opinion from OCC 
prior to executing the detail. 

1.  Absent specific statutory authority, all internal details involving a change in 
funding sources, and external details of FEMA employees to other Federal 
agencies should be on a reimbursable basis, unless the detail: 

14 

 
 
i. 

Involves a matter relating to the employing organization’s 
appropriations and will aid in the purpose for which the appropriations 
were provided; 

ii.  Is legislatively mandated as non-reimbursable;  

iii.  Is documented in a Memorandum of Agreement; or 

iv.  Involves the detail of a CORE to a non-Stafford Act function as 

described in sections 4-2 and 4-3.  

2.  Details to the White House, Congress, or to other Federal agencies 

(including DHS Headquarters and DHS Components) may be made on a 
non-reimbursable basis. If a detail is authorized on a non-reimbursable 
basis, the employing Office or Directorate must prepare a memorandum, 
approved by OCC and, the Administrator or Deputy Administrator, 
justifying the detail. The memorandum must address, at a minimum, the 
following issues: 

i.  How the detail will support or advance FEMA’s mission or operations; 

ii.  How the detail falls into one of the exceptions listed in section 2-2.C.1.; 

iii.  The impact on the Office’s or Directorate’s workload and operations; 

iv.  The impact of the detail on the Office’s or Directorate’s budget; 

v.  How the detail will benefit the employee’s professional or career 

development; 

vi.  How any potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues will be 

addressed; and 

vii. The impact of the detail on similarly situated employees. 

3.  Reimbursable external details must be accompanied by an MOA and an 

Inter/Intra-Agency Reimbursable Work Agreement (IRWA). The applicable 
FEMA Office or Directorate will be responsible for negotiating and 
finalizing an MOA and IRWA with the other agency or component, in 
coordination with  OCFO, OCCHCO, and OCC. For details between 
FEMA and other Federal agencies outside of DHS or international 
organizations, the completed MOA and IRWA must be provided to DHS 
OCHCO. For more information on the requirements for the MOA see 
Section 5-8. 

15 

 
 
 
3-1.  General Provisions 

INTERNAL FEMA DETAILS 

A.  The servicing HR Liaison must be consulted prior to detailing any employee. 

B.  Supervisors should seek input from employees regarding details, but 

employee consent is not required when placing an employee on a detail. 

C.  Supervisors and managers have the discretion to detail an employee. The 

decision to detail an employee should be based on the employing 
organization’s ability to spare the services of the employee without detriment 
to the organization or hiring additional staff. 

D.  The gaining organization shall initiate the request for a detail assignment by 
providing an SF-52 and a position description or statement of work to the 
organization’s servicing HR Liaison (for internal details) or OCCHCO (for 
external details).  

E.  Detailed employees must meet the position sensitivity or risk designation of 

the detail position. 

F.  An employee does not need to meet the minimum qualification requirements 

of the position to which he or she is detailed. An employee does need to meet 
any minimum educational, licensure, or certification requirements of a 
position. 

G.  Employees must have an “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent on their last 
performance review, and not be subject to an ongoing investigation into 
allegations of misconduct to be eligible for a detail. Employees employed for 
more than 90 days without an official performance rating will be considered to 
be at the “Achieved Expectations” or equivalent level. 

H.  An employee may be detailed to a position that is classified at the same, 

lower, or higher grade as the employee’s permanent position of record. If an 
employee is detailed to a higher graded position, FEMA is not required to pay 
the employee at a higher rate of pay. If the Office or Directorate decides to 
pay a detailee at a higher rate, the Office or Directorate must state that the 
selected employee will receive a higher rate of pay before the start of the 
detail, and the action will be processed as a temporary promotion according 
to the Merit Promotion Manual (see FM 253-11-1, Merit Promotion and 
Internal Placement). 

I.  Details may be approved for up to 120 day increments. A detail will 

automatically terminate after a 120 day period unless the gaining organization 
requests and is granted an extension. Requests to extend a detail must be 
made 30 days prior to the end of the detail to OCCHCO and the employee’s 
supervisor of record for review and approval. Upon a written request, 
OCCHCO may grant a waiver of this requirement. 

16 

 
J.  The total duration of all noncompetitive details to higher-graded positions and 
noncompetitive time-limited promotions within the prior 12-month period will 
count toward the 120-day total for time served on a detail. 

K.  Service while on a detail is credited for time-in-grade purposes at the grade of 

the employee’s position of record. 

L.  A detail will not change an employee’s position of record, conditions of 

employment, or benefits. 

M.  OCCHCO will ensure employees on a detail assignment receive notice of 

vacancy announcements and training opportunities. 

N.  Details may be terminated at any time at the request of the employee’s 

supervisor of record or the gaining organization. 

O.  Employees hired under a new Federal competitive service appointment are 

subject to the 90 day restriction on movement after a competitive appointment 
(see 5 C.F.R. § 330.502). As such, they may not be detailed during the first 
90 days of their appointment, without OPM approval. 

3-2.  Ability to Detail an Employee 

A.  FEMA may detail an employee in the competitive service to a position in 

either the competitive or excepted service. 

B.  FEMA may detail an employee in the excepted service to another position in 
the excepted service. If the employee was hired under Schedule A, Schedule 
B, or through a Veterans Recruitment Appointment, FEMA may detail the 
employee to a position in the competitive or excepted service. 

C.  Absent OPM approval after DHS OCHCO review and concurrence, FEMA 
may only detail an employee in the excepted service not hired under 
Schedule A, Schedule B, or through a Veterans Recruitment Appointment to 
another position in the excepted service. 

3-3.  Non-Competitive Details 

A.  Supervisors of record or managers in the employee’s supervisory chain of 
command may approve a detail for up to 30 days. Details in excess of 30 
days must be approved at least by the employee’s second level supervisor. 
Upon written request, OCCHCO may grant a waiver of this requirement. 

B.  An employee may be detailed to a position at the same grade, lower grade, 
higher grade, or to a position with greater promotion potential than the 
employee’s permanent position of record without competition for up to 120 
days in total if the employee has not served an aggregate of 120 days in the 
detail position in the previous 12 months. Any extension beyond 120 days 
must be advertised and competed.   

17 

 
 
 
C.  An employee may be detailed to a position with unclassified duties for up to 
120 days without competition in total. Any extension beyond 120 days must 
be advertised and competed. 

3-4.  Competitive Details 

A.  Details in excess of 120 days or extended beyond the initial 120 day period 

must be advertised and made through competitive procedures. 

B.  The advertisement must state whether the incumbent of the position can be 
non-competitively converted to the position at the end of the detail period. 

3-5.  Competitive Procedures 

When a detail is required to be advertised and competed, the gaining Office or 
Directorate must consult with the appropriate servicing HR Specialist to advertise 
and compete the detail. 

3-6.  SES Details 

A.  Details of SES members may be made for up to 240 days, in no more than 

120 day increments. 

B.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 3395, details of career SES members cannot be used 
to circumvent the advance notice requirement for reassignments, or the 120 
day moratorium on involuntary reassignments following the appointment of a 
new Administrator or other non-career supervisor. 

C.  FEMA may not detail an SES member to unclassified duties for more than 

120 days. 

D.  Only career SES and non-SES employees may be detailed to an SES career 

reserved position. 

E.  Details of Non-SES Employees to SES Positions and SES Employees to 

Non-SES Positions. 

1.  Details of non-SES employees to SES positions and SES employees to 
non-SES positions should be rare and must be approved by OCCHCO. 

2.  Merit promotion procedures must be used to detail a non-SES employee 
to an SES position for more than 240 days. Competition is not required if 
the non-SES employee is eligible for a noncompetitive SES appointment 
(e.g., a Qualifications Review Board certified graduate of an SES 
Candidate Development Program). 

3.  A non-SES employee detailed to an SES position must complete all ethics 
and financial disclosure statements necessary for the position prior to 
beginning the detail. 

18 

 
 
 
 
4.  The duties and responsibilities of a vacant SES position may be 

temporarily restructured to classify the position as a non-SES position, so 
that a non-SES employee may be detailed to the vacant position. 

F.  FEMA must gain OPM approval, through the DHS CHCO, to: 

1.  Detail a non-SES employee to an SES position that supervises other SES 

positions for more than 240 days; or 

2.  Detail an SES employee to a position at the GS-15 or equivalent level or 

below for more than 240 days. 

3-7.  Supervisory Status 

Employees may be non-competitively detailed to a supervisory position for up to 
120 days. If managers and supervisors detail an employee to a supervisory or 
managerial position for more than 30 days, consideration should be given to all 
eligible, similarly situated employees (i.e., rotate the detail among eligible 
employees) or consider the use of a temporary promotion. Employees detailed to 
such positions will continue to encumber their position of record, and will not 
become the official supervisor of record for any employees who would normally 
report to the position. In such instances, either the employee holding the 
supervisory position as his or her position of record, or the second level 
supervisor, will serve as the supervisor of record. 

3-8.  Work Schedule and Telework 

The mission and operational requirements of a detail may require modification to 
an employee’s current work or telework schedules. The employee’s supervisor of 
record and detail supervisor should coordinate any necessary modifications to an 
employee’s existing work or telework schedule; however, the supervisor of record 
retains the authority to approve, modify, or rescind an employee’s work or 
telework schedule while on a detail. The supervisor of record and the employee’s 
permanent timekeeper will be responsible for certifying and maintaining an 
employee’s time and attendance records during a detail, including approval of 
leave. 

3-9.  Performance Management 

Any employee who is expected to be on detail for more than 90 days will be 
provided an updated performance plan by the employee’s supervisor of record. 
The plan must be adjusted to account for performance goals associated with the 
employee’s position of record, and incorporating performance goals related to the 
detail. Employees who are expected to be on a detail for more than 90 days will 
also be provided with performance feedback and detail supervisor. The 
supervisor of record maintains the responsibility for completing an employee’s 
quarterly and annual appraisals. At the end of a performance cycle the official 
supervisor of record will complete the rating of record, giving consideration to any 
feedback received from the detail supervisor. For details of 90 days or less, the 

19 

 
 
 
 
employee’s performance plan may be updated by the supervisor of record to 
incorporate goals related to the detail, and the supervisor of record may seek 
feedback from the detail supervisor in order to complete the employee’s quarterly 
and annual appraisals. 

3-10.  Discipline and Adverse Actions 

Detail supervisors will document allegations of misconduct or poor performance 
according to FEMA policy and procedures. Detail supervisors must consult with 
the official permanent supervisor of record who shall consult with OCCHCO 
Employee Relations to receive guidance on how to resolve the allegation. The 
supervisor of record will coordinate with OCCHCO/Employee Relations for 
guidance before initiating disciplinary action.  

3-11.  Reduction-in-Force, Transfer of Function, and Rightsizing 

A.  An employee’s position, competitive area, and duty station is determined by 
the employee’s permanent position description and official duty station. 

B.  Positions or duty stations assigned to an employee through a detail do not 

establish an employee’s official position, competitive area, or duty station for 
Reduction-in-Force, Transfer of Function, or Rightsizing actions. 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
4-1.  Details to Perform Stafford Act Activities 

CORE DETAILS 

A.  COREs are hired on a temporary basis under FEMA’s Stafford Act 

appointment authority. The salary and benefits paid to a CORE are funded by 
the DRF, thus the duties and responsibilities of a CORE must predominately 
support Stafford Act activities. COREs may be detailed to a position to 
perform other Stafford Act activities (in rare circumstances, COREs may be 
detailed to perform non-Stafford Act activities, see sections 4-2 and 4-3). 

B.  COREs may be temporarily placed on a detail to carry out a discrete function. 
Absent approval from OPM, a CORE may not be detailed to a competitive 
service position. An Office or Directorate requesting a CORE detail must have 
an available CORE position (see section 2-2 of FM 252-11-1, Cadre of On-
Call Response/Recovery Employee (CORE)). 

C.  A CORE may be placed on a detail for up to 120 days that may be renewed 
for one additional 120 day period. OCCHCO must approve a CORE detailed 
to a position for more than 120 days or to positions at a higher grade for any 
duration. If exceeding 120 days, the detail must be advertised and competed. 
A CORE placed on a detail may not be detailed to a position beyond his or 
her appointment term unless the CORE’s appointment is renewed. 

4-2.  Non-Stafford Act Mission and Operational Details 

The Administrator is vested with the authority to carry out all of FEMA’s statutory 
missions and functions. Upon a determination by the Administrator that urgent 
and compelling circumstances exist in order to carry out FEMA’s mission or to 
support other Federal agency incident operations, a CORE may be placed on a 
detail to perform non-Stafford Act activities under the following conditions: 

A.  The detail shall not exceed 90 days per appointment term; 

B.  The detailed CORE’s salary, benefits, and associated expenses must be paid 
from the account normally charged for carrying out the gaining program or 
activity for the duration of the detail; and 

C.  Training activities and other duties needed to prepare a CORE for a mission 

or operational detail may be conducted outside of the 90 day detail period, but 
must be justified and approved in advance. In such circumstances, the 
training time and the detail time, will be charged to the gaining organization. 

4-3.  Non-Stafford Act Training Details 

With OCCHCO and OCC approval, a CORE may be authorized to complete a 
non-Stafford Act training detail under the following conditions: 

A.  A determination must be made that the training of the CORE, and thus the 

increased ability of that CORE to carry out future Stafford Act activities, is the 
primary purpose and benefit of the non-Stafford Act detail; 

21 

 
 
 
B.  The detail may not exceed 30 days without a determination that a detail of 

more than 30 days is warranted; 

C.  Extensions beyond the initial 30 days must be approved every 30 days 
thereafter and shall not exceed 90 days per appointment term; and 

D.  The detailed CORE’s salary, benefits, and expenses, must be reimbursed by 

the gaining program, office, or agency. 

4-4.  Restrictions on the Use of Non-Stafford Act Details 

COREs performing non-Stafford Act activities must be justified as either an 
urgent and compelling mission or operational detail or a training detail. Under no 
circumstances, may FEMA use both justifications for the same non-Stafford Act 
detail. In both instances, the CORE is limited to one non-Stafford Act detail per 
appointment. 

22 

 
 
 
 
5-1. 

Introduction 

EXTERNAL DETAILS 

The policies and procedures of this Chapter are in addition to, or modify the

5-7. 

Intergovernmental Personnel Act Assignments 

FEMA employees participating in an IPA assignment may be placed in a detail or 
LWOP status during the assignment period. The policies and procedures for 
placing a FEMA employee on an IPA assignment are discussed in FEMA 
Directive 252-7, Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA), dated August 4, 2015. 

24 

 
  
 
 
 
5-8.  Memorandums of Agreement 

A.  When a MOA is required to document a detail, the terms of the agreement 

should at least address the following issues:

MOA with the participating entity. If the detail involves an exchange of funds, 
the Office or Directorate will confer with OCFO to draft and execute an IRWA. 

C.  The MOA must be reviewed and approved by OCCHCO and OCC before the 

MOA is finalized. The MOA must then be approved by the head of the 
participating Office or Directorate; the responsible official from the 
participating entity; and if a FEMA employee will be detailed from FEMA, the 
employee’s supervisor of record. 

D.  If the MOA obligates FEMA to pay for any portion of the costs associated with 
hosting a detailee, including but not limited to, the salary, benefits, expenses,

Foreword 

This Manual provides guidance and policy direction for the administration, implementation, and 
oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Telework Program. FEMA 
considers telecommuting to be a viable alternative work arrangement in cases where individual, job, 
and supervisor characteristics are best suited to such an arrangement. Teleworking allows an 
employee to work at home or other approved alternative work locations during regular working 
hours. Teleworking is a voluntary work alternative that may be appropriate for some employees and 
some jobs. It is not an entitlement and in no way changes the terms and conditions of employment with 
the Agency.

CHAPTER 1: GENERAL INFORMATION 

1-1. Purpose 

The purpose of telework is to complete the duties, responsibilities, and other authorized activities 
(such as online training) of an employee’s official position from an alternative worksite, other than 
at the location an employee normally works.  The availability of telework promotes recruitment 
and retention; helps employees manage commutes and other work/life issues; reduces traffic 
congestion, fuel consumption and vehicle emissions; reduces real estate costs; and ensures 
continuity of essential governmental functions in the event of an emergency.  This Manual 
prescribes policy and assigns responsibility for telework. It details position and employee 
eligibility determinations for teleworking. It also addresses performance management of the 
teleworker and provides guidance on security considerations for teleworking. 

1-2. Applicability and Scope 

This Manual applies to all FEMA employees as defined in Title 5 Section 2105 of the United 
States Code, except those excluded from coverage under Pub. L. No. 111-292, Section 6502, 
and those employees deemed ineligible by the Agency to participate in the telework 
program. 

1-3. Supersession  

This Telework policy supersedes FEMA Manual 3000.3, Program Guidance for FEMA 
Telework Program, dated July 31, 2000.

1-5. Policy 

A.  FEMA promotes telework (also known as flexiplace, telecommuting, or work-from-home) as 
a workplace flexibility for recruiting top talent; retaining current employees; reducing the 
cost of office space, absenteeism, and use of workers compensation; and to ensure 
continuity of essential governmental functions in the event of an emergency. 

B.  The FEMA telework program embraces the premise that all positions are presumed 
suitable for telework, unless the official duties require, on a daily basis, an employee to be 
physically present at a worksite because the employee’s duties cannot be performed 
remotely or from an alternate worksite, or that the employee’s duties require the frequent 
and direct handling of sensitive materials inappropriate for telework. 

C.  All eligible employees will be afforded every opportunity to participate in the telework 
program. Employees in occupations typically deemed ineligible for telework who are 
working on rotations or temporary details that include work that is eligible for telework may 
participate in the telework program. See criteria in Section 2-2, Determining Eligibility, for 
further discussion of eligibility requirements. 

D.  Employees participating in the telework program will be provided with the necessary 

government equipment and supplies to adequately perform their tasks at an alternate 
worksite as detailed in Section 3-6, Security and Equipment. 

E.  Telework may be executed either 1) on a regular and recurring basis, meaning that the 
employee teleworks at least one day or more a pay period or 2) on a situational or 
episodic basis, that occurs on an occasional, non-routine circumstance and/or during 
COOP/pandemic health crisis, individual employee medical reasons, or other emergency 
situations. 

F.  Telework for more than one day a pay period may be appropriate for attracting potential 
applicants, retaining current employees, and providing reasonable accommodations for 
employees in accordance with guidance by Office of Equal Rights (OER), as well as for 
accommodating employees housed in Federal buildings undergoing renovation projects 
and for addressing other agency or employee needs. 

G.  Unscheduled situational telework is an important component of FEMA’s ability to operate in 

emergencies. Telework should be incorporated into emergency preparedness operations to 
the broadest extent possible. Unscheduled telework is a way for FEMA and its employees 

5 

 
 
to maintain productivity and help ensure safety of the Federal workforce and the public. For 
example, telework will be considered for situational inclement weather as well as 
emergency situations that involve national security, extended emergencies, or other unique 
situations (See Section 3-9 Emergency Situations). 

H.  As part of FEMA Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP), positions may be designated as 

Mission Critical. These designations should be an integral part of the COOP planning and 
emergency occupant plans. As such, each organization should test its preparedness at 
least annually for an all-staff telework emergency by conducting an exercise where all 
eligible employees telework for at least one day (See Section 3-10).  Designation as Mission 
Critical means the employee in the position is deemed an Emergency Employee for 
purposes of Para. 1-6.H.  

I.  Telework will be considered when planning for any building renovation in any agency 

location, especially where workspace sharing (e.g., hoteling) is required. 

J.  An approved and up-to-date agreement is required for any teleworking arrangement. The 
agreement should outline emergency designations when applicable and allow easy 
implementation for unscheduled telework in emergency or unforeseen situations where 
teleworking may be appropriate. 

K.  Telework training is required for all new teleworkers and their managers before he/she 
begins a telework arrangement.  Employees with telework agreements may also be 
required to undergo periodic retraining.  

L.  Agencies/staff offices must include an appropriate notice in all eligible vacancy 

announcements when the position is eligible for telework. For example, "The duties of this 
position can be performed while teleworking” or “This position is eligible for telework and 
other flexible work arrangements.” 

M.  Telework may be considered appropriate as an accommodation for employees who meet 

reasonable accommodation guidelines in alignment with the Office of Equal Rights (OER). 

N.  If an employee teleworks full time, supervisors must coordinate with Office of Chief 

Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO)  to ensure the employee is aware of any 
impact to pay or benefits that may result from the arrangement (See Section 3-3, Official 
Duty Station). 

O.  Employee performance for teleworkers and non-teleworkers will be evaluated using the 
same performance management program and standards that cover workers at traditional 
office/duty locations. This includes providing all employees the same opportunities and 
treatment with regards to work assignments, periodic appraisal of job performance, awards, 
recognition, training and developmental opportunities, promotions, and retention incentives. 

P.  Teleworking  employees  are  subject  to  ensuring  that  records  subject  to  Privacy  Act  and 
sensitive  or  classified  data  are  not  disclosed  to  anyone  except  those  who  are  authorized 
access  to  such  information  in  order  to  perform  their  duties.  Individuals  may  not  remove 
classified data from employees’ official work sites to alternate worksite locations. 

Q.  Teleworking employees continue to be bound by DHS and FEMA standards of conduct and 

performance directives and policies while working at the alternate worksite. 

6 

 
 
R.  Employees rights provided for in the collective bargaining agreement are not affected by 

participation in the telework program. 

S.  Employees can both telework and participate in an Alternate Work Schedule (AWS). 

However, a program office can restrict the combination of the usage of both programs 
by an employee if it negatively impacts  mission accomplishment. 

1-6.  Definitions 

A.  Alternative Work Schedules (AWS):  Work schedules that differ from traditional fixed work 
schedules (e.g., 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week).  There are two categories of AWS:  
Flexible Work Schedules (FWS) or Compressed Work Schedules (CWS). 

B.  Alternate Worksite/Location (AWL): A location where official duties are performed away 
from the traditional worksite. An alternate worksite may be the employee's residence, a 
satellite office, or another approved location. For an employee covered by a telework 
agreement, the alternate worksite may be the employee’s official worksite. 

C.  Compressed Work Schedule (CWS):  A schedule in which the biweekly 80-hour 

requirement for a full-time employee is fulfilled in less than 10 workdays. For a part-time 
employee, the biweekly requirement of LESS than 80 hours is completed in less than 10 
workdays. 

D.  Continuity Facility: Locations other than the primary facility used to carry out essential 
functions during continuity of operations events. In some cases, an employee’s home or 
other virtual office options may be designated as a continuity facility if determined to have 
an acceptable risk level for the execution of essential functions continue. 

E.  Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP): A plan containing procedures designed to ensure 

continuity of essential functions at FEMA under all emergency circumstances. Some of the 
major purposes of a COOP Plan include delineating essential Agency functions, 
specifying the order of succession of Agency leaders and delegations of authority, and 
providing for safekeeping of vital records/databases. Under a COOP, employees with 
and without Telework Agreements may be required to work at an alternate worksite. 
F.  Emergency: Includes national and local security situations, extended emergencies, or other 
unique situations when the Agency is closed or access to an employee’s official duty station 
or other agency facilities is limited. 

G.  Emergency Employees:  Employees who are assigned to positions required to sustain a 

facility or function in the event of a localized situation, such as inclement weather, 
interruption of power, or a dismissal or closure of DHS operations or services.  These 
employees are expected to work even when DHS applies dismissal or closure 
procedures.  The designation of Emergency Employees may vary according to the 
particular nature of an exigency.  Emergency Employees may also be designated 
Mission Critical in Agency COOP plans.  See Para. 1-5.H.  FEMA employees have 
regular and recurring emergency management responsibilities; though not every position 
requires routine deployment to disaster sites, all positions may be subject to recall based 
on mission needs. 

H.  Emergency Relocation Group (ERG): Staff assigned responsibility to continue essential 

7 

 
 
functions from an alternate site in the event that their primary operating facilities are 
threatened or have been incapacitated by an incident. 

I.  Executive Level Managers: Associate Administrators, Regional Administrators, Assistant 

Administrators, and Program Directors and other Office Chiefs. 

J.  FEMA Telework Managing Officer: The senior FEMA employee who serves as the Agency’s 

point of contact to provide overall strategic direction on telework issues. 

K.  FEMA Telework Program Manager: The Program Manager serves as the Agency point of 
contact (POC) for Program Office/Regional Telework Coordinators, for senior managers, 
and for external organizations (e.g., the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the General 
Services Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security). He/she provides 
leadership, guidance and interpretation, data analysis, training, and evaluation of the 
Agency’s telework program and policy.  

L.  Flexible Work Schedule (FWS):  A schedule in which an employee selects arrival and 

departure times that are outside business hours of, the FEMA activity to which assigned 
but within the flexible time band, and includes 8 hours of duty and a 30-minute lunch 
period each day. 

M.  Mission Essential Functions (MEFs): The limited set of department and agency level 
government functions that must be continued throughout, or resumed rapidly after, a 
disruption of normal activities. 

N.  Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs): Those department and agency Mission 

Essential Functions, validated by the NCC, which must be performed in order to support the 
performance of MEFs before, during, and in the aftermath of an emergency. PMEFs need to 
be continuous or resumed within 12 hours after an event and maintained for up to 30 days 
or until normal operations can be resumed. 

O.  Official Discipline (Formal): An action pertaining to the reprimand, suspension, or removal 
of an employee which is documented and is present in an employee’s electronic Official 
Personnel File (eOPF).  

P.  Official Duty Station: The official worksite is the location of an employee’s position of 
record where the employee regularly performs his/her duties. Certain location-based pay 
entitlements (such as locality payments, special rate supplements, and non-foreign area 
cost-of-living allowances) are based on the location of the employee's official worksite 
associated with the employee's position of record (See Section 3-3, Official Duty Station).  
If the employee's work involves recurring travel or the employee's work location varies on 
a recurring basis (sometimes referred to as “mobile work”), the official worksite is the 
location where the work activities of the employee's position of record are based, as 
determined by the employing agency, subject to the requirement that the official worksite 
must be in a locality pay area in which the employee regularly performs work.  Examples 
of mobile work include site audits, site inspections, investigations, property management, 
and work performed while commuting, traveling between worksites, or on Temporary Duty 
(TDY). 

Q.  Official Home of Record: The employee’s residential address that is officially listed in the 

employee’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF). 

8 

 
 
R.  Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Any information about an individual maintained in 
an agency system of records, including, but not limited to, financial transactions, medical 
history, criminal history, employment history, or any other information which can be 
retrieved using a personal identifier, such as name, Social Security Number, date and 
place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, and any other personal 
information which is linked or linkable to an individual. 

S.  Portable Work: Work normally performed at an employee’s official worksite that can be 
performed with equal effectiveness at an Alternative Work Location with respect to quality, 
quantity, timeliness, efficiency, customer service, and other aspects of the Agency’s 
mission accomplishment.  This work is part of the employee’s regular assignments and 
does not involve a change in duties or in the way assignments are performed. 

O.  Program Office/Regional Telework Coordinators: FEMA employees who, as part of their 
official duties, serve as points of contact for providing guidance to employees and 
managers in their respective organizations, collect telework data for reports, and oversee 
implementation of the Agency’s Telework Program in their organizations.  In addition, 
they will ensure compliance of the Telework Program with appropriate DHS directives, 
FEMA policies, processes, and procedures, and to identify and implement Telework 
improvements or corrective actions. They work collaboratively with the Agency’s 
Telework Coordinator. 

P.  Re-certification of Telework Agreements: Annual review of an employee’s Telework 

Agreement by the employee’s supervisor to determine the employee’s current eligibility for 
participating in the Telework Program. The employee’s participation in the Telework 
Program may be amended or disapproved (terminated); otherwise agreements remain in 
force. Supervisors must document any amendment in writing by completing a new  
FEMA Form 123-9-0-1, Telework Application and Agreement with the employee.  

Q.  Regular Telework (Core): Work that is performed on an established work schedule at an 
approved AWL on a regular, recurring, and ongoing basis. Telework arrangements may be 
determined by the Supervisor to be full-time or part-time based on eligible telework duties 
and portable work needs (full-time arrangements must consider Section 3-3, Official Duty 
Station). Employees with Regular Telework agreements may also apply for Situational 
Telework in order to work on specific projects and/or in response to an emergency. 

R.  Situational Telework (Episodic): Telework that occurs on an occasional, non-routine basis 
and/or during COOP/pandemic health crisis or other emergency situations. Supervisors 
have discretion to establish timeframes for Situational Telework (Episodic) based on 
work-related factors such as work priority, deadlines, etc. When making an approval for a 
situational telework agreement for a medical reason, special project, or accommodation 
request, the agreement must be reviewed and reapproved every 30 days. Telework 
arrangements may be determined by the Supervisor to be full-time or part-time based on 
eligible telework duties and portable work needs (full-time arrangements must consider 
Section 3-3, Official Duty Station). The definition of situational telework includes 
“unscheduled telework” as defined separately. Situational telework may be used: 

9 

 
 
1.  To allow an employee to perform work on a specific organizational project or a 

discrete portion of a project; 

2.  To permit an employee to perform work at an AWL during inclement weather; 

3.  To allow an employee to perform work when his/her official worksite is not accessible 
(e.g., building damage/emergency, or because of traffic disruption due to street closures, 
conventions, demonstrations, etc.); 

4.  To enable an employee to perform work at an AWL during an agency closure or early 

dismissal (see Section 3-9, Emergency Situations for further detail); or 

5.  For an employee who is recovering from illness or an injury and is temporarily unable to 

physically report to the traditional office, as supported by documentation from the 
employee’s physician. 

S.  Telework:  A  flexible  work  arrangement  under  which  employees  perform  the  duties  and 
responsibilities of their positions from an approved worksite other than the location from 
which the employee would otherwise work. 

T.  Telework Application and Agreement: A written agreement of the terms and conditions of 
the telework arrangement that is completed and signed by the participating employee and 
the supervisor or designee(s).  

U.  Telework-Ready Employee: An employee who meets the eligibility criteria of the 

Telework Program, has completed the required training, has the appropriate space and 
equipment and work assignments needed to work at a location other than the official 
worksite, and has an approved Telework Agreement. 

V.  Tour of Duty: The hours of a day (a daily tour of duty) and the days of an administrative 
workweek (a weekly tour of duty) that constitute an employee's regularly scheduled 
administrative workweek. 

W. Traditional Worksite: The location (i.e., workplace) where an employee would usually 

report for work absent a telework agreement. 

X.  Unscheduled Telework: A term applied in the context of OPM’s Washington, DC, Area 
Dismissal and Closure Procedures, in reference to telework that occurs on day(s) that a 
telework approved employee was not scheduled in advance to telework.  This is 
considered a type of situational telework and applies to all FEMA locations. 

Y.  Workspace Sharing (Hoteling): An arrangement involving two or more employees 
sharing one office/cubicle by coordinating the days each employee is on-site at the 
traditional worksite; or a shared use of non-dedicated workstations by employees (who 
telework the majority of their time) when they are on-site at the traditional worksite.

CHAPTER 2: PROCEDURES 

2-1. Telework Arrangements 

A. While participation in telework is not an employee entitlement, FEMA assumes that all 

positions are eligible for telework unless the supervisor can document otherwise that official 
duties are not suitable for work in a remote or alternate worksite.  An employee may 
participate in the program if the employee meets eligibility requirements as outlined in Section 
2-2, Determining Eligibility. 

B.  A complete telework documentation package must be submitted to the Telework 

Coordinator prior to the participation of an employee in the telework program including: 
1.  A completed and signed FEMA Telework Program Application and Agreement 

Form, which has been prepared in accordance with this policy and attests to the validity 
of eligibility and program participation.  This is required to document any form of telework 
arrangement and prior to the beginning of telework.  Telework plan should be attached; 

2.  The FEMA Telework Health and Safety Checklist must be completed and signed; 
3.  Documentation of completed telework training program as described in Section 2-3, 

Training; and 

4.  Completion of any documentation related to applicable telework equipment. 
C.  A telework arrangement does not alter the terms and conditions of the appointment as 
specified on the employee's Notification of Personnel Action, SF-50. However, an 
employee's official duty station may change if he or she does not regularly commute into 
the agency office (See Section 3-3, Official Duty Station). The telework arrangement must not 
affect other conditions of employment (e.g., hours of work) unless otherwise specified in the 
telework agreement. Employees may be approved both to telework and to work an alternative 
work schedule. 

D. The telework arrangement may normally be terminated in writing by either management or 

by the employee with reasonable advance notice, generally fourteen calendar days, but not 
less than seven calendar days.  Reasons for termination of an arrangement may be a 
decline in performance or productivity, or if the arrangement no longer benefits the 
organization's needs.  Program Offices may establish specific termination provisions, as they 
deem necessary, for their operations and mission needs.  When an arrangement is 
terminated by management, the supervisor must provide the employee with a brief, written 
explanation as to why.    

E.  The  telework  agreement  shall  be  for  the  performance  of  official  duties  or  related  activities 
(professional  development,  training)  and  shall  not  be  treated  as  an  opportunity  to  conduct 
personal business. 

F.  Teleworkers are responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements for the care of 

dependents at home if the home is their official telework duty location. That is, employees may 
not use telework to personally care for a dependent. However, this does not preclude a 
teleworker from having a caregiver working in the home providing care to the 
dependent(s) while he/she teleworks. 

G.  Management reserves the right, normally with one day notice, to require employees to 
return to the official duty location on scheduled telework days, based on operational 
requirements.  Exceptions for a lesser notification may be appropriate in certain unforeseen 
situations. 

H.  Approved telework agreements should be coordinated with the Agency Transit Subsidy 

Manager. Notify the Agency Transit Subsidy Manager of the number of days the employee 
will telework so the transit subsidy coordinator can determine if the employee’s subsidy 
should be reduced appropriately. 

15 

 
 
I.  Employees who telework must be available to their coworkers, supervisor, and customers 
in the same manner as if they were in their duty location. For example, phone calls and 
emails must be answered in the same timeframe as if the employee were working in their 
duty location. This means that phones may normally be forwarded to agency issued 
equipment. It may also mean that the employee should provide a secondary phone number 
to be reached at the telework site if possible. Specific communication expectations shall be 
addressed in the telework agreement, if necessary. 

J.  During emergency situations, such as closures of the employee’s official duty station, or 
during heightened periods of disaster work activity,, the agency may require employees 
with telework agreements to telework on short notice.  See Paragraph 3-9. 

2-2. Determining Eligibility 

A.  Positions eligible for telework are those involving tasks (may be one or more) and work 
activities that are portable, do not depend on the employee being at the official duty 
location worksite, are measureable, and are conducive to supervisory oversight at the 
alternate worksite. Job series and title do not determine eligibility as supervisors and 
managers are required to encourage all eligible employees the opportunity to Telework. 
B.  Tasks and work activities generally suited for telework include, but are not limited to: 

reading, reviewing, editing, scheduling, planning, writing, and policy development; research; 
analysis (e.g., investigating, program analysis, policy analysis, and financial analysis); 
report writing; telephone-intensive tasks (excluding receptionist duties); computer-oriented 
tasks (e.g., required or developmental training, programming, data entry, word processing, 
web page design) and data processing. Tasks and work activities not generally suited for 
telework include, but are not limited to positions that: involve daily handling of classified 
materials; require the use of specialized equipment; require daily contact with other people; 
or where a daily physical presence is required per the official duties of the position. FEMA 
positions that are not typically suited for core telework include: inspectors, fire fighters, 
warehouse staff, and similar positions. However, these positions may still be suitable for 
Situational Telework on a case-by-case basis. The premise is that positions are eligible for 
telework and supervisors must document exceptions. 

C.  An employee suitable for telework is one who has demonstrated personal characteristics 

that are well suited to telework, as determined by the supervisor, including as a minimum: 
1.  Demonstrated dependability and the ability to handle responsibility; 
2.  A proven record of high personal motivation, independence, dependability, good time 
management skills, ability to prioritize work effectively, and ability to work without 
close supervision; 

3.  The ability to prioritize work effectively and utilize good time management skills; 
4.  A proven, or on target for, a minimum current performance rating of at least 

“proficient,” or “achieved expectations” in all performance criteria as designated by 
the FEMA performance management programs;  

5.  The employee must not be on leave restriction; and, 
6.  No adverse personnel actions within any of the following categories: 

A.  A Letter of Reprimand, a suspension without pay, or removal, imposed for 

absence without leave for more than 5 days in a calendar year or for violations of 
Subpart G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Employees of the Executive 
Branch for viewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography, including child 
pornography, on a Federal Government computer or while performing official 
Federal Government duties), to the extent that such action remains in the 
employee’s OPF, precludes approval of telework.   

16 

 
 
 
B.  Imposition of any other disciplinary or adverse action not included in A., above, 

within the previous six months precludes approval of telework. 

C.  Imposition of any other disciplinary or adverse action not included in A. or B., 
above, regardless of age of the action, may preclude approval of telework, in 
the discretion of the supervisor. 

D.  An employee may not be approved for telework for one year from the date of 

commencement of a performance improvement plan (PIP). 

2-3. Training 

A.  The employee must complete the telework awareness training prior to signing an initial 

telework agreement and prior to starting to telework. Training is available at: 
http://www.telework.gov/tools and resources/training/employees/index.aspx 

B.  Supervisors must complete telework awareness training in order to approve a telework 

arrangement. Training is available at: 
http://www.telework.gov/toolsandresources/training/managers/index.aspx 

2-4. Appeals 

An employee denied a request to telework may appeal to the appropriate Executive 
Level Manager.  The appeals process must ensure that the employee and management 
have a fair and equitable opportunity to be heard. Appeal decisions are binding for no 
more than six months unless circumstances change or are agreed upon by both parties 
involved in the appeal. It is FEMA policy that whenever possible, individuals be allowed to 
telework, so the burden in an appeal on why the agency would not allow telework is on the 
supervisor, not on the employee. With respect to employees covered by a collective 
bargaining agreement, appeals will be governed by the negotiated grievance procedure.  
The Telework Coordinator will notify the employee of the appeal decision.

CHAPTER 3: TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TELEWORK PROGRAM 

3-1. Changes to Telework Agreement  

An employee who teleworks may be required to come into the office on their telework 
day when management makes a determination their presence is required. At least a 
one-day notice should be given to the employee, however unforeseen circumstances 
may require less notice. A teleworker who must report to the official duty station 
should do so in a reasonable amount of time. Items to take into consideration are 
traveling distance, mode of transportation, etc. Teleworkers and management should 
discuss these items. In some cases, there may not be sufficient time for the teleworker to 
report to the official duty station. Teleworkers who wish to change their scheduled 
telework day permanently should complete another agreement and obtain the proper 
approvals. Intermittent changes in a telework agreement do not require a change in the 
agreement; however teleworkers should make the request at least one day in 
advance. 

3-2. Residential Telework Environment  

A.  It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure that all the requirements to do official 

work at their residence are met in an environment that allows the tasks to be 
performed safely (See attached FEMA Form 123-9-0-2, Employee Self-Certification 
Safety and Health Checklist). 

B.  The employee must designate an area in the home as their official work area. The 
area designated must be documented on the telework agreement. The employee 
should check with their community associations, if one exists, to ensure there is not a 
restriction on working from home. 

C.  Each teleworker must understand that telework is not a substitute for dependent 

care. A caregiver, however, may be present in the home to take care of a dependent 
(e.g., infant, non-school age child and/or an elder) while the teleworker is performing 
their official duties. Children who require no supervision may be present at the alternate 
worksite. Management may request documentation from the teleworker to 
substantiate a caregiver is providing on-site or off-site care during the teleworker's 
scheduled work. 

D.  The Government is not responsible for any operating costs in the Residential 

Telework Environment that are associated with the employee's use of his or her 
personal residence as an alternate worksite. This includes home maintenance, 
insurance, or utilities. 

E.  The employee agrees to permit access to their home by agency representatives 

when necessary to ensure proper maintenance of agency-owned 
equipment.  Teleworkers should be given at least one day’s advance notice of any 
such visit. Visits should only be done during regular working hours.  

3-3. Official Duty Station  

A.  All pay, leave, and travel entitlements must be based on the employee's official 
duty station. The employee's official duty station for such purposes as special 
salary rates, locality pay adjustments, and travel is the city or town, county, and 
state in which the employee normally performs their official duties. Supervisors must 
consult with OCCHCO if there are any changes that warrant a change in the official 
duty station. 

B.  An employee's official duty station must be documented on the employee's Notification 
of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent). (See "Duty Station" blocks 

18 

 
 
 
38  and  39  of  the  Standard  Form  50  showing  the  city/county  and  state  in  which  the 
official worksite is located.) 

C.  An employee's official duty station would not change as long as the employee 

regularly commutes into the agency office at least twice each biweekly pay period on a 
regular and recurring basis. 

D.  If the employee does not regularly commute into the agency office at least twice 
each biweekly pay period, the official duty station must be changed to the alternate 
worksite. The official duty station would not generally be changed for employees who 
telework for medical reasons and/or in emergency situations (i.e. COOP, agency 
closures, urgent deadlines, etc.) as these types of telework arrangements are not 
intended as permanent, but on a temporary basis not to exceed six months. 

E.  When an employee’s official worksite/duty station is reassigned from the traditional 

worksite to the alternate worksite, the affected employee and his/her supervisor should 
discuss the implications of the reassignment, to include: 

1.  Certain location-based pay entitlements (e.g., locality pay, special 
rate supplements, and non-foreign cost of living allowances, etc.) are 
based on the location of the employee’s official worksite/duty station. 
2.  Reimbursement for official business travel is based on the location of the 

employee’s official worksite/duty station. For example, when an employee 
whose alternate worksite is outside the commuting area of the traditional 
worksite is required to travel to the traditional worksite, the location of the 
employee’s official worksite/duty station will determine whether the employee 
or the Component pays for the required travel. 

3.  Generally, the official worksite/duty station is used to identify the competitive 

area during reduction-in-force determinations. 

3-4. Time and Attendance, Work and Performance, and Overtime  

A.  Time spent in a telework status must be accounted for and reported in the same 

manner as if the employee reported for duty at the official duty station. The 
employee is required to satisfactorily complete all assigned work, consistent with the 
approach adopted for all other employees in the work group, and according to 
standards and guidelines in the employee's performance plan. 

B.  The employee agrees to follow their normal mission area/agency/staff office 

procedures regarding the requesting and approval of overtime, credit hours, and 
leave that are worked while in a telework status. 

C.  All approved telework hours are to be reported in the WebTA Time Attendance 
and System. Employees should code use WebTA transaction code 01- Telework 
Home <=2 days if equal to or less than two days per work week and transaction 
code 01-Telework Home >2 days for three or more days per work week. 

3-5. Reimbursable Expenses  

The FEMA Office of the Chief Financial Officer will set policy for determining any 
applicable reimbursable expenses for eligible telework employees. 

19 

 
 
 
 
3-6. Security, Supplies, and Equipment  

A.  Classified documents (hard copy or electronic) and/or equipment (e.g., diskettes, 
computers, laptops, removable hard drives, and other media used for processing 
classified information) must not  be taken to an employee's alternate worksite. For 
core telework, FOUO Information may be accessed using employee-owned 
equipment but may only be saved on government-issued equipment. 

B.  All teleworkers are responsible for the security of all official data, and the protection 

of government-issued equipment/property while carrying out the mission of 
FEMA. Government-issued equipment must only be used for official duties and 
only by the teleworker. A FEMA approved remote access solution must be used 
(such as a virtual private network or Citrix solution). Authorization to telework is 
contingent upon the availability of equipment and connectivity at the alternate 
worksite sufficient to permit the employee reliable and secure access to email, 
telephone, and any other systems necessary to perform the duties of his or her 
position efficiently and without any detriment to mission accomplishment. The 
employee is responsible for the installation, repair, and maintenance of their own 
personal equipment in coordination with CIO guidance. 

C. 

If needed, the Agency will provide necessary office supplies (paper, pens, 
compact disc , etc.). Employees should obtain these items from the official duty 
station supply room or through the regular procedure at their official duty station. 
The Agency will not reimburse employees for any supplies purchased 
independently, nor will the Agency provide office furniture except as a reasonable 
accommodation. 

D.  The agency is responsible for obtaining software licenses that are necessary to give 
the teleworker access on their personal equipment to perform their official duties. 
When the telework arrangement ends, the teleworker is responsible for removing 
and returning all government-owned software to the agency Software Manager or 
agency Chief Information Officer. The responsibilities for configuration 
management, patch and antivirus management, and other administrative 
requirements must be defined in this agreement to include the expectations of the 
teleworker in these matters. The agency is responsible for the maintenance of all 
Government-issued equipment. The teleworker may be required to bring such 
equipment into the office for maintenance. The employee must return all 
Government-issued equipment and material to the agency at the conclusion of the 
telework arrangement or at the agency's request. 

E.  FOUO Information must be transported from the official duty station to the 

alternate worksite in a secure container (e.g., briefcase with lock). Sensitive But 
Unclassified Information, including SSI, Privacy Act, and "For Official Use Only" 
data and non-sensitive, unclassified data must be stored in a secure file cabinet at 
the alternate worksite. When such information is displayed on a computer screen, it 
must not be visible to others. Computer privacy screens which block computer 
screen visibility to others must be used when SSI is displayed on a computer 
monitor at an alternate worksite. Neither family members nor other individuals 
are authorized to handle and/or view any government Sensitive But Unclassified 
Information, including SSI, Privacy Act, and "For Official Use Only" data. 

20 

 
 
 
3-7.   Worker’s Compensation and Other Liabilities  

Employees are covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act at the alternate 
worksite as long as the injury occurred while performing their official duties and in the 
designated work area identified on the telework agreement. If an injury occurs, the 
employee must notify the supervisor immediately, provide details of the accident or 
injury, and complete Department of Labor Form CA-1, Federal Employee's Notice of 
Traumatic Injury and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation. The government is not 
liable for damages to the employee's personal or real property while the employee is 
teleworking, except to the extent the government is held liable under the Federal Tort 
Claims Act or the Military and Civilian Employees Claims Act. 

3-8.   Standards of Conduct  

The employee acknowledges that he/she continues to be bound by the Standards of 
Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch while teleworking and using 
government-issued equipment. 

3-9.   Emergency Telework.  

A.  Supervisors  and  managers  shall  classify  their  employees  as  emergency  and  non-
emergency  employees  promptly  and  appropriately,  and  shall  maximize  telework 
readiness among their employees in a manner consistent with this policy. 

B.  OPM Announcements.  Employees shall monitor, read and comply with OPM 

announcements unless otherwise directed by the Agency or their supervisors.  To 
the extent that OPM announcements conflict with FEMA and supervisory guidance, 
employees must follow FEMA and supervisory guidance.   

C.  When OPM announces that Federal agencies in the Washington, DC, area are 

open and that employees have the options of unscheduled leave or unscheduled 
telework, the following procedures apply: 

1.  Emergency Employees must report for duty as directed unless they are telework 

ready and permitted to telework by their supervisors. 

2.  Non-Emergency Employees shall notify their supervisors in advance if they 

intend to take unscheduled leave. 

3.  Non-Emergency Telework Ready Employees.  The Agency may direct non-

emergency, telework ready employees to perform unscheduled telework.  If not 
directed to telework, they must report to work, take unscheduled leave or request 
their supervisor’s permission to telework. 

D.  When OPM announces that Federal agencies in the Washington, DC, area are 

closed, or when FEMA closes an employee’s official duty station, non-emergency 
employees (including employees on pre-approved paid leave) will be granted 
excused absence (administrative leave) for the number of hours they were 
scheduled to work unless they are covered by one of the following categories: 

1.  Emergency Employees must report for duty as directed unless they are telework 

ready and permitted to telework by their supervisors. 

2.  Non-Emergency,Telework Ready Employees who are already scheduled to 

telework or who are directed to perform unscheduled telework must telework the 
entire work day.  If directed to telework, such employees may request the use of 
(1) earned annual leave, compensatory time off, credit hours, or sick leave, as 

21 

 
 
appropriate; (2) leave without pay; (3) their flexible work schedule day off or 
revision of their work hours under flexible work schedules.  On a case-by-case 
basis, FEMA supervisors may excuse a telework ready employee from duty as 
outlined in ¶ 3-9 F.   

4.  The status of employees on Leave Without Pay, official travel, or an alternate 

work schedule day off is not affected by any such announcement. 

E.  COOP Activation.  The Agency may require any employee to telework in accordance 

with an activated COOP plan.  

F.  Excusal.  Supervisors may excuse telework ready employees from work and grant 
annual or administrative leave with pay, as appropriate, when an emergency 
adversely affects the telework site (e.g., disruption of electricity, loss of heat, loss of 
connectivity, etc.), or if the teleworker faces a personal hardship that prevents him or 
her from teleworking effectively.  Dependent care needs do not ordinarily entitle a 
teleworker to administrative leave; annual leave will be granted as appropriate. 

3-10.  Telework and COOP Planning.  All organizations must incorporate telework into their 

continuity plans and procedures by: 

A.  Assessing the organization’s essential functions to identify which functions the 
organization can conduct via telework, including evaluating the use of telework for 
supporting extended continuity operations and use by non-emergency response 
group (ERG) personnel; 

B.  Establishing and maintaining plans and procedures to use telework as a primary or 
backup continuity strategy for those essential functions and supporting tasks that are 
telework authorized, based upon the assessment; 

C.  Assessing  the  capability  of  situational  telework  agreements  for  both  ERG  and  non-
ERG  personnel,  to  ensure  that  employees  may  be  authorized  to  telework  during  a 
continuity event; 

D.  Establishing situational telework agreements for all employees to determine their 

eligibility to telework during a continuity activation; 

E.  Ensuring that each eligible employee is authorized to telework during a continuity 
activation by successfully completing the required telework training program (as 
described in Section 2-3, Training) and completing necessary documentation (as 
described in Section 2-1, Telework Arrangements, Part B); and 

F.  Coordinating with FEMA’s designated Telework Managing Officer when developing 

and integrating the organization’s continuity plan.

CHAPTER 2 - ACTIONS COVERED 

2-1.  Competitive Actions  

The competitive procedures established by this Manual apply to the following 
placement actions:  

A.  Time-limited promotions for more than 120 days to a higher-graded position. 
(Note: Prior service during the preceding 12 months under noncompetitive 
time-limited promotions and noncompetitive details to higher graded positions 
count toward the 120-day total.)  

1.  A temporary promotion may be made permanent without further 

competition provided the temporary promotion was originally made under 
competitive procedures and that it might lead to a permanent promotion 
was made known to all candidates.  

2.  The Agency must give the employee advance written notice of the 

conditions under which the time-limited promotion is given, including the 
time limit of the promotion; the requirement for competition beyond 120 
days; and that the employee may be returned at any time to the position 
from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent 
grade and pay, when the return is not subject to the procedures in 5 
C.F.R., Part 351, Reduction in Force; Part 432, Performance Based 
Reduction in Grade and Removal Actions; Part 752, Adverse Actions; and 
Part 771, Agency Administrative Grievance System.  

3.  A temporarily promoted employee may not be reassigned to a position 
with a higher grade or with promotion potential higher than his or her 
permanent position without the use of competitive procedures. A formal 
personnel action must be used to document all temporary promotions, 
including their termination.  

4.  Employees who are temporarily promoted must meet all requirements of a 

permanent promotion, including time-in-grade and the Qualifications 
Standards for General Schedule Positions or Job Qualifications System 
for Trades and Labor Occupations System qualification requirements of 
the new position. 

B.  Details for more than 120 days to a higher graded position or to a position 

with higher promotion potential. (Note: Prior service during the preceding 12 
months under noncompetitive detail to higher graded positions and 
noncompetitive time-limited promotions count toward the 120-day total.)   

C.  Selection for training that is part of an authorized training agreement, part of a 
promotion program, or required before an employee may be considered for a 
promotion. 

D.  Reassignment or Change to Lower Grade to a position with more promotion 

potential than a position previously held on a permanent basis in the 
competitive service (except as permitted by reduction-in-force regulations). 

10 

 
 
E.  Transfer to a position at a higher grade or with more promotion potential than 
a position previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service. 

F.  Reinstatement to a permanent or temporary position at a higher grade or with 
more promotion potential than a position previously held on a permanent 
basis in the competitive service.  

G.  Promotion, demotion or reassignment of an employee serving under an 

indefinite appointment in a competitive position, except that this authority may 
not be used to move an employee:  

1.  From a position in which an initial overseas limited appointment is 

authorized to another position; or  

2.  To a position in which an initial overseas limited appointment is authorized 

from another position. 

2-2.  Exceptions 

The following actions are exceptions to competitive procedures outlined in this 
Manual.  

A.  A promotion resulting from the upgrading of a position without significant 
change in the duties and responsibilities due to the issuance of a new 
classification standard or the correction of an initial classification error. 

B.  A position change permitted by reduction-in-force procedures. 

C.  A promotion without current competition of an employee who was appointed 
in the competitive service from a civil service register, by direct hire, by 
noncompetitive appointment or noncompetitive conversion, or under 
competitive promotion procedures for an assignment intended to prepare the 
employee for the position being filled. (This is a career ladder promotion, the 
intent of which must be made a matter of record and documented in the 
promotion plan, and which requires the employee’s current rating of record be 
“proficient” or higher.) 

D.  A promotion resulting from an employee’s position being classified at a higher 

grade based on accretion of duties and responsibilities.  

E.  A temporary promotion, or detail to a higher graded position or to a position 

with known promotion potential of 120 days or less. 

F.  Promotion to a grade previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive 
service from which the employee was separated or demoted for reasons 
other than performance or conduct.  

G.  Promotion, reassignment, demotion, transfer, reinstatement, or detail to a 

position having promotion potential no greater than the potential of a position 
an employee currently holds or previously held on a permanent basis in the 
competitive service and did not lose because of performance or conduct 
reasons. 

11 

 
 
 
H.  Consideration of a candidate not given proper consideration in a competitive 

promotion action.  

I.  Appointments of career Senior Executive Service appointees with competitive 
service reinstatement eligibility to any position for which they qualify in the 
competitive service at any grade or salary level, including Senior-Level 
positions established under 5 C.F.R., Part 319—Employment in Senior-Level 
and Scientific and Professional positions. 

2-3.  Priority Placement 

Before taking any action to fill a vacancy, either competitively or 
noncompetitively, the HR Specialist, in conjunction with the selecting official, is 
responsible for ensuring the requirements pertaining to priority consideration are 
adhered to. Priority placement programs include the following: 

Career Transition Assistance Program (CTAP) – When filling vacancies from 
within DHS, the HR Specialist and selecting official, will ensure consideration is 
first given to well-qualified CTAP eligibles in the local commuting area. A well-
qualified CTAP eligible within the local commuting area must be selected before 
selecting any other candidate from within or outside DHS. 

Department of Homeland Security Priority Placement Program (DPPP) – When 
seeking candidates outside FEMA’s workforce for vacant positions, priority 
placement will be given to FEMA employees whose positions were downgraded 
and are entitled to grade retention. In rare instances, an individual exception may 
be granted. 

Interagency Career Transition Assistance Program (ICTAP) - When filling 
vacancies from outside DHS workforce, the HR Specialist and selecting official 
will ensure priority consideration is given to well-qualified ICTAP eligibles in the 
local commuting area. Selection priority will be applied unless the personnel 
action to be taken is an exception to ICTAP, as defined in 5 C.F.R. § 330.707. 

Reemployment Priority List (RPL) – When filling vacancies from outside DHS 
workforce, hiring preference will be given to eligible RPL registrants in the local 
commuting area who are deemed qualified for the position. When a qualified RPL 
registrant is available, the position may not be filled by a new appointment unless 
the individual appointed is a 10-point veteran, by transfer (outside of DHS), or by 
reemployment unless the individual is a preference eligible or is exercising 
restoration or reemployment rights.  

12 

 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 3 - AREA OF CONSIDERATION 

3-1.  Methods for Filling Vacancies 

Vacancies may be filled by any appropriate method including special placement 
programs, new appointment, reassignment, transfer, reinstatement, promotion, 
etc. 

3-2.  Area of Consideration 

The area of consideration should be sufficiently broad to ensure a reasonable 
number of highly qualified candidates for the position to be filled. Area of 
consideration determinations must be made prior to announcing the position(s), 
documented in the merit promotion file, and clearly specified in the vacancy 
announcement.  

A.  For positions at GS-13 and above, the minimum area of consideration will be 

FEMA nationwide.  

B.  For positions at GS-12 and below, the minimum area of consideration will be 

the duty station in which the position is located.  

C.  Exceptions that reduce the area of consideration must be approved in writing 

by the Chief Component Human Capital Officer.   

3-3.  Methods of Locating Candidates 

In its search for qualified applicants, the selecting official and OCCHCO should 
determine which source or sources to use, based on the Agency’s mission, 
objectives, and its Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program. The Agency 
may use any of the following options:  

A.  Announce the vacancy to FEMA status candidates only.  

B.  Announce the vacancy to FEMA employees and other status eligibles as 

determined in OPM regulations. 

C.  In addition to the merit promotion process, request certification of eligibles 

from OPM or FEMA’s Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) in addition to items A 
and/or B above.  

D.  Consider other appropriate sources, such as reinstatement, transfer, persons 

with disabilities, or Veterans Recruitment Appointment eligibles, etc. 

13 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 4 - INITIATING RECRUITMENT 

4-1.  Job Analysis 

Prior to initiating a recruitment action, the selecting official or his/her designated 
subject matter expert, in conjunction with the HR Specialist, will conduct a job 
analysis. The job analysis will identify the basic duties and responsibilities of the 
position, knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or competencies required to perform 
those duties and responsibilities, and the importance of each knowledge, skill, 
ability, or competency. The use of any selective placement factors will be 
documented in the job analysis to show the relevancy or the specific proficiency 
or factor as being essential for successful performance of the job. 

The job analysis must be approved by the selecting official or subject matter 
expert and the HR Specialist prior to issuance of the vacancy announcement.  

4-2.  Occupational Questionnaire 

The selecting official or subject matter expert, in conjunction with the HR 
Specialist, will develop questions for each knowledge, skill, ability, or competency 
identified in the job analysis. The HR Specialist will ensure that the questions 
make clear distinctions between creditable levels of qualifications and contain 
appropriate measures.  

The scoring of the occupational questionnaire will be based on the importance of 
each knowledge, skill, ability and competency, as identified by the selecting 
official or subject matter expert in the job analysis. The assessment 
questionnaire scoring will be clearly documented for each merit promotion action. 

The occupational questionnaire and associated scoring must be approved by the 
selecting official or subject matter expert and the HR Specialist prior to issuance 
of the vacancy announcement.  

4-3.  Recruitment package 

To initiate a vacancy, the selecting official will submit a recruitment package to 
OCCHCO. Failure to submit a complete recruitment package will result in the HR 
Specialist returning the package to the Program Office. The following documents 
are required in the recruitment package: 

A.  SF-52, Request for Personnel Action, with the necessary approvals within the 

Program Office and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer; 

B.  Classified position description(s); 

C.  Job analysis, including justification for a selective placement factor (if 

applicable); and 

D.  Occupational questionnaire. 

14

3.  Veterans Employment Opportunities Act and/or Veterans Recruitment Act 

eligibles – Member copy 4 of the DD-214 (Certificate of Release or 
Discharge from Active Duty) and/or documentation of service-connected

considered as a Schedule A eligible and therefore will not receive 
consideration as a non-competitive eligible. 

5.  Other non-competitive eligibles (e.g., Peace Corps volunteers) – 

Documentation reflecting non-competitive eligibility must be submitted. 
Applicants who do not provide this documentation by the closing date will

At any point in the application process, the applicant may be required to submit 
additional documentation including a current performance appraisal and 
references. 

6-3.  Requirements for Employees on Extended Absences 

Supervisors and managers will ensure that employees within the area of 
consideration who are absent from their positions for legitimate reasons (e.g. 
compensable injury, Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments, military 
service, etc.) receive appropriate consideration for positions for which they have 
indicated in writing before departure that they wish to receive consideration. The 
employee is responsible for informing his/her supervisor or manager of those job 
opportunities for which he/she wishes to be considered during periods of 
absence, and for providing his/her supervisor or manager with contact 
information (i.e., email address, phone number, fax number). The supervisor or 
manager will be responsible for contacting the employee to provide vacancy 
information.  

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 7 - EVALUATION AND REFERRAL OF CANDIDATES 

7-1.  Evaluation 

Upon the vacancy announcement closing, completed application packages will 
be reviewed to ensure they meet the necessary eligibility and qualification 
requirements. All eligibility and qualification determinations will be fully 
documented in the case file. For technical positions, the HR Specialist may 
request the assistance of a subject matter expert in the review of applications for 
qualification requirements. The subject matter expert, who assists in the review 
of applications, must be at the equivalent or higher grade level than the full 
performance level of the position being filled and may not be the supervisor 
and/or selecting official of the position to be reviewed and filled. 

A.  Eligibility 

All candidates must satisfy all legal and regulatory requirements, including 
time-in-grade and time-after-competitive appointment, within 30 days of the 
closing date of the announcement. In addition, candidates must have 
submitted the necessary supporting documentation in order to receive 
consideration (e.g., CTAP/ICTAP eligibility).   

B.  Qualifications 

Candidates must meet the minimum qualification requirements as prescribed 
by OPM, as well as any selective factors (if applicable), within 30 days of the 
closing date of the announcement in order to receive consideration. 
Candidates will be evaluated solely on submitted application materials. 

7-2.  Referral 

A certificate will be issued for each grade level for which the position was 
advertised and qualified candidates exist.  

A.  Merit Promotion Certificate 

Merit promotion candidates are eligible to be considered either competitively 
or non-competitively based on the requirements outlined in Chapter 2 of this 
manual. Candidates eligible for consideration competitively are placed on the 
merit promotion certificate. Candidates eligible for consideration non-
competitively are placed on the non-competitive certificate. Competitive 
candidates eligible for consideration under a special hiring authority (i.e., 30 
percent or more disabled veterans, Schedule A – appointment of individuals 
with disabilities, Peace Corps volunteers, Veterans Recruitment Appointment, 
etc.) can also be placed on a non-competitive certificate. 

Up to fifteen candidates, with a rating of 85.00 or above and who are solely 
eligible to be considered competitively, will be referred on a Merit Promotion 
certificate for any one vacant position. Two additional candidates will be 
referred for each additional vacancy. Candidates will be referred in 
alphabetical order by last name.  

19 

 
 
 
In cases where there are more than fifteen candidates and tied ratings are 
present, a tie-breaker will be used to determine the fifteen best qualified 
candidates. Any of the following tie breaking methods may be used. 
Regardless which procedure(s) is/are utilized, the case file will be 
documented for reconstruction purposes.  

1.  Name Request: The selecting official may submit a name request within 

the tied range. 

2.  Random Number: Ties are broken randomly using the last digit of 

eligibles’ social security numbers in conjunction with random numbers. 

B.  Non-Competitive Certificate: All qualified candidates that are eligible to be 
considered non-competitively (i.e., laterals/reassignments, non-competitive 
reinstatements, or transfers) and those eligible for consideration under a 
special hiring authority (e.g., 30 percent or more disabled veterans, Schedule 
A – appointment of individuals with disabilities, Peace Corps volunteers, etc.) 
will be separately referred in alphabetical order by last name on a Non-
Competitive referral list.  

All qualified candidates eligible for consideration under the Veterans 
Recruitment Appointment hiring authority will be referred in veterans 
preference order on a separate non-competitive referral list.  

7-3.  Certificate Expiration 

Certificates will be valid for 15 days from the date of issuance. The 15 day period 
may be extended at the determination of the OCCHCO; however, the certificate 
may not exceed the certificates’ validity period of three months from the date of 
issuance. An extension request must be submitted in writing to the HR Specialist. 
The CCHCO or designee will notify the Program Office in writing of the decision 
to grant or deny the extension request. 

7-4.  Re-Use of Selection Certificate 

A selecting official may make additional selection(s) following the initial date of 
selection provided that: 

A.  The selection certificate has not expired; 

B.  The position is the same title, series, grade, and geographic location; 

C.  The qualification requirements for the additional selection(s) are the same as 

the position originally announced; and 

D.  The initial vacancy announcement stated that multiple selections may be 

made. 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 8 - SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION TO CANDIDATES 

8-1.  Review of Candidates 

The selecting official will review application packages submitted by each of the 
referred candidates and uniformly consider each candidate using job-related 
criteria appropriate to the position being filled and consistent with merit system 
principles. 

Due weight will be given to performance appraisals and incentive awards 
documented in application packages during the evaluation/rating review and/or at 
the time of final selection consideration. Appraisals and awards should be 
considered additional sources of information and used as an indicator of the 
quality of prior experience and should only be given consideration to the extent 
that the information is relevant to the requirements of the position being filled. 
Consideration of appraisals should only be given to the content of the appraisal, 
not to the performance appraisal system. The mere possession of a specific 
number of appraisal levels or awards amounts are not factors used in the 
evaluation process and should not be used to mechanically increase ratings. 

8-2. 

Interviews 

The selecting official will determine which candidates to interview and will 
designate individuals to participate in the interview process. Interview panels will 
be used for all positions and should be diverse to the greatest extent possible. 
Panels will consist of three employees at an equivalent or higher grade level than 
the full performance level of the position being filled who are not supervised by 
the position.  

Selecting officials in the hiring office are responsible for retaining documentation 
of interviews and discussions that pertain to selection or non-selection of 
candidates. This documentation should be sufficient to allow the decisions made 
and actions taken to be reconstructed if necessary. This documentation must be 
kept for a minimum of 2 years, or until the original case file in the OCCHCO has 
been reviewed and destroyed.  

8-3.  Reference Checks 

Selecting officials will conduct reference checks prior to making a final selection. 
Reference checks should be conducted with current and former supervisors. 

8-4.  Selection Decisions 

Selecting officials will annotate their selectee, and alternate selections (including 
order of selection) on the certificate. Should no selections be made, the selecting 
official will provide a written explanation. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8-5.  Release of Candidates 

The official request for the release of an employee selected through merit 
promotion procedures will be made only by the HR Specialist. Normally, 
employees selected will be released from their current position within 2 weeks of 
the date the candidate is notified of his/her selection or at the end of the first full 
pay period after a release date has been officially requested. However, under 
extenuating circumstances, managers may request to extend a release date for 
up to 30 days. If the selection involves an immediate promotion, the promotion 
should occur within 2 weeks of the date the candidate is notified of his/her 
selection or at the beginning of the first full pay period after the selection is made. 
Any decision regarding the establishment of a release date should take into 
consideration employee concerns, workload requirements, and agency mission 
objectives. 

8-6.  Notification to Candidates 

The HR Specialist will notify all candidates of receipt of their application, eligibility 
and qualifications determination, certification referral, and final status of their 
application. The HR Specialist will make the official job offer to the Selectee. 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 9 - COMPLAINTS AND RECONSIDERATION 

9-1.  Complaints 

Employees have the right to file a complaint relating to a promotion action. The 
standards for adjudicating complaints are set forth in 5 C.F.R., Part 300 -
Employment (General). Such complaints shall be resolved under the appropriate 
procedures:  

A.  If the complaint involves a matter covered by a specific provision of a 

negotiated agreement with a recognized employee union and the employee is 
a member of the bargaining unit, the grievance or complaint must be filed 
under negotiated procedures. If the complaint involves a candidate who is not 
in a bargaining unit, the grievance must be filed under the administrative 
grievance policy. Non-selection from among a group of properly ranked and 
certified candidates is not an appropriate basis for a grievance.  

B.  Applicants who feel they have been discriminated against because of their 
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical/mental disability, 
genetic information, or retaliation for prior EEO activity may file a complaint 
under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.103(a), use the negotiated grievance procedures if 
they are included in the bargaining unit, or use the administrative grievance 
procedure if they are not. 

9-2.  Reconsideration  

Applicants who wish to request a reconsideration of rating must submit a request 
in writing to the OCCHCO indicating why the original decision was not 
appropriate.  

The OCCHCO will conduct a review of the application package to determine 
whether the candidate received proper consideration for the vacancy. The 
OCCHCO will respond in writing with the reasons for the decision, without unduly 
compromising the rating schedule.  

If the reconsideration request leads to a rating change, the HR Specialist will take 
immediate steps to correct the error and ensure that the candidate receives the 
proper consideration under the vacancy. 

If a selection has already been made, priority consideration may be appropriate if 
the candidate's name should have been referred to the selecting official, but was 
not. Priority consideration will be given for a period of 6 months for the next 
equivalent vacancy. Equivalent positions will generally be located in the same 
commuting area and have the same title, series, grade, full performance level, 
and mandatory competencies. The HR Specialist will provide the application to 
the selecting official for consideration. The selecting official must consider the 
candidate for the vacant position, but is under no obligation to select the 
candidate.  

23 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 10 - RECORDKEEPING 

10-1.  Recordkeeping 

All merit promotion files will be maintained by the OCCHCO for a minimum of two 
years. Records pertinent to a pending grievance or EEO complaint must be 
retained for a minimum of two years following resolution of the case. At a 
minimum, the following information must be retained in the merit promotion file:  

A.  Vacancy announcement; 

B.  Classified position description for all grade levels;  

C.  Signed job analysis to include justification for selective placement factor, if 

applicable; 

D.  Occupational questionnaire and associated scoring; 

E.  Application packages received from each applicant; 

F.  Names of all candidates and qualification determinations made by HR 

Specialist or SME; 

G.  Names and ratings of all qualified candidates; 

H.  Merit Promotion Certificate and Non-Competitive List of Eligibles with 

annotated selection decisions, signed and dated by the HR Specialist and the 
selecting official; 

I.  Notification to applicants;  

J.  Completed SF-52, Request for Personnel Action with appropriate nature of 

action, legal authority, and remarks; and 

K.  Any other personnel or employment record made or kept having to do with 

the selection and/or promotion, including, but not limited to, any notes taken 
during interviews by any interviewing official. 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 11 - REVIEW AND EVALUATION 

11-1.  Review and Evaluation 

The OCCHCO will conduct a review and evaluation of its operation of the Merit 
Promotion Program at least every three years. The review will include input from 
supervisors, managers and employees. Topics will include, at a minimum:  

A.  Assessment of the effectiveness and usefulness of the promotion plan. 

B.  Review of personnel actions processed during the evaluation period to 
determine that actions were taken in compliance with pertinent laws, 
regulations, and the provisions of this Manual.  

C.  Review of the adequacy and timeliness of the Agency’s response to 

employees’ complaints relative to merit promotion actions and procedures. 

D.  Review of the extent to which employees, managers and supervisors are fully 

informed of the provisions of this Manual.

Foreword 

This Manual provides policy and procedures for employees, supervisors, and managers 
throughout the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on position 
management and classification. The classification system and standards are tools for 
assisting management in accomplishing the Agency's mission and ensuring equal pay 
for substantially equal work. It assists in management activities such as designing 
organizations, recruiting for necessary expertise to perform the work, and establishing 
performance standards. 

12/2014 REVISION:  

OPM issued revised guidance for implementing new classification standards 
which are required to be identified in this manual. Questions regarding the 
administration of the PM/C Program should be directed to OCCHCO at (202) 646-
3962.

1-5.  Policy 

A.  The Chief Component Human Capital Officer has final authority and 

responsibility for all classification actions and the utilization of positions based 
on position management principles. 

B.  Standardized position descriptions (PD) for like and similar positions across 
FEMA are required in order to streamline the classification process and 
enable more rapid hiring. PDs will not be modified merely to add incidental 
duties, tasks, or reference to a local organization.  

C.  All PDs must accurately describe the work assigned to the employee. PDs 

should be concise yet clearly and completely state the major duties, 
responsibilities, and supervisory relationships. 

D.  The PD cover sheet used is the Optional Form (OF) 8. A PD is official only 

when the OF-8 contains the PD number, title, series, and grade, certification 
of PD accuracy by the supervisor/manager by means of signature, signature 
of the classification authority, and date of each.  

E.  All PDs will include the statement “Performs other duties as assigned.” In 

addition, position descriptions for all COREs and PFTs after 2012 include an 
emergency management requirement. 

F.  Vacant positions will be reviewed by program managers/supervisors before 
requesting a recruitment action. The review will include determining whether 
the duties of the position can be eliminated, assigned to other positions, or 
modified to permit classification at a lower grade. Management will certify the 
accuracy of the PD at the time of a request to fill a vacancy. 

G.  Reorganizations: Program offices shall consult with the Office of the Chief 

Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO) when considering a 
reorganization and before any reorganization action is implemented. 
OCCHCO provides subject matter expertise in relation to supportability of 
positions, position management advisory services, and other issues that may 
impact personnel.  

1-6.  Definitions 

A.  Accretion of Duties. An accretion of duties occurs when an employee’s 
position is classified at a higher grade because of the assignment of 
additional duties and responsibilities, job growth, or evolution of duties 
through unplanned circumstances. When the nature of a position gradually 
evolves over an extended period of time due to accretion of duties, the 
individual in the position may be promoted in place without competition. 
Instances of an accretion of duties should be very rare. 

6 

 
B.  Career Ladder Position. A position structured to allow for entry at a lower 

grade level than the full performance grade level which allows for progression 
to the full performance level. Typically, a position is announced and filled on a 
competitive basis with promotion to higher grade levels made on a non-
competitive basis. The career ladder refers to the range of grades to which 
the employee may be promoted, non-competitively, up to the classified full 
performance level of the position.   

C.  Classification. The analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a 

class under the position-classification plan established by Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM).   

D.  Classification Appeal. An employee’s request to the Office of the Chief 

Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO), DHS Chief Human Capital 
Officer (CHCO), or OPM to review the classification decision of the position to 
which the employee is currently assigned. 

E.  Classification Standard. A set of criteria developed and issued by OPM used 
to delineate different grade levels (as defined by law) to specific job tasks and 
work situations, thereby providing the basis for determining the appropriate 
title, occupational series, and grade for a given position. 

F.  Confidential Filer. The definition of confidential filer is the definition set forth in 

5 C.F.R. § 2634.905. 

G.  Factor Evaluation System (FES). A method of assigning grades to 

nonsupervisory General Schedule positions using nine evaluation factors 
which are assigned points for different levels.   

H.  Federal Wage System (FWS). Job grading and pay system that applies to 

employees in recognized trades or crafts, or other skilled mechanical crafts, 
or in unskilled, semiskilled, or skilled manual-labor occupations, and other 
employees including foremen and supervisors in positions having trade, craft, 
or laboring experience and knowledge as the paramount requirement. Under 
this system, pay is adjusted according to the rates paid by private industry for 
similar jobs in the same geographic area.  

I.  Full Performance Level (FPL). The highest grade level assignable to a 

particular position; the full performance level is reached when all the duties 
and responsibilities that the organization needs to be performed by a given 
position are, in fact, being accomplished with the degree of independence 
desired by management. 

J.  General Schedule (GS). Basic pay schedule established under Title 5 and 
adjusted by the President. A position is under the General Schedule if its 
primary duties require knowledge and experience in a line of work or 
discipline unrelated to trade, craft, or manual labor occupations. 

K.  Major Duties. Work assignments which represent the primary reason for a 
position’s existence and which govern qualification requirements. In most 
cases, major duties are those tasks that occupy at least 25% of an 
employee’s time. 

7 

 
L.  Pay Plan. Pay system or pay schedule under which an employee’s rate of pay 

is determined (e.g., GS, FWS). 

M.  Position. The work, consisting of the duties and responsibilities, assigned by 

competent authority for performance by an employee. 

N.  Position Audit. Sometimes referred to as a desk audit or position classification 

review is the process of examining and analyzing the duties and 
responsibilities assigned to a position for the purpose of determining the 
position’s proper pay plan, occupational series, title, and grade. 

O.  Position Description (PD). The official written description of management's 
assignment of duties, responsibilities, and supervisory relationships to a 
position.  

P.  Standard Position Description (SPD). A SPD is a standard PD that is used as 
appropriate when management’s requirements can be met most effectively by 
the establishment of a single PD covering two or more positions whose duties 
and responsibilities are basically the same, regardless of organizational 
location of the position. An SPD is used “as is” without change to describe the 
work of several positions within an organization whose duties are basically 
the same. 

Q.  Position Identification Number (PIN). A PIN is a unique alpha numeric 

identification code created by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) 
to signify a position at FEMA. The position could be permanent full time 
(PFT), Not to Exceed (NTE), or a Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery 
Employees (CORE).   

1-7.  Responsibilities 

A.  Chief Component Human Capital Officer is responsible for: 

1.  Providing policy direction and oversight for the Agency's Position 

Management and Classification (PM/C) Program; 

2.  Ensuring applicable collective bargaining agreements under pertinent 

labor relations statutes and agreements are honored; 

3.  Ensuring that FEMA employees are treated fairly and consistently, and 
without regard to any discriminatory or non-merit factor in the overall 
administration and implementation of the Agency's PM/C Program;  

4.  Ensuring that employees are provided information on FEMA’s position 

classification appeals process and their rights; 

5.  Providing final classification determinations; 

6.  Providing a determination on the utilization of positions based on position 

management principles; and 

7.  Coordinating and communicating with the DHS CHCO and OPM for 

position classifications appealed to DHS and/or OPM; and 

8 

 
8.  Applying new or updated OPM position classification standards and/or 

classification guides to covered positions within 12 months of the date of 
issuance. 

B.  Position Management and Classification Branch is responsible for: 

1.  Developing and providing PM/C program plans and program goals; 

2.  Developing and issuing PM/C program standard operating procedures and 

policy guidance and instructions; 

3.  Classifying positions and issuing PDs;  

4.  Providing prompt written notice to an employee whose position is 

reclassified to a lower grade based in whole or in part on a classification 
decision pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 511.602. If the reclassification is due to an 
OPM classification certificate issued under 5 U.S.C. § 5110, the prompt 
written notice must also explain the reasons for the reclassification action. 
In either case, the notice shall include: (a) applicable appeal rights 
regarding the classification decision; (b) applicable time limits within which 
the employee’s appeal must be filed in order to preserve any retroactive 
benefits under 5 C.F.R. § 511.703; and (c) any other appeal or grievance 
rights available under applicable law, rule, regulation, or negotiated 
agreement. 

5.  Coordinating with OCC Ethics Division and managers and supervisors to 

identify which positions under their supervision are required to file 
confidential financial disclosure reports; and 

6.  Providing advisory and consultative services to management regarding 

the PM/C program. 

C.  Managers and Supervisors are responsible for: 

1.  Establishing positions at the lowest grade possible to effectively perform 

organizational function; 

2.  Establishing, in collaboration with OCCHCO, the proper classification of 

positions under his/her direction. The supervisor assigns the duties, which 
ultimately determine the grade of each position, and certifies that the 
position description (PD) reflects those duties. This certification is also 
made by higher level supervisory and/or managerial personnel. Thus, 
when a Human Resources (HR) classification specialist assigns a grade 
(and hence a salary level) to a position, the supervisor and manager have 
played a key role in setting the proper grade; 

3.  Establishing or recommending, and maintaining within their area of 

responsibility, an effective organizational/position structure consistent with 
approved mission, manpower authorizations, and administrative 
authorities; 

4.  Assigning specific duties, responsibilities, and authorities to positions to 
achieve optimum balance of economy, effectiveness, skill utilization, 

9 

 
employee motivation, and/or development in conformance with the 
objectives of sound position management; 

5.  Considering the impact on all other positions within the organization 

supervised/managed before assigning duties to any position that will result 
in a higher grade;   

6.  Reviewing the organizational/position structure to determine changes that 

may be appropriate to improve the organization's efficiency and 
effectiveness if any of the following characteristics are present: 

a.  There exist supervisory layering and/or supervisor employee ratios 

that are out of line with other similar work operations; 

b.  Higher level duties have been fragmented into many positions so that 
they will be graded to the higher level despite the fact that all perform 
substantial amounts of lower level work; 

c.  There are overlaps in authorities and responsibilities which generate 

needless duplication of effort; 

d.  Skills and abilities are being required which exceed those actually 

necessary to do the work; 

e.  The staffing structure inadequately recognizes human factors implicit 
in attracting, motivating, training, promoting, and maintaining an 
effective work force (e.g., a proper mix of grade levels that are 
commensurate with work assignments and qualifications required, a 
stimulating and challenging work environment, opportunity to increase 
skills and advance to higher level positions); or 

f.  Available employee possessed skills and training are not being fully 

utilized; 

7.  Advising the Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer as 
appropriate, and as promptly as possible, of proposed changes in the 
organizational structure and/or changes in duties assigned to positions, 
and provide charts or other material pertinent to the change; 

8.  Before any vacant position is filled, reviewing it to determine whether the 

position: 

a. 

Is essential to the operation and is properly described; 

b.  Should be reclassified based on significant changes in the duties 

assigned; 

c.  Should be filled at a developmental/training level; or 

d. 

Is incumbent-only and can only be filled at a certain level;  

9.  Assisting the Position Management and Classification Branch in the 

preparation of clearly defined position descriptions and using established 
standard PDs when feasible and certify to their accuracy whenever the 
positions are established, amended, or filled; 

10 

 
10. Certifying in writing annually on the OF-8 as to the accuracy of each 

position description for which they are accountable; 

11. Advising employees of their right to review classification standards and to 

appeal the classification of their position; 

12. As appropriate, reviewing or arranging for review by subordinates, the 
classification standards and guides issued by the Office of Personnel 
Management; 

13. Providing an opportunity to lower level supervisors, by training or other 
means, to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively 
discharge their position management and classification responsibilities; 
and 

14. Coordinating with OCC Ethics Division and OCCHCO to identify which 

positions under their supervision should be classified as confidential filers. 

D.  Employees are responsible for: 

1.  Reviewing their PD to ensure that it accurately reflects the duties they are 

performing;  

2.  Raising discrepancies between the PD and the work with their immediate 

supervisor; and  

3.  Understanding the location of their position within the organization and 

operating within the appropriate management channels. 

1-8.  Reporting Requirements 

OCCHCO will collect the appropriate information relating to position management 
and classification and report to DHS CHCO, OPM, and FEMA OCC Ethics as 
directed.  

OCCHCO will post information via the FEMA weekly regarding changes to 
classification standards.

CHAPTER 2 - POSITION MANAGEMENT 

2-1.  General 

Position management is the continuous and systematic process of assuring that 
organizations and positions are structured efficiently and economically. It is the 
series of steps that managers and supervisors follow to determine the type of 
organizational structure required to fulfill the function(s) assigned to a particular 
unit and calculate how many positions are needed and how those positions will 
relate to one another. 

2-2.  Policy and Principles 

FEMA will establish and maintain only those positions necessary to accomplish 
Agency programs in the most effective, efficient, and economical manner. In line 
with this policy, supervisors and managers will observe the following position 
management principles in determining organizational structure, developing 
staffing plans, and assigning duties to individual positions: 

A.  Establish the fewest number of positions essential to accomplish the functions 

assigned. 

B.  Structure positions to avoid overlapping of duties, unnecessary positions, or 

fragmentation of work processes. 

C.  Abolish vacant positions if the duties can be redistributed or eliminated. 

D.  Optimize supervisor/employee ratios as follows: 

1.  First-level supervisors over GS positions supervise no less than six (6) 

positions; 

2.  First-level supervisors over trades and crafts and FWS positions supervise 

no less than eight (8) positions; and 

3.  Second-level supervisors and managers (GS or FWS) have no less than 

three (3) subordinate supervisors reporting to them. 

E.  Establish official deputy positions sporadically in large, complex organizations 

of at least fifty (50) employees. 

F.  Minimize the number of organizational levels, with emphasis on 

decentralization and delegation to the lowest possible working level. 

G.  Hire at the “entry” level whenever possible to ensure a balance between 

employees who perform the full performance level duties of the unit and the 
development of employees who perform more routine and lower level tasks. 

H.  Establish positions in such a way as to encourage career development and 

allow cross training consistent with the need to recruit and retain a diversified 
work force. 

I.  Review official PDs during performance plan discussions to determine 

whether the PD is current and accurate. Document the process on Block 23 
of the OF-8. 

12 

 
2-3. 

Implementation 

OCCHCO is responsible for advising management of their responsibility to 
ensure sound position management. OCCHCO will work with supervisors and 
managers to assure that: 

A.  Positions and organizations are structured in accordance with the position 

management principles enumerated above in Section 2-2; 

B.  Each employee has a current and properly classified position description 

which adequately describes the work assigned; and 

C.  Annual staffing plans are established within the established allocations for 

salaries and benefits determined by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer 
(OCFO). 

13 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 3 - POSITION CLASSIFICATION 

3-1.  General 

Position classification is a process through which Federal positions are assigned 
to a pay system, series, title, and grade or band, based on consistent application 
of position classification standards. 

A.  Classification determinations are based on the:  

1.  Work assigned to positions by the responsible management official; 

2.  Complexity of the work; 

3.  Level of assigned responsibility; 

4.  Outcome of products and/or services; 

5.  Knowledge and skills necessary to successfully perform the assigned 

work; and 

6.  Proper application of applicable OPM position classification guidelines 

such as standards and functional guides. 

B.  A position classification standard is a set of criteria developed by OPM 

relating different grade levels (as defined by law) to specific work situations, 
thereby providing the basis for determining the appropriate title, series, and 
grade for a given position. 

C.  OCCHCO will use the position classification standards, guides, and job family 

standards tools issued by OPM when evaluating the work of positions.   

3-2.  Procedures 

A.  Administration 

The PM/C program will be administered to provide management with 
information and advice on organizations, reorganizations, and other position 
and workforce management matters. 

B.  Circumstances Requiring Position Classification Action 

Managers and supervisors have a continuing responsibility for ensuring that 
PDs are current and accurate in terms of assigned duties and responsibilities, 
and that necessary position classification action is initiated when: 

1.  A new position is established; 

2.  The principal duties and responsibilities of a position have changed 

materially; 

3.  A review of multiple positions is proposed (a group classification review 
consisting of five or more positions requires the approval of an Assistant 
or Regional Administrator or an Office Director); 

4.  A supervisory position is vacated;  

5.  A PD is over five years old;  

14 

 
6.  OPM issues a new classification standard or guide. All new OPM position 
classification standards and/or classification guides to covered positions 
must be applied within 12 months of the date of issuance. From the date 
of receipt of the new standard, no new classification action may take place 
unless the position has been described in the required format and 
classified according to the new standard. See section 3-4.G for additional 
information on the application of new and updated position classification 
standards; and 

7.  OPM issues a classification certificate (e.g., as a result of an appeal 
decision or survey finding). NOTE: Agencies shall review their own 
classification decisions for identical, similar, or related positions to insure 
consistency with a classification certificate from OPM. 

3-3.  Position Classification Records 

CCHCO is responsible for maintaining all official PDs, records, files, and other 
material incidental to the classification of positions and providing access for 
review by regulatory/reviewing entities.  

A.  Position description numbers will be assigned by OCCHCO, in accordance 

with internal operating procedures. 

B.  When new PDs are classified, an evaluation statement will be prepared which 

explains in sufficient detail the basis of the position classification. The 
evaluation statement will remain in OCCHCO as an official part of the 
position. 

C.  Supervisors and employees should review PDs, at least annually, to ensure 

that they are accurate. If a PD is no longer current and accurate, the 
supervisor should contact OCCHCO and inform the servicing HR 
Classification Specialist. The servicing HR Classification Specialist will 
determine the amount of change that has occurred in the assigned duties and 
responsibilities and advise the supervisor on the appropriate format and 
procedure for updating the PD.  

3-4.  Position Classification Review (Desk Audit or Position Review) 

A formal position audit or position review with an employee and/or the 
employee’s supervisor may be used by an HR Specialist/Classifier to gather first-
hand information about a position. It is an interview designed to highlight the key 
or major aspects of a position. Findings are then compared to the current OPM 
position classification standard(s) and other organizational materials to ensure 
that the PD accurately describes the major duties and is properly classified.  

Position audits are conducted via telephone or at the employee's workplace (on-
site audit) whenever possible. On-site audits are conducted to gain pertinent job 
observations and other information that is otherwise unattainable. An audit is 
conducted when significant changes are being proposed or have occurred to a 
position when it is determined that additional information is needed to classify the 
position, such as: mission changes, downsizing, reorganization, technological 
advances, additional duties, elimination of obsolete programs, practices and 

15 

 
requirements, etc. These and other changes can have an impact on the 
classification of the position in terms of its title, pay plan, series, and grade. 
These classification elements not only determine what salary the employee will 
be paid, but categorize the work experience he/she will gain while occupying the 
position, and specifies the qualification requirements (knowledge, skills, and 
abilities) necessary when filling the position.  

It is critical that the manager promptly advise OCCHCO of position and 
organization changes and provide information pertaining to the change (e.g., 
revised position description, revisions to staffing plans, reorganization proposals, 
identifying the position(s) that will be impacted, etc.). 

Position classification determinations require a three-step process of fact finding, 
analysis of position data, and the documentation of findings. The primary and 
most complete source of position information is the position audit and 
subsequent supervisory review. A supervisor or an employee may request a 
position audit. An employee or supervisor would request a position audit if the 
new or changed duties or responsibilities are significant and have been 
performed for a minimum of 120 days and are expected to indefinitely remain as 
regular duties. Additional information on position audits can be found on the 
OCCHCO intranet webpage, “Position Audit FAQs.” 

A.  Requesting a Position Audit 

1.  Supervisory Request for a Position Audit 

To request a formal position audit review, supervisors shall prepare, using 
their respective Division or Office internal procedures, and forward the 
position description request form, FEMA Form 252-0-1 (2/14), to 
OCCHCO specifying how the position has changed. To the extent 
possible, the request should explain the reason for the position audit 
request, cite examples of current work assignments, and specify the 
manner in which the position is supervised. The request shall be 
accompanied by an updated PD and detailed organizational chart 
identifying positions certified by management.  

2.  Employee Request for a Position Audit 

An individual employee may initiate a request for a position audit. As with 
a supervisory request for a position audit, the employee must prepare and 
submit the position description request form that explains how the position 
has changed, cite examples of typical work assignments, and describe the 
manner in which the work is supervised. A revised description of duties 
and responsibilities should also accompany the request. Although the 
employee may submit the request directly to OCCHCO, the preferred 
method is to send the request through the employee’s first-level 
supervisor and Executive Officer/Human Resources Liaison.  

B.  Processing a Position Audit Request 

Upon OCCHCO’s receipt of the position audit request, a HR Classification 
Specialist shall be assigned to review the request and determine the 

16 

 
appropriate course of action. Position audit assignments will be made based 
upon knowledge of the organization and occupation, as well as overall 
workload. The HR Classification Specialist will contact management and the 
appropriate administrative staff to acknowledge receipt of the position audit 
request and obtain any additional information, and schedule the position audit 
at a mutually convenient time.  

C.  Conducting the Position Audit 

The position audit interview is conducted via telephone or at the employee’s 
work site. The HR Specialist will meet with the first-level supervisor and the 
employee. An audit summary of major duties and responsibilities may be 
developed and provided to the supervisor and employee for review and 
concurrence if it is determined that the revised PD accompanying the audit 
request does not accurately reflect work performed.  

D.  Completing the Evaluation Statements 

The purpose of an evaluation statement is to set forth the rationale for 
position classification determinations for pay plan, title, series, and grade as 
well as credit for each factor level. The evaluation statement should include 
any information that will assist the reader in understanding the writer’s 
rationale in the decision-making process. Evaluation statements must be 
prepared and filed with the original classified PD. Evaluation statements 
should always be signed and dated by the HR Specialist/Classifier. 

A written evaluation statement will be issued to the Chief, Position 
Management and Classification Branch, OCCHCO. The evaluation statement 
shall include a determination of the title, series, and grade level of the 
position. Any extenuating circumstances that prevent the HR Specialist from 
making a title, series, and/or grade level determination shall be discussed and 
resolved with the Executive Officer/HR Liaison before the evaluation report is 
issued. Where a reclassification to a higher grade is supported, a decision as 
to whether or not the reclassified position shall be subject to competition shall 
also be indicated. Evaluation reports are pre-decisional internal OCCHCO 
working documents. 

E.  Reporting and Acting on Position Audit Findings 

The Chief, Position Management and Classification Branch will issue a 
determination of findings memorandum to the requesting employee’s first and 
second level supervisors. This memorandum will also advise of the 
employee’s right to file an official classification appeal to OCCHCO, DHS, 
and/or OPM and will provide a contact number for further information on the 
appeals process. It is the first line supervisor’s responsibility to inform the 
employee of the result of the position audit. 

Regardless of the results of the position audit, the supervisor should meet 
with the employee and provide him or her with a copy of the determination of 
findings. If the position audit findings conclude that the position supports 

17 

 
reclassification to a higher grade, the supervisor shall take immediate action 
to effect the reclassification or reassign/reallocate the work.  

If reclassification to a higher grade is supported by OCCHCO, the supervisor 
may take action to promote the incumbent (if such action is permitted under 
the Agency’s Merit Promotion Plan), advertise the higher graded position in 
accordance with the Agency’s Merit Promotion Plan, or change the title or 
series as recommended in the position audit findings. Supervisors may also 
consider workload projections and, if it is determined that work at the higher 
level is not expected to continue over the long term, the supervisor may 
assign the higher-level duties to a higher graded employee. The feasibility of 
a temporary promotion may also be explored with OCCHCO as an option to 
resolve the short-term work issue.  

An employee who is placed in a lower-graded position as a result of the 
position being reduced as a result of a reclassification is entitled to retain the 
grade held immediately before the reduction for a period of two years. An 
employee is eligible for grade retention based on a reclassification of his or 
her position only if, immediately before the reduction in grade, that position 
was classified at the existing grade or a higher grade for a continuous period 
of at least one year. 

In the unusual circumstance when a classification action results in a lower 
grade or a loss of pay and the employee is not entitled to grade and pay 
retention, an appeal decision that reverses the original classification action 
may be made retroactively. See Chapter 6.  

F.  Effective Date of Actions 

The effective date for promotion actions resulting from position audits, 
assuming that the action meets all the requirements as an exception to the 
Agency’s Merit Promotion Plan, should normally be effective no later than the 
second pay period after the decision by the supervisor. Promotion actions 
resulting from position audits are not retroactive. No entitlement exists for 
compensation at a higher grade level prior to the effective date of the 
promotion. 

G.  New OPM Classification Standards and Guides 

1.  Implementation of New Standards/Guides 

i.  All new OPM position classification standards and/or guides to covered 
positions must be applied within 12 months of the date of issuance. 
From the date of receipt of the new standard, no new classification 
action may take place unless the position has been described in the 
required format and classified according to the new standard. 

ii.  When implementing a new classification standard, FEMA will follow 

OPM guidance by: 

a.  Applying the standard to new positions and positions under 

classification appeal first. Then applying the standard to vacant 

18 

 
positions prior to initial recruitment; positions where grade change 
is likely (predicted); and standard position descriptions, if 
applicable; 

b.  Using pen-and-ink changes for minor revisions with no grade 

impact; and 

c.  Processing mass changes, as appropriate, rather than individual 

personnel actions. 

2.  Position Classification Appeals 

i. 

If an employee who encumbers a covered position files a position 
classification appeal with FEMA or OPM prior to implementing a new 
OPM standard, FEMA must immediately apply the new standard in 
order to properly adjudicate the appeal. 

ii.  In the event of a classification appeal, the implementation of a new 

standard should include ensuring that the position description is in the 
same format as the standard used to evaluate the work. 

iii.  While it is generally advisable to describe positions using the same 
format as the classification standards that cover them, outside of a 
classification appeal, it is not necessary to re-describe existing 
descriptions of properly classified positions solely for the purpose of 
changing the format to match the new standard. 

3.  Inaccurate Position Descriptions 

It is FEMA’s policy that, to the maximum extent possible, position 
descriptions are accurately maintained. However, if the program 
manager/supervisor determines that a position description(s) covered by 
the new standard is inaccurate, he or she should immediately contact 
OCCHCO for assistance in updating the position description(s) so that the 
new standard can be applied.  

3-5.  Annual Position Review 

A.  Nature of the Review 

FEMA requires that an annual review be conducted of all positions. The need 
for each position must be considered and those found to be necessary must 
be reviewed to assure that the position description is adequate and 
classification is proper. Action should be taken to make appropriate changes 
to position descriptions to reflect changes that have occurred in employee job 
assignments. These changes in duties could affect the title, series, and/or 
grade assigned to the position. 

B.  Supervisory Responsibility for Annual Review 

In conjunction with the annual performance ratings, each supervisor will 
review the current description of each authorized position (occupied or 
vacant) in his/her organization to determine if it is accurate, complete, and 
essential to effective operations. When feasible, employees will participate in 

19 

 
reviews and discussions of their positions in order to promote a full 
understanding of position requirements. 

C.  Supervisory Responsibility for Annual Certification 

Following the annual performance ratings for the rating period ending 
December 31 of each year, the rating official will certify to the currency of 
positions and initial the OF-8. The rating official will document any specific 
changes to the position description (i.e., additions, deletions, modifications) 
and provide to OCCHCO Position Management and Classification Branch. 

D.  OCCHCO Responsibility for Annual Certification 

OCCHCO, Position Management and Classification Branch, will provide any 
needed assistance to supervisors/managers during the course of the annual 
review, examine the changes to position descriptions that are submitted, take 
appropriate action to update and otherwise change any inaccurate position 
descriptions reported, and determine if a change in title, series, and/or grade 
is warranted. 

E.  Office of Personal Management and Department of Homeland Security Audits 

FEMA positions may be reviewed by representatives of the Department of 
Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management during periodic 
human capital accountability audits. OCCHCO will participate in these audits, 
provide any needed assistance to all concerned, and attempt to resolve any 
problems or disagreements concerning the classification of positions. All 
employees are expected to cooperate fully with audit representatives. 

20 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 4 - POSITION DESCRIPTIONS 

4-1.  General 

A position description (PD), for General Schedule (GS) positions or job 
description (JD) for Federal Wage System (FWS) jobs, is an official, written 
statement of the major duties, responsibilities, and supervisory relationship of a 
position. DHS supervisors and managers who direct the work of an 
organizational unit are responsible and accountable for organizing work in an 
efficient, effective manner, and for using resources to carry out the missions of 
their organizations in the same manner. Supervisors are to ensure that 
employees have copies of their position descriptions (PDs/JDs) and shall 
objectively, expeditiously, and fairly consider employee concerns over the 
accuracy of their PDs, and the classification of their positions. 

While the manager/supervisor is ultimately responsible for ensuring the currency 
and accuracy of an employee’s PD, who prepares the PD itself, whether it be the 
supervisor, the employee, a contractor, a HR Specialist, or someone else, is 
management’s right to decide. 

The body of the PD will, at the minimum, include the name and location of the 
organization where the position exists; percentage of time spent on the major 
duties; and will address the same specific grade level criteria factors used in the 
classification standard (s) to evaluate the position. All PFT and CORE GS-15 or 
equivalent and below PDs must meet this requirement and must include a 
statement (normally on the coversheet) signed by the supervisor attesting to the 
accuracy of the description.   

Under rare circumstances, it may be acceptable to develop and classify PDs 
based on management's best estimate of what the duties and responsibilities of a 
position will be following a reorganization or the establishment of a new program. 
PDs would be appropriately annotated to reflect their projected basis and would 
be subject to review six months after incumbency to ensure accuracy. 

4-2.  Federal Wage System 

Federal Wage System (FWS) descriptions are called Job Descriptions (JDs). The 
FWS covers work in a recognized trade or craft or other skilled mechanical craft, 
or in an unskilled, semiskilled, or skilled manual labor occupation. FWS 
employees are paid the local prevailing rate for blue collar work based upon 
annual wage surveys. Specific guidance on FWS jobs can be found in OPM’s 
Introduction to the FWS Job Grading System at 
http://opm.gov/fedclass/fwsintro.pdf, Section IV of OPM’s Introduction to the 
Position Classification Standards at http://opm.gov/fedclass/gsintro.pdf, and in 
the OPM Operating Manual Federal Wage System – Appropriated Fund, at 
http://opm.gov/oca/wage/appfund/. 

For non-supervisory jobs, the FWS employs a “whole job” evaluation method 
requiring comparison of four factors: (1) skills and knowledge required, (2) 
responsibility, (3) physical effort, (4) working conditions. Additionally, the key 
determination of FWS coverage is a position’s requirement to have trades, crafts, 

21 

 
or laboring experience and knowledge as the paramount requirement for the 
performance of its primary duty. 

The grade assigned to a FWS non-supervisory job is based upon the highest 
level of work performed on a “regular and recurring” (not majority of the time) 
basis.  

4-3.  PD Shortcuts 

A.  Major Changes. Whenever a significant change takes place in the major 
duties of a position, in the way those duties are supervised, or governing 
qualifications, the PD must be amended or rewritten and evaluated. A 
significant change means the addition or deletion of a major duty or a change 
in level of supervisory controls over the work. Any amendment to a position 
that will affect the title, series, or grade requires a new coversheet. A PD can 
only be amended twice before a complete rewrite and new PD is required. 

B.  Minor Changes. Changes in a PD that will not affect the title, series, or grade 
can usually be accommodated through minor editing. If the modification only 
involves a word or two, the change may easily be handled through a “pen and 
ink” correction. If the change involves several phrases or paragraphs, then 
the modifications may be typed on a separate page and attached to the PD. 

C.  Statement of Differences. A Statement of Differences (SoD) is a succinct 

description of the differences between the duties, responsibilities, or working 
conditions set forth in a currently established position description, and those 
of the position being described. When a position being described is 
substantially similar to an existing position in the same organizational unit and 
classified with the same series and title, it may not be necessary to draft an 
entirely new PD. In many cases, the already classified and approved PD may 
be used along with a brief SoD, attached to a completed coversheet, 
describing how the two positions differ. A SoD is particularly useful when 
management decides to fill a position at a grade level below the full 
performance level. In such a case, the PD for the new position would consist 
of the classified and approved PD for the full performance level work plus a 
completed coversheet and a statement addressing the modified expectations 
associated with the lower grade (e.g., at the lower grade level, supervision 
would normally be increased while knowledge required to perform the work 
would be decreased). A SoD may not be used to describe higher level duties 
(i.e., the grade of the already existing PD must be at or above the grade of 
the position being described), nor should it be used to describe supervisory or 
leadership positions. While use of the statement of difference is not 
mandatory, it does promote efficiency. 

D.  Developmental PDs. Position descriptions for developmental positions often 

employ the SoD approach. Developmental PDs need to be linked to the target 
PD as well as to each of the career ladder positions leading to the target 
position. At the minimum they should indicate the title, series, grade, and PD 
number of the next rung of the career ladder as well as the full performance 
level (FPL) target grade and PD number. 

22 

 
E.  Standard PDs. Standard position descriptions (also referred to as “generic” or 
“template” PDs) are available for a large number of positions. A standard PD 
is an “off the shelf” document that may be used “as is” without change to 
describe the work of several positions within an organization whose duties are 
basically the same. Since these standard documents have already been 
evaluated and classified, no further review is necessary. There is, however, 
one important exception: Standard PDs should not be used as the basis for 
an accretion unless an audit has been performed verifying the employee is 
actually performing the higher level duties and responsibilities described in 
the Standard PD and that the major duties of the position being replaced by 
the standard PD are also present in the standard PD to which the employee is 
being accreted. Contact your servicing HR Classification Specialist for further 
information on the appropriateness and availability of Standard PDs. 
Additional information on establishing position descriptions can be found on 
OCCHCO’s intranet webpage. 

F.  Coversheets. All PDs will have a signed coversheet, OF-8. The signatures 
reflect the supervisor and/or approving official authorized to establish or fill 
the position and the person authorized to classify the position. The 
coversheet should reflect the position’s current organizational location, 
associated career ladder positions, title, series grade, PD number of any 
positions replaced, and the classification standard(s) used to classify the 
position. Finally, if any of the following items are checked on the coversheet 
they must also be annotated in the Remarks Section, body of the PD, and/or 
in the evaluation statement: 

1.  Position Sensitivity and Risk level Designation. Indicate that the 

designation has been approved by the Security Office. 

2.  Testing Designated Position (TDP). Indicate that the designation has been 
approved by the Security and HR offices and that as a TDP it is subject to 
initial and random drug testing. 

3.  Coding Position Sensitivity. Determine the appropriate coding in 
accordance with OPM’s Guide to Data Standards Part A: Human 
Resources: 

a.  Not Designated. No designation of sensitivity has been made. (Not 
valid for use on Standard Forms 50 or 52, Optional Form 8, or 
equivalent agency form.)  

b.  Non-sensitive (NS) National Security Risk. Potentially prejudicial to the 
national security. Adverse impact on the efficiency of the service: 
Potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the agency 
mission with program responsibilities that affect the efficiency of the 
service.   

Low Risk (LR) Public Trust Position. Adverse impact on the efficiency 
of the service: Potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to 

23 

 
the agency mission with program responsibilities which affect the 
efficiency of the service. 

c.  Noncritical-Sensitive (NCS) National Security Risk. Potential for 
damage to potential for serious damage to the national security. 
Adverse impact on the efficiency of the service: Potential for moderate 
to serious impact involving duties of considerable importance to the 
agency mission with significant program responsibilities that affect the 
efficiency of the service.  

d.  Critical-Sensitive (CS) National Security Risk. Potential for 

exceptionally grave damage to the national security. Adverse impact 
on the efficiency of the service: Potential for exceptionally grave impact 
involving duties of clearly major importance to the agency mission with 
major program responsibilities that affect the efficiency of the service. 
Normally also a TDP. 

e.  Special-Sensitive (SS) National Security Risk. Potential for inestimable 
damage to the national security. Adverse impact on the efficiency of 
the service: Potential for inestimable impact involving duties especially 
critical to the agency mission with broad scope and authority (e.g., 
overall direction of a major Government program) or other extremely 
important responsibilities that affect the overall efficiency of the 
service. Normally a TDP. 

f.  Moderate Risk (MR) Public Trust Position. Adverse impact on the 
efficiency of the service: Potential for moderate to serious impact 
involving duties of considerable importance to the agency or program 
mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of 
customer services to the public.  

g.  High Risk (HR) Public Trust Position. Adverse impact on the efficiency 
of the service: Potential for exceptionally serious impact involving 
duties especially critical to the agency or a program mission with broad 
scope of policy or program authority. 

h.  Emergency positions. If the position has been designated as Mission 

Critical (MC) in an event of an emergency, natural, or man-made crisis, 
it should be so reflected on the coversheet and in the body of the PD. 

4.  The PD must include whether the position requires the employee to file a 

confidential financial disclosure report. 

G.  Titling Practices. The purpose of a position title is to communicate an 

immediate understanding and identification of the job. Classifiers will title 
position with Section H of OPM’s Introduction to the Position Classification 
Standards and applicable classification standards. Titles assigned by the 
classifier and annotated on the coversheet are designated the official title for 
pay and other personnel purposes. The requirement to use official titles 
however does not preclude supervisors from using unofficial titles for other 
purposes (e.g., organizational charts, telephone directories, business cards, 

24 

 
meetings, conferences, etc.). Organizational and functional titles do not 
replace, but complement official position titles.  

H.  Constructed titles. Supervisors may designate the official title of positions in 
occupational series for which OPM has not prescribed titles, e.g., the GS-
0301, GS-0340, GS-0501 series. They may use any basic position title that 
describes the work of the position; however, they may not use as a basic 
position title any title OPM has prescribed for another series. 

I.  Parenthetical titles. For some occupational series (e.g., 0201, 2210), OPM 
has prescribed certain parenthetical titles to be used as appropriate for 
positions in those series. Only those designations may be used. OCCHCO 
may supplement the official OPM title with parenthetical designations when it 
is determined that the parenthetical title would add materially to the 
understanding and identification of the position and when the duties and 
qualifications reflected in the parenthetical title are clearly apparent in the 
position description itself. 

J.  Student Trainee. (XX99 series) are to be titled Student Trainee followed by 
the parenthetical title consistent with the occupation (e.g., Student Trainee 
(Administration), GS-0399-04 for a Management Analyst student trainee). 

K.  Abbreviations. For consistency and ease of gathering and sorting report data, 
DHS classifiers are encouraged to use the abbreviations listed in APPENDIX 
1 in their titling practices. 

L.  Collateral Duties. A PD may have collateral duties that are unrelated to the 

primary purpose of the position. Collateral duties generally take only a small 
percent of the employee's time (never more than 50%) and cannot (by 
definition) affect the classification of the position. Collateral duties must be 
described including time percentage spent on the duties. The duty statement 
should be documented and dated. A typical collateral duty assignment would 
be an Employee Assistance Program Coordinator. 

25 

 
 
 
5-1.  Policy 

CHAPTER 5 - CAREER LADDERS 

This chapter contains the proper and improper uses of career ladder positions. It 
also provides prohibitive policy for the use of career ladder positions to the GS-
14 and GS-15 level. Where this policy conflicts with existing negotiated 
agreements, including applicable Merit Promotion Plans, the agreement takes 
precedence over this instruction for covered employees. 

5-2.  Establishing Career Ladders 

Establishing career ladder positions can optimize efficiency, productivity, and 
organizational effectiveness by broadening the pool of applicants when filling 
vacant positions; enhancing employee motivation and job satisfaction through 
planned employee development; reducing time to process promotions and 
administrative costs by providing non-competitive advancement within the career 
ladder; enhancing workforce retention by providing internal career opportunities; 
and lowering average human capital costs by including a range of pay levels. A 
career ladder is established based upon a classification analysis that sufficient 
work exists for all employees on a regular and recurring basis at the full 
performance level to support the grade. 

Program Offices must consider the following factors when deciding to establish a 
career ladder for a position: 

1.  Size of Applicant Pool. Career ladders are a useful tool when recruitment for 
the position is difficult at higher grade levels. Recruiting at lower grade levels 
can broaden the applicant pool. 

2.  Availability of Training Staff. Career ladders should only be established when 

there is available senior staff with the breadth and scope of technical 
knowledge necessary to train the incumbent.  

3.  Uniqueness of Duties. If a position requires unique, specialized qualifications 
where there is no staff available or knowledgeable to train or develop the 
incumbent, a career ladder will not be established. 

4.  Risk Management. For a position where anything less than full performance 

would put FEMA at risk, a career ladder will not be established. 

5.  Supervisory Status. Career ladders will not be established for supervisory 

positions. 

6.  Grade Level. Positions graded above the GS-13 level will not be established 
as career ladders. Rare exceptions may be made to this rule with justification 
and prior approval from the Deputy Administrator and Chief Component 
Human Capital Officer. 

5-3.  Documentation 

All requests to establish and fill career ladder positions at any grade level must 
include the appropriate documentation, to include: 

26 

 
1.  A signed OF-8 from the position’s supervisor; 

2.  A Position Description (PD) or Statement of Differences for each intervening 

level in the career ladder that refers to the full performance PD; 

3.  Appropriate job analysis relevant to each of the grade levels. Job 

requirements for trainee grade levels are normally not the same as for full 
performance grade levels; and 

4.  Appropriate criteria (e.g. questions for the automated recruitment system) that 

aligns with the job analysis. 

5-4.  Use of Career Ladders 

If a career ladder position is established and filled, supervisors/managers should: 

1.  Provide employees increasingly difficult assignments and training to prepare 

them for the next higher grade; 

2.  Monitor training progress continuously to enable subsequent promotions in a 

timely manner; 

3.  Clearly communicate to applicants the normal expected span of time between 
subsequent promotions subject to successful performance, especially if that 
time frame exceeds one year between grade levels; 

4.  Ensure funding plans accommodate subsequent promotions of employees 

selected below the full performance level; 

5.  Promote employees who demonstrate the ability to successfully perform the 

next higher level duties and responsibilities in the career ladder in accordance 
with the specific training agreement or collective bargaining agreements; and 

6.  Provide remedial assistance to employees who are not ready for promotion to 

enhance their performance and future success. 

5-5.  Use of Career Ladder Positions to GS-14 and GS-15 Levels 

It is generally prohibited for Program Offices to establish and fill career ladder 
positions at any grade level with promotion potential to the GS-14 and GS-15 
levels, except with approval from the Deputy Administrator or Chief Component 
Human Capital Officer.  

Positions at the GS-14 and GS-15 level require a unique combination of 
technical, managerial, and leadership skills. It is difficult to accurately predict 
success of any individual for the full performance GS-14 or GS-15 grade level 
who has not yet performed at the next lower grade for the target position.  

Establishing grade levels of high graded positions requires considerable 
justification. Program Offices able to employ a lower graded employee in a higher 
graded position (PIN) are less likely to be able to support that requirement. 

27 

 
 
 
CHAPTER 6 - CLASSIFICATION APPEALS 

6-1.  Purpose 

This chapter contains the policy and procedures regarding position classification 
appeals. GS employees may choose to appeal to OCCHCO or DHS CHCO 
instead of or before appealing to OPM. FWS employees may appeal to 
OCCHCO, but must appeal to DHS CHCO before continuing an appeal to OPM. 
OCCHCO and the Office of Equal Rights (OER) shall ensure that employees are 
free from intimidation, restraint, interference, coercion, harassment, 
discrimination, or reprisal in pursuing their appeals. 

6-2.  Coverage 

All GS employees in grades GS-1 through 15 and all FWS employees have the 
right to appeal the classification of their positions, including the pay plan, series, 
grade, and the inclusion under or exclusion from Chapter 51 of Title 5, U.S.C. of 
the official position by the Agency or OPM.   

6-3.  Process 

The levels in the appeal process are:  

•  OCCHCO  

•  DHS CHCO 

•  OPM. 

It is the employee's prerogative to appeal either through successively higher 
levels in a series of appeals, or directly to DHS CHCO or OPM. 

NOTE: Appealing directly to a higher organizational level (for example, OPM) 
precludes a later appeal to a lower organizational level. OPM decisions are 
binding on the Agency. 

The Agency or PM/C Program will notify promptly in writing an employee whose 
position is reclassified to a lower grade based in whole or in part on a 
classification decision pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 511.602. See Section 1-7.B.4. 
above.    

6-4.  Appellant’s Representative 

1.  When preparing and presenting a classification appeal, an employee has the 
right to be represented and advised by a person of his or her own choosing, 
except that FEMA shall have the right to disallow the employee's choice 
when: 

a.  The representative selected is another FEMA or DHS employee and the 

choice of that employee conflicts with the priority needs of the 
Government or would result in unreasonable costs to the Government; or 

b.  The representative selected represents a conflict of interest or conflict of 

position, or the appearance of such conflict (e.g., the proposed 
representative is in the management chain over the position, or the 

28 

 
proposed representative exercises classification authority for the appealed 
position or others in the organization). 

2.  When the Agency disallows an employee's selected representative, the 

Agency will notify the employee in writing and explain the reason(s) within 15 
business days.  

6-5.  Official Time 

Employees are entitled to a reasonable amount of official time to prepare for and 
present a position classification appeal. Under most circumstances, this time 
should amount to eight or fewer hours. However, supervisors and managers are 
expected to use judgment and discretion in granting employee requests of official 
time for this purpose; more than eight hours may be appropriate on rare 
occasions. 

If an employee's representative is a FEMA or DHS employee, the representative 
is also entitled to eight or fewer hours of official time for the same purpose.  

6-6.  Non-appealable Issues 

Employees may not appeal the following issues in a position classification 
appeal:  

A.  Actions taken by authorized management officials to add to, delete from, or 

otherwise change the duties and responsibilities of a PD. Inclusion or 
exclusion of a major duty in the official PD or the accuracy of the PD is non-
appealable. (Note: 5 C.F.R. § 511.607(a)(1) provides that where, in the 
course of a proper classification appeal to OPM, management and the 
employee cannot agree on the accuracy of the PD, OPM will decide the 
appeal based upon the actual duties and responsibilities assigned by 
management and performed by the employee.) 

B.  The accuracy, consistency, or use of supplemental classification guides. 

C.  The title of the position, unless a specific title is authorized in a published 

OPM position classification standard or guide, or the title reflects a 
qualification requirement or authorized area of specialization. 

D.  The classification of a position to which the employee is not officially assigned 

by an official personnel action, including a detail or assignment to duties 
outside the scope of the normally performed duties specified in the official 
position description. 

E.  The pay system, series, or grade of a position to which the employee is 

detailed or temporarily promoted. However, an employee serving under a 
time-limited promotion of two years or more may appeal the position's 
classification. 

F.  A proposed classification decision not yet made effective by an official 

personnel action. 

G.  The adequacy of the classification criteria in any OPM published classification 

guide or standard. 

29 

 
H.  An appellate classification decision issued in the form of a certificate by OPM 
as a result of an employee appeal, when there has been no change in the 
applicable classification standard(s) or guide(s), or in the major duties and 
responsibilities assigned the position. 

I.  The classification of an employee's position based on position-to-position 

comparisons and not criteria in classification standards. 

J.  A rate of pay or the propriety of a wage schedule rate. 

K.  Any other issues, not specifically mentioned above, which are excluded from 

appeal under applicable legal authorities, including OPM regulations. 

Issues that are not permitted to be heard through a position classification appeal 
may be addressed through the Agency's administrative grievance procedures or 
through the applicable negotiated grievance process, as appropriate. 

6-7.  Appeal Decisions 

An appeal decision from OPM which specifies the correct title (if one is 
prescribed), series, grade, and/or pay system of a position is a classification 
certificate. A classification certificate is binding on all administrative, certifying, 
payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials of the Government. It may or may not 
require an official personnel action. If a personnel action is required as a result of 
the classification certificate, such personnel action must be implemented within 
the time frame specified by the decision. Appeal decisions rendered by the DHS 
CHCO are binding on FEMA in the same manner as OPM decisions are binding 
on DHS. 

6-8.  Time Limits 

Generally, an employee may submit a classification appeal of his or her official 
position at any time.  

If an employee is appealing an Agency decision or an OPM classification 
certificate issued under 5 U.S.C. § 5103 or 5110, the employee must promptly 
appeal if he or she disagrees with the decision or classification certificate. Under 
these circumstances, an appeal is considered to be prompt if it is initiated within 
15 calendar days of receipt of an Agency decision or an OPM classification 
certificate, unless good cause is shown.   

In order to preserve the right to a retroactive adjustment to a classification action 
which resulted in a loss of grade or pay, the employee must file the initial request 
for review to the Agency or OPM not later than within 15 calendar days after the 
effective date of the reclassification action. Subsequent appeals from an agency 
or OPM classification decision must be filed not later than 15 calendar days 
following receipt of written notification of a final agency administrative decision or 
15 calendar days after the effective date of the action taken as a result of the 
classification decision, whichever is later.  

30 

 
 
When an employee requests reconsideration of an OPM appeal decision, he or 
she must do so in writing to OPM and must file the request to OPM no more than 
45 calendar days after the decision was issued.  

6-9.  Documentation 

1.  Appeals to OCCHCO or the DHS CHCO 

A.  Appeals to OCCHCO or the DHS CHCO must be submitted in writing and

          AR-HR   

Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses, Retention Allowances, 
and Student Loan Repayments 

1.  Purpose.  This instruction establishes the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s 
(FEMA’s) policy and plan for the use and payment of recruitment and relocation bonuses, 
retention allowances, and student loan repayments necessary to attract highly qualified 
applicants or retain highly qualified employees in positions that would otherwise be 
difficult-to-fill. 

2.  Applicability and Scope.  Positions and types of appointments to which these  
incentives apply are outlined below.  

 a.  Covered Positions.  

  (1)  Individuals appointed to general schedule, prevailing rate (wage), senior-level 

and scientific or professional, senior executive service, executive schedule, and law 
enforcement positions, and positions filled by Presidential appointment (except the head of 
an agency) are eligible for recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances.    

            (2)  Individuals appointed to any position except one that is excepted from the

policy-advocating character (e.g., Schedule C, Presidential appointment with Senate 
confirmation (PAS), Non-Career Senior Executive Service) are eligible for student loan 
repayments.  

(3)  OPM may approve other categories upon written request from the head of the 

employing agency. 

b.  Qualifying Appointments.  

(1)  Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses and Retention Allowances.  Individuals

(2) Student Loan Repayments.  Individuals appointed to or occupying a term or 

nontemporary appointment in the competitive or excepted service are eligible for this 
incentive provided the appointment equals or exceeds the length of the service agreement 
required for the bonus amount.  Individuals appointed to or occupying a temporary 
appointment in the competitive or excepted service are only eligible if they are serving on 
an appointment leading to conversion to a term or permanent appointment (career or career 
conditional) such as the 30% Disabled Veterans Hiring Authority. 

3.  Authorities.  

a.  Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.) section 5753 (5 U.S.C. 5753) and Title 5 Code

National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, and 5 CFR, Part 537, Repayment 
of Student Loans. 

4.  Policy.  FEMA shall ensure fair and consistent application of the procedures outlined 
in this instruction.  Incentives will only be used when it is necessary to attract or retain 
highly qualified applicants or employees in difficult-to-fill positions.  We will take into 
consideration the need to maintain a balanced workforce in which women and members of 
racial and ethnic minority groups are appropriately represented in Government service and 
will adhere to merit system principles. 

5.  Responsibilities.  All responsible parties will ensure fair and consistent application of 
the procedures outlined in this instruction.     

a.  The FEMA Director or a designee shall approve or disapprove payment of 
recruitment and relocation bonuses, payment or recertifications for retention allowances, 
and repayment of student loans.   

b.  Assistant Directors, Administrators, Regional Directors, General Counsel, Inspector 

General, Chief Financial Officer, and Office Directors shall review written recommen-
dations, within their respective area, for payment of incentives or recertifications for 
retention allowances and, if warranted, forward recommendations and concurrences to the 
FEMA Director through the Chief Financial Officer and the Director, Human Resources 
Division. 

c.  Immediate supervisors shall make written recommendations for recruitment and 
relocation bonuses, payment of retention allowances, and student loan repayments and 
review annually each approved retention allowance to determine if it is still warranted.   
They will notify the Human Resources Division of any pending separation or termination of 
an employee currently serving under a service agreement.

d.  The Chief Financial Officer shall certify the availability of funds in support of the  

incentives. 

e.  The Director, Human Resources Division shall determine policy and provide overall  

technical guidance and direction in monitoring and evaluating the process to ensure 
regulatory compliance.  He or she shall review all requests for use of the incentives covered 
in this instruction and provide recommendations to the FEMA Director for approval or 
disapproval.  

6.    Definitions of Terms.  The terms used in this instruction are defined at attachment A.   

7.  Procedures.   

a.  An organization may recommend payment of a recruitment bonus, a relocation  
bonus or a retention allowance of up to 25 percent of basic pay or recommend repayment of 
all or part of any outstanding federally insured student loan or loans previously taken out, 
subject to the maximum limit of $6,000 per calendar year and a total of $40,000 overall per 
employee.  The incentives will be used to recruit or retain highly qualified candidates or 
employees provided there is a determination that, without an incentive, filling the position 
will be difficult. 

       b.   Incentives are funded from a central budget established specifically for payment of 
recruitment and relocation bonuses, retention allowances, and student loan repayments and 
are monitored by the Chief Financial Officer.   

       c.   An incentive will not be authorized if, when added to the employee’s estimated 
aggregate pay compensation, it exceeds the rate payable for level I of the Executive 
Schedule at the end of the calendar year.  The recruitment and relocation bonuses and 
retention allowances are not considered part of base pay for any purpose.   

      d.   The requesting organization, in coordination with the Human Resources Division, 
must determine in writing that, in the absence of such an incentive, difficulty will be 
encountered in either attracting highly qualified candidates or retaining the services of 
highly qualified employees.  The Human Resources Division will provide overall technical 
guidance and supporting recruitment or retention statistics, where available.  

e.  Once it is determined an incentive will be requested, the organization will submit a  

Standard Form (SF) 52, Request for Personnel Action, along with FEMA Form 30-67, 
Request for Incentive Pay, including any supporting documentation, if appropriate, to the 
recommending official identified in paragraph 5b.   Item 1 of the SF-52 will be annotated 
with the appropriate incentive, including the amount of incentive (recruitment bonus, 
relocation bonus, retention allowance, or student loan repayment).  In the case of retention 
allowances, include the not to exceed period (e.g., NTE l year).   The entire package will 
then be forwarded through the Chief Financial Officer, for certification of funds and to the 
Human Resources Division, for review and appropriate action.

 Criteria for Approval and Payment.  

        a.   Recruitment Bonus.   

              (1)   The requesting organization, in coordination with the Human Resources 
Division, must determine in writing that, without such a bonus, filling the position will be 
difficult.  A recruitment bonus may be paid to an individual who is “newly appointed” to 
the Federal Government, including an appointment following a break in service of at least 
90 days.  A recruitment bonus may also be paid to an individual not yet employed who has 
received a written offer of employment and signed the FEMA Form 30-68, Bonus Service 
Agreement.  The following factors will be considered, documented, and approved before 
the individual enters on duty:  

(a)  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for similar positions,  

including indicators such as offer acceptance rates, the proportion of positions filled, and 
the length of time to fill positions;   

(b) Recent turnover in similar positions;  

   (c)  Labor-market factors that may affect the ability to recruit candidates for 

similar positions;  

   (d) Special qualifications needed in the position;  

               (e)  The practicality of using the superior qualifications appointment 

authority alone or in combination with the recruitment bonus.  

(2)   The bonus shall be calculated as a percentage of the employee’s starting  

annual rate of basic pay (excluding locality pay) and paid as a lump sum.  The amount of 
the recruitment bonus should be the minimum amount needed to attract the candidate.  
When determining the amount of the bonus, the factors listed in paragraph 8a(1) will be 
given consideration, to the extent that they apply, along with the following criteria: 

         (a)  The need for the candidate’s services.  How essential is it to hire this 

candidate?  What are the qualifications of this candidate and how difficult will it be to find 
and hire another candidate of equal qualifications?  What would be the impact of not filling 
this position with a high-quality candidate?  

                        (b) The need for the recruitment bonus to attract the candidate.  How large a 
bonus would it take to attract the candidate?  For example, what other salary offers has he 
or she received?  What is the prevailing private sector salary for the occupation?  

         (c)  The Agency’s ability to pay the bonus.  How large a bonus can be 

supported?

b.  Relocation Bonus. 

October 1, 2002

           (1)  A relocation bonus is appropriate when the employee relocates to accept a     
position in a different commuting area. A relocation bonus may NOT be paid until the 
employee establishes a residence in the new commuting area. The employing organization, 
in coordination with the Human Resources Division, must determine in writing that, 
without such a bonus, filling the position will be difficult.  The following factors will be 
considered, documented, and approved before the employee enters on duty in the position 
to which relocated: 

                  (a)  The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for similar positions  
including indicators such as offer acceptance rates, the proportion of positions filled, and 
the length of time to fill positions; 

                  (b)  Recent turnover in similar positions;  

                  (c)  Labor-market factors that may affect the ability to attract candidates for 
similar positions;  

                  (d)  Special qualifications needed in the position. 

            (2)  The bonus shall be calculated as a percentage of the employee’s initial annual  
rate of basic pay (excluding locality pay) for the new position and paid as a lump sum.  The 
amount of the relocation bonus should be the minimum amount needed to attract the 
employee, considering the factors listed in paragraph 8b(1) and the Agency’s ability to pay 
the bonus.   

            (3)  The payment of a relocation bonus has no effect on an employee’s entitlement 
to reimbursement of relocation expenses, if authorized, under the Federal Travel 
Regulation.  An employee may receive authorization for a relocation bonus and not be 
authorized relocation benefits associated with a permanent change of station move. 

c.   Retention Allowance.    

      (1)  A retention allowance may be authorized if an employee is likely to leave the 
Federal service for any reason.  The employee must have received a bona-fide job offer,  
in writing, or must have submitted his or her resignation or retirement paperwork prior to 
authorization.  The allowance may not be authorized to an employee who is likely to leave 
his or her position for employment in the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the 
Federal Government, whether in the same or a different agency.  

           (2)  The employing organization, in coordination with the Human Resources 
Division, must make a written determination that the unusually high or unique 
qualifications of the employee or a special need for the employee’s services makes it 
essential to retain the employee.  The decision must address the extent to which the 
employee’s departure would affect the Agency’s ability to carry out an activity or perform a 
function that is essential to the Agency’s mission.  It should also address the Agency’s

October 1, 2002 

FEMA Instruction 3100.5 

recent efforts to recruit candidates with similar qualifications and the availability of 
candidates in the labor market, as applicable.  

          (3)   A retention allowance shall be calculated as a percentage of the employee’s rate 
of basic pay (excluding locality pay) not to exceed 25 percent.  It is paid at the same time as 
the employee’s regular paycheck.  The amount of the allowance will be based on the 
Agency’s need for the unique qualifications of the employee that make it essential to retain 
their services.  

    (4)   Payment for a retention allowance may not begin during any period of 

employment required by a recruitment bonus or relocation service agreement.  However, a 
relocation bonus may be paid to an employee already receiving a retention allowance.   

          (5)   Retention allowances may be granted in increments not to exceed 1 year and 
may be extended, if warranted.   

                  (a)  The Human Resources Division and the employing organization must 
review each retention allowance annually to determine whether payment is still warranted.  
The allowance may be reduced or terminated for budget considerations or if the conditions 
that warranted the allowance have been reduced or no longer exist (i.e., qualified candidates 
are available to fill the Agency’s special need).  

                  (b)  The employing organization must submit a written statement to the Human 
Resources Division, signed by the recommending official, to continue, reduce or terminate 
the retention allowance.  The statement must include the employee’s name, pay plan, series, 
grade, position title, and duty station; the action being requested (i.e., continue, reduce, or 
terminate); if a reduction, the amount approved; and reason(s) for continuing, reducing or 
terminating the allowance.  In addition, the employing organization must submit a SF-52, 
signed by the approving official.  The entire package must be submitted through the 
Financial and Acquisition Management Division, for certification of funds, to the Human 
Resources Division, for review and appropriate action.  Item 1 of the SF-52 will reflect  
whether the allowance is to be continued, reduced or terminated.  If continued or reduced, 
the percentage must be reflected.           

d.  Student Loan Repayment.   

  (1)  Loan repayments may be made to recruit highly qualified candidates or retain 
highly qualified employees based on a written determination that in the absence of offering 
the benefits, the Agency would encounter difficulty in filling the position with a highly 
qualified candidate or in retaining a highly qualified employee in the position.  This 
incentive may be used in conjunction with the recruitment bonus, the relocation bonus, or 
the retention allowance.  

       (2)  The maximum limit for loan repayment will be $6,000 per calendar year 
and a total of $40,000 overall per employee.  The size of the loan repayment(s) will be 
determined by the candidate’s or employee’s value to the Agency and how far in advance  

6

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
FEMA Instruction 3100.5 

October 1, 2002

funds can be committed.  The criteria in 8d(6)(7), as applicable, will be applied when 
establishing the amount of repayment(s).  The employee will be responsible for making 
loan repayment(s) on the portion of the loan that continues to be his or her responsibility.  
Payments may be applied only to the indebtedness outstanding at the time the Agency and 
the employee enter into an agreement.   

   (3)  Payments will be at the discretion of the Agency and will be subject to the   

terms, limitations, or conditions mutually agreed to in writing by the Agency and employee.  
The employee is responsible for any income tax obligations resulting from the loan 
repayment benefit.  The payments do not have to be in a lump sum.  They can be made at 
periodic intervals throughout the fiscal year.  FEMA will deduct the amount of taxes to be 
withheld from the loan repayment benefit before issuing payment to the holder of the loan.    

   (4)  Before authorizing loan repayments, the Human Resources Division or the 
requesting organization must verify with the holder of the loan that the employee has an 
outstanding student loan that qualifies for repayment under this policy.  The remaining 
balances should be verified to ensure that loans are not overpaid.  The loan repayment 
cannot exceed the limits set forth in paragraph 8d(2).   

   (5)  There are only certain types of loans that qualify as eligible for this incentive.  
The repayment authority is limited to student loans authorized by the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 and the Public Health Service Act.  These are federally insured loans made by 
educational institutions or banks and other private lenders.  

(a)  The Higher Education Act covers three families of guaranteed student 

loans: 

(i)   Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL).   

a.   Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans;  

b.  Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans;  

c.   Federal Plus Loans; and, 

d.  Federal Consolidation Loans. 

(ii)  William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (Direct Loans).   

   a.   Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans; 

   b.  Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans;  

   c.  Direct PLUS Loans; 

     d.  Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loans; and,

(iii)   Federal Perkins Loan Program.  

     a.   National Defense Student Loans (made before July 1, 1972);  

 b.
and July 1, 1987); and,  

   National Direct Student Loans (made between July 1, 1972  

 c.    Perkins Loans (made after July 1, 1987). 

(b) Loans covered under the Public Health Service Act. 

(i)  Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS);  

(ii)  Primary Care Loans (PCL);  

(iii)  Nursing Student Loans (NSL); 

                           (iv)   Health Profession Student Loans (HPSL); and, 

                           (v)    Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL).  

            (6)   When used as a recruitment tool, the following factors will be considered, 
documented, and approved before the individual enters on duty:   

                     (a)  Success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for similar positions, 
including indicators such as offer acceptance rates, the proportion of positions filled, and 
the length of time to fill positions;  

                    (b)  Recent turnover in similar positions;  

(c)  Labor-market factors that may affect the ability to recruit candidates for  

similar positions; 

(d)  Special qualifications needed in the position;  

  (e)  In determining the amount of the repayment, subject to the limits in  

paragraph 8d(2), consideration should be given to factors such as the severity of the 
recruiting efforts, the criticality of the position, and the effect on the Agency’s mission if it 
is not filled or if there is further delay in the filling of the position.  

(7)  When used as a retention tool, the following factors will be considered, 
documented, and approved before the employee is authorized to receive any repayment of a 
federally insured student loan:

October 1, 2002

         (a)  The employee must have received a bona-fide job offer, in writing, or  

have submitted his or her resignation or retirement paperwork prior to authorization. 

      (b)  The employing organization, in coordination with the Human Resources 

Division, must make a written determination that the unusually high or unique 
qualifications of the employee or a special need for the employee’s services makes it 
essential to retain the employee, and that, in the absence of offering the repayment benefit, 
the employee would be likely to leave for employment outside the Federal service.  The 
decision must address the extent to which the employee’s departure would affect the 
Agency’s ability to carry out an activity or perform a function that is essential to the 
Agency’s mission.  It should also address the Agency’s recent efforts to recruit candidates 
with similar qualifications and the availability of candidates in the labor market, as 
applicable.  

                    (c)  The amount of the repayment, subject to the limits in paragraph 8d(2), 
should be based on factors such as the criticality of the loss of the employee to the 
Agency’s mission, the reason(s) that a lesser amount would not be sufficient to retain the 
employee, and any other factor(s) deemed appropriate to retaining the services of the 
employee. 

9.    Service  Agreements.   Before  any  recruitment  or  relocation  bonus  or  student  loan 
repayment  may  be  made,  the  candidate  or  employee  must  sign  a  written  agreement  to 
complete  a  specified  period  of  time  with  FEMA  (use  FEMA  Form  30-68,  Bonus  Service 
Agreement, when authorizing a recruitment or a relocation bonus and FEMA Form 30-69, 
Student Loan Repayment Service Agreement, when authorizing a student loan repayment). 

a.  Recruitment and relocation bonuses of 15 percent or less require the individual  
to sign a 12-month service agreement and a 24-month service agreement if the bonus is 
more than 15 percent.  The period of service begins when the payment is made to the 
candidate or employee.  In the case of a recruitment bonus paid to an individual not yet 
employed who has signed a written service agreement, the period of service begins when 
the individual enters on duty.  An employee who voluntarily terminates employment with 
the organization before fulfilling the period of the service agreement is indebted to the  
government for a pro rata share of the recruitment or relocation bonus.  A pro rata share of 
the bonus shall be recovered as a debt to the Federal Government.  Repayment of the bonus 
is not required when the employee is involuntarily separated for reasons other than 
misconduct or performance.  

       b.   Student loan repayments require a service agreement of 3 years.  The 3-year   
service agreement is established in statute, may not be pro-rated, and begins when the first 
payment is made to the holder of the loan.  An employee who fails to complete the period 
of employment established under the student loan service agreement is indebted to the 
Federal Government and must reimburse the Agency for the entire amount of any student 
loan repayment benefits received.  Repayment of the student loan is not required when the

FEMA Instruction 3100.5 

Government employee under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550, Subpart K, or through the 
appropriate provisions governing debt collection if the individual is no longer a Federal 
employee.  

c.  The employee may request a waiver of repayment for any of the incentives covered  
in this policy through his or her supervisor.  The request must include the employee’s name, 
a copy of the service agreement, and the reason(s) why repayment should be waived.  The 
supervisor will send the request, along with his or her recommendation, through the head of 
the organization and through the Director, Human Resources Division (HRD) for 
concurrence or nonconcurrence.  The Director, HRD, will forward to the FEMA Director 
who will render a written decision.  WAIVERS WILL BE RARE and will be based on a 
determination that recovery would be against equity and good conscience or against the 
public interest.  A copy of the approval or disapproval of the waiver will be provided to the 
Human Resources Division. 

10.  Reporting Requirements.  The Human Resources Division will submit an annual 
report to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the use of these incentives. 

11.  Documentation and Recordkeeping Procedures.  A record of each determination made 
to effect the incentives will be maintained in the Human Resources Division.  At a 
minimum, the documentation will include a copy of the SF-52, FEMA Form 30-67, with 
appropriate supporting documentation, and a copy of the service agreement.  These records 
may be destroyed after 3 years or after OPM formally evaluates the program, whichever 
occurs first.

October 1, 2002 

Attachment A 

Definitions of Terms 

Aggregate Limitation on Pay - means that the employee’s total aggregate pay 
compensation may not exceed the current pay rate of level I of the Executive Schedule in 
any one calendar year.  Therefore, any part of a bonus or allowance that would exceed 
that limit for the current calendar year must be withheld until the next calendar year.  

Basic Pay - is the total amount of pay an employee received during any one calendar year 
at the rate fixed for the position by law or administrative action.  Basic pay does not 
include locality comparability adjustments or additional pay of any other kind and is 
calculated before any deductions. 

Commuting Area - means the geographic area that is normally considered one area for 
employment purposes.  It includes any population center (or neighboring ones) and the 
surrounding localities where people live and reasonably can be expected to travel back 
and forth daily to work. 

Difficult-to-fill Position - there is no specific definition that describes a difficult-to-fill 
position.  However, various factors such as the following can be indicators in determining 
that a position is—or is likely to be—difficult to fill: 

   Success of recent recruiting or retaining efforts; 
   Recent turnover in similar positions; and 
   Labor market factors affecting the Agency’s ability to recruit or retain high-  
     quality candidates.        

High-Quality Candidate - there is no specific definition that describes a high-quality 
candidate.  However, factors such as the following can be considered indicators of high 
quality: 

   Unique or unusually high qualification (education, experience, expertise, etc.); 
   Specialized skills that are scarce in the relevant labor market; and 
   Ability to perform functions that are crucial to the Agency’s mission.  

Involuntary Separation - refers to a separation initiated by the agency against the 
employee’s will and without his/her consent for reasons other than cause on charges of 
misconduct or performance. 

Newly Appointed - means the position is the individual’s first civilian appointment, 
regardless of tenure, in the Federal Government or the individual has worked for the 
Federal government before, but there has been a break in service of at least 90 days.  See 
5 CFR section 575.103 for exceptions to the 90-day break in service. 

A-1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
October 1, 2002 

FEMA Instruction 3100.5 

Pro-rata Share - an amount of a relocation or recruitment bonus requiring repayment 
that is calculated by dividing the total amount of the bonus by the entire service period 
(expressed in months).  The repayment amount will be this result multiplied by the 
remaining full months of the service agreement. 

Recruitment Bonus - is a one-time payment to entice a candidate to accept an agency’s  
offer of employment.  Agencies may pay a recruitment bonus in order to fill a position  
with a high-quality candidate from outside the Federal Government, provided there is a  
determination that, without of such a bonus, the position will be difficult-to-fill. 

Relocation Bonus - is a one-time payment to entice a current Federal employee to accept 
a position in a different commuting area, provided there is a determination that, without 
such a bonus, the position will be difficult-to-fill.    

Retention Allowance - is an ongoing payment over and above basic pay that is paid to  
retain a current Federal employee in his or her present position.  It should be determined  
that the position is difficult to fill and the unusually high qualifications of the employee  
or a special need for the employee’s services makes it essential to retain the employee.   

Service Agreement - is a written agreement between an agency and an employee in 
which the employee agrees to a specified period of employment in return for recruitment 
or relocation bonus or the repayment of a student loan. 

Student Loan Repayment Authority - permits agencies to repay student loans to recruit 
or retain highly qualified individuals in difficult-to-fill positions.  The repayment 
authority is limited to certain federally insured loans (see paragraph 8d(5) of the 
instruction) for a list of specific loans. 

Superior Qualifications Appointment - means an appointment made at a rate above the 
minimum rate of the appropriate general schedule grade because of the superior 
qualifications of the candidate or a special need of the agency for the candidate’s 
services. 

Pay Compensation - means the total of basic pay received; locality-based pay 
adjustments; premium pay; incentive awards and performance-based awards; recruitment 
and relocation bonuses; retention allowances; supervisory differentials under 5 U.S.C. 
5755; post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925; danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 
5928; allowances based on environmental conditions for employees stationed outside of 
the continental United States under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(2); and, continuation of pay under 5 
U.S.C. 8118.

Overview  
These Instructions provide guidance for the administration, implementation, and 
oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Employee Awards 
and Recognition Program (Awards and Recognition Program). FEMA’s Awards and 
Recognition Program recognizes employee performance, achievements, exceptional 
contributions, and service toward meeting Agency goals and improving the efficiency, 
effectiveness, and economy of the government. The Awards and Recognition Program 
supports a climate in FEMA that values employees and facilitates a workplace that 
motivates, excites, encourages, stimulates, and rewards. All employees, including 
supervisors, share the responsibility of rewarding and recognizing achievements and 
contributions. 

These Instructions supersede: 

  FEMA Manual 255-4-1: Employee Awards and Recognition, dated September 

26, 2013. 

  Chapter 6-4: Step Increases, FEMA Manual 255-11-1: Cadre of On-Call 

Response/Recovery Employee (CORE) Program, dated August 25, 2015. 

  Chapter 10-2: Time-Off Awards, FEMA Manual 123-10-1: Absence and Leave, 

dated December 29, 2015. 

  The relevant portions of FEMA Directive 010-7: Incident Management Assistance 
Team (IMAT) Program Directive, dated January 12, 2015, starting in calendar 
year 2018 at which point these Instructions cover IMAT employees. 

Overarching Approach  
Consistent with the following policies from DHS, these instructions outline FEMA's 
criteria for recognizing and rewarding employees: 

  DHS Management Directive (MD) 255-01: Honorary Awards, dated October 31, 

2007.  

  DHS MD 255-01-001: Instruction Guide on Honorary Awards, dated November 6, 

2007.  

  DHS MD 255-02: Employee Recognition, dated October 31, 2007.  

  DHS MD 255-02-001: Instruction Guide on Employee Recognition, dated 

November 6, 2007.  

  DHS Instruction Manual 255-03-001-01: Time-Off Awards, dated March 25, 

2015. 

Supervisors and employees should implement these Instructions in order to determine 
award decisions and follow appropriate protocol for the nomination of awards. 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 1: General Information 
Outcome: FEMA's Awards and Recognition Program is administered consistently and 
fairly for all eligible employees.  

A.  Applicability and Scope  

1.  The Awards and Recognition Program applies to all FEMA employees who meet 

the definition of “employee” under 5 U.S.C. § 2105, including Stafford Act 
employees, except as excluded in paragraph 2 below. However, Cadre of On-
Call Response/Recovery (CORE), and Reservist employees are not eligible for 
all award types as detailed in these Instructions, and Senior Executive Service 
(SES) employees are only eligible for the Administrator’s Award and honorary 
awards. 

2.  In addition to the restrictions set forth in 5 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) § 

451.105, the Awards and Recognition Program does not apply to:  

a.  Members of the uniformed military services in their official military capacity 

except for cash or monetary awards for suggestions, inventions, and scientific 
achievements as provided for under 10 U.S.C. § 1124. 

b.  Private citizens and organizations (including FEMA contractors). 

c.  Employees paid from non-appropriated funds.  

d.  Schedule C employees, except in limited circumstances. (Contact the Office 
of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO) for additional 
guidance). 

3.  Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 451.104, awards for contributions made by an individual 
when employed by FEMA may be paid to a former employee or the estate or 
legal heirs of a deceased employee. Awards to separated or deceased military 
members for contributions made while the member was on active duty may be 
paid to the former member or to the member’s estate or legal heirs. 

B.  FEMA Awards Program Basics 

1.  FEMA is committed to maintaining a highly skilled workforce to guarantee quality 
service to the public. The Awards and Recognition Program is designed to create 
an environment where employees actively and continually seek exceptional ways 
to do their jobs, improve organizational performance, and take great pride in their 
achievements. The Awards and Recognition Program recognizes employees’ 
accomplishments, contributions, and innovations in support of the Agency's 
vision, mission, and goals. 

2.  All award nominations under this Awards and Recognition Program must 

demonstrate that the accomplishment has contributed to and is aligned with 
FEMA's goals. 

3.  FEMA Form 255-4-1-1: Award Nomination must be used for all awards 

nominations. 

2 

 
 
 
 
4.  Award justifications must describe the employee's specific accomplishment or 
contribution, explain why it warrants recognition, describe the tangible and/or 
intangible benefits, and provide the rationale for the recommended award 
amount.  

5.  Employees who have received, or are in the process of receiving, a written 

disciplinary or adverse action during the past 52 weeks are ineligible for awards 
and recognition other than Length of Service Awards. 

6.  Awards may not be used:  

a.  To recognize an employee for performing additional duties during or as a 

result of a temporary promotion;  

b.  To compensate an employee for perceived discrepancies or inadequacies in 

the pay system; or  

c.  As a farewell gift. 

C.  General Awards Rules 

1.  Cash or monetary awards are not considered a part of an employee’s basic pay. 

2.  Cash or monetary awards greater than $6,000 must be approved by the DHS 

Deputy Secretary. 

3.  An honorary award does not consist of cash. 

D.  Cash or Monetary Awards 

1.  Cash awards recognize exceptional performance by an individual or group in 
support of the Agency's goals. Cash awards are special acts, on-the-spot, or 
performance-based awards. Eligible FEMA employees may receive a special act 
or on-the-spot award in combination with a time-off award (TOA) at the discretion 
of the Office or Directorate. 

2.  Only one cash award may be granted for each achievement or contribution. 

However, employees may receive both a cash and honorary award for the same 
contribution.  

3.  Employees may receive more than one cash award in a fiscal year, but an award 
may not exceed the dollar limits set by the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM), DHS, or the FEMA Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or designee.  
See the Annual Awards Guidance for more information. 

4.  All cash awards must be documented by a Standard Form (SF) 50: Notification of 

Personnel Action and a written justification.  

E.  Honorary or Non-Monetary Awards 

1.  Honorary awards are intended immediately to recognize employees for 

contributing to mission and strategic goals. An honorary award may be presented 
at any level of the Agency in recognition of exceptional efforts and contributions 
made by employee(s) or group(s). All employee types are eligible for honorary 
awards.  

3 

 
 
 
2.  Each Program Head (Office or Directorate) is responsible for developing an 

honorary awards program at appropriate levels. Each organization’s honorary 
awards program procedures must be submitted to OCCHCO for assessment and 
approval prior to implementation.  

3.  Recognition items for honorary awards must not be funded from the cash award 

allocation. Program areas must budget for funding their honorary awards 
program recognition items with program funds. Recipients may receive 
recognition items such as a letter, certificate, pin, plaque with citation, or other 
items of nominal value not to exceed $20.  

4.  Receipt of a FEMA honorary award does not preclude award of a DHS honorary 

award recognizing the same act or contribution.

a single company. If the item is branded, then DHS Branding Guidance must 
be followed.  

2.  All employees are eligible to receive recognition items. 

3.  Honorary awards may or may not be accompanied by a recognition item. For

4.  OCCHCO will determine those employees who meet the length of service 

requirement for career service recognition. 

C.  On-the-Spot Awards 

1.  Overview 

a.  On-the-Spot (OTS) awards are cash awards and provide immediate 

recognition for a worthy non-recurring contribution, specific act, or service in 
the public interest and exceeding normal job requirements.  

b.  OTS award contributions may include: 

i.  Making a high quality contribution involving a difficult or important issue, 

project, or assignment. 

ii.  Displaying special initiative and skill in completing an assignment or 

project before the deadline.  

iii.  Using initiative and creativity to improve a product, activity, program, or 

service.  

iv.  Ensuring an Office or Directorate’s mission is accomplished during a 
difficult period by successfully completing additional work or a project

D.  Performance-Based Awards 

1.  Overview 

a.  Performance-based awards are lump-sum cash awards or TOAs designed to 
recognize employees for the accomplishment of duties based on merit at the 
end of the performance cycle. Performance-based cash awards are granted 
based on the employee’s rating of record. 

b.  Performance-based awards may not exceed 10% of the employee’s annual 
rate of basic pay unless the FEMA Administrator or Deputy Administrator, 
with the approval of the DHS Deputy Secretary, determines that exceptional 
performance by an employee justifies a larger percentage not to exceed 20% 
of the employee’s annual rate of basic pay. Notwithstanding these percentage 
caps, the DHS Deputy Secretary must approve cash or monetary awards 
greater than $6,000 per employee up to and including $10,000, the Director of 
OPM must approve cash or monetary awards over $10,000 but under 
$25,000, and the President of the United States must approve awards of 
$25,000 or more.  

c.  In accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 451.104(g), when granting an award as a 
percentage of basic pay, the rate of basic pay used must include any 
applicable locality payment or special rate supplement. 

d.  Offices or Directorates will reserve at least 60% of their annual awards budget 

to be used for performance-based awards.  

e.  A performance-based award may not be combined with another award. 

2.  Employee Preference 

a.  Supervisors may not give their eligible employees a choice between a specific 

cash or equivalent TOA. 

b.  However, management may ask all eligible employees whether they would 
prefer either a cash or TOA before deciding whether to grant an award. 
Management may not provide or imply a guarantee of a performance-based 
award type or amount. 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Eligibility 

a.  All employees except SES employees are eligible for performance-based 

awards. However, Reservists are only eligible for a cash award and not time-
off.  

b.  Employees must have: 

i.  A signed performance plan for a minimum of 90 days (or have at least one 

deployment evaluation for Reservists); 

ii.  Supporting progress review(s) (or deployment evaluation(s) for 

Reservists); and 

iii.  A rating of record of “exceeded expectations” for the last performance 

cycle. 

4.  Nomination 

A performance-based award nomination may only be made by an employee's 
supervisor of record using FEMA Form 255-4-1-1: Award Nomination and based 
on the current performance appraisal (rating of record). The supervisor of record 
will verify the current performance appraisal for eligibility, complete a FEMA Form 
255-4-1-1: Award Nomination, and forward the nomination to the employee’s 
second-level supervisor for review and approval via the approved process. 

5.  Approval 

a.  The second-level supervisor and the Program Head (Office or Directorate) 

must approve performance-based awards.  

b.  The Office or Directorate will submit the award nomination via the approved 

process. 

c.  All approved nomination forms must be forwarded to OCCHCO for processing 

and recordkeeping 

E.  Quality Step Increase 

1.  Overview 

a.  A Program Head (Office or Directorate) may grant a Quality Step Increase 

(QSI) in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily found in 
the type of position concerned. It provides an incentive to the employee and 
recognizes unusually high quality performance by granting an earlier than 
normal step increase. However, an employee who receives a QSI is eligible 
for only one additional step increase within any 52-week period. 

b.  A QSI is not an equivalent increase under 5 C.F.R. § 531.407 and will not 

start a new waiting period for the next within-grade increase. However, receipt 
of a QSI may delay the next regular within-grade increase. When receipt of a 
QSI moves an employee to the fourth or seventh step of a grade, the waiting 
period for a regular within-grade increase is extended by 52 weeks from the 
effective date of the QSI under the graduated waiting-period schedule 
prescribed by 5 U.S.C. § 5335(a). When receipt of a QSI moves an employee 

10 

 
 
 
to the eighth or ninth step of a grade, the waiting period for a regular within-
grade increase is not extended. 

c.  Offices or Directorates are responsible to ensure all QSIs are sustainable 
within their published salaries and benefits targets for the fiscal year of 
execution and two fiscal years thereafter. 

2.  Eligibility 

a.  All full-time General Schedule (GS) or FWS employees in the GS pay plan 

below step 10 in their grade level are eligible for a QSI.  Stafford Act 
employees are not eligible for a QSI. 

b.  The employee’s most recent rating of record must be at level 5 (“achieved 

excellence”). 

c.  The employee may not receive more than one QSI in any 52-week period. 

3.  Nomination 

a.  A QSI nomination may only be made by an employee's supervisor of record. 

The employee's second-level supervisor and Program Head (Office or 
Directorate) must concur with the nomination. 

b.  Nominations for QSIs must be submitted within 30 days of approval of the 
ratings of record. Each nomination must include appropriate justification for 
the QSI using FEMA Form 255-4-1-1: Award Nomination based on the rating 
of record, and be submitted via the approved process.  

4.  Approval 

a.  The employee's second-level supervisor and Program Head (Office or 

Directorate) must approve the QSI nomination. 

b.  All approved nomination forms must be forwarded to OCCHCO for processing 

and recordkeeping 

F.  CORE Step Increase 

1.  Overview 

a.  A Program Head (Office or Directorate) may grant a CORE Step Increase 

(CSI) in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily found in 
the type of position concerned. It provides an incentive to the employee and 
recognizes unusually high quality performance by granting an earlier than 
normal step increase. However, an employee who receives a CSI is eligible 
for only one additional step increase within any 52-week period. 

b.  A CSI is not an equivalent increase under 5 C.F.R. § 531.407 and will not 

start a new waiting period for the next within-grade increase. However, receipt 
of a CSI may delay the next regular within-grade increase. When receipt of a 
CSI moves an employee to the fourth or seventh step of a grade, the waiting 
period for a regular within-grade increase is extended by 52 weeks from the 
effective date of the CSI under the graduated waiting-period schedule 
prescribed by 5 U.S.C. § 5335(a). When receipt of a CSI moves an employee 

11 

 
 
 
to the eighth or ninth step of a grade, the waiting period for a regular within-
grade increase is not extended. 

c.  Offices or Directorates are responsible to ensure all CSIs are sustainable 
within their published salaries and benefits targets for the fiscal year of 
execution and two fiscal years thereafter. 

2.  Eligibility 

a.  Prior to the completion of the requisite waiting period, a supervisor may 

recommend one additional step increase per year if warranted by the CORE’s 
performance. 

b.  All COREs paid via the IC pay plan are eligible for a CSI.  GS and FWS 

employees are not eligible for a CSI. 

c.  To be eligible for a CSI, a CORE must have “achieved excellence” on their 

most recent annual performance evaluation.  

3.  Nomination 

a.  A CSI nomination may only be made by a CORE employee's supervisor of 

record. 

b.  Nominations should be prepared as soon as possible following the 

contribution to ensure timely recognition, generally within 90 days of approval 
of the rating of record. Each nomination must include appropriate justification 
for the CSI using FEMA Form 255-4-1-1: Award Nomination based on the 
rating of record, and be submitted via the approved process provided in the 
annual awards guidance. 

4.  Approval 

a.  The employee's second-level supervisor and Program Head (Office or 

Directorate) must approve the CSI nomination. 

b.  All approved nomination forms must be forwarded to OCCHCO for processing 

and recordkeeping

H.  Time-Off Awards  

1.  Overview 

a.  A TOA is an excused absence granted to an employee to be used without 

charge to leave or loss of pay in recognition of individual or group 
contributions or accomplishments. Contributions that may be recognized with 
a TOA include: 

i.  Making a high quality contribution involving a difficult or important issue, 

project, or assignment.  

ii.  Displaying special initiative and skill in completing an assignment or 

project before the deadline.  

iii.  Using initiative and creativity to improve a product, activity, program, or 

service.  

iv.  Ensuring an Office or Directorate’s mission is accomplished during a 
difficult period by successfully completing additional work or a project 
assignment while maintaining the employee’s own workload.  

b.  Full-time employees may be granted up to 80 hours of time-off during a leave 

year, but not more than 40 hours for a single contribution.  

c.  Part-time employees may be granted time-off up to the average number of 

work hours in the employee’s biweekly scheduled tour of duty during a leave 
year. The limit for any single contribution for part-time employees is one-half 
the maximum that may be granted during the leave year.  

d.  TOAs will be granted and used in 15-minute increments.  

e.  Though TOAs may not have an immediate budget consequence, supervisors 
must fully consider wage costs and productivity loss when granting TOAs and 
must ensure that the amount of time-off granted as an award is 
commensurate with the employee’s contribution or accomplishment. 
Supervisors must follow the Annual Awards Guidance for tracking/reporting 
awards. 

f.  TOAs must be scheduled and used within 26 pay periods from the effective 
date of processing. After the 26th pay period, any unused time-off will be 
automatically forfeited. 

g.  TOAs have no effect on annual leave carryover limitations. If an employee is 
scheduled to use a TOA and is unable to use it at that time, the employee 
may reschedule the TOA for another time, within the 26 pay period limitation.  

h.  Under 5 C.F.R. § 451.104(f), a TOA must not be converted to cash under any 

circumstances.  

i. 

If an employee separates from DHS before using all time-off hours then the 
employee forfeits any unused time-off. If forfeited, no other award or 
compensation may be substituted.  

14 

 
 
 
j. 

If an employee transfers to or from another DHS Component, the TOA will be 
transferred to the gaining DHS Component. 

k.  If an employee transfers to or from a federal agency outside of DHS, the TOA 
will be forfeited, and no other award or compensation may be substituted.  

l.  TOAs must not be granted to create the effect of a holiday or treated as 

administrative excusals or leave, i.e. granting the entire organization or office 
a TOA to be used on a specified day. 

2.  Eligibility 

All employees except SES and Reservist employees are eligible for TOAs. 

3.  Nomination 

a.  Any FEMA employee may informally make a nomination for a TOA by 

submitting a written justification to the nominated employee’s supervisor. 

b.  The employee’s supervisor of record will prepare a TOA nomination as soon 
as possible following the contribution or accomplishment to ensure timely 
recognition. The supervisor prepares FEMA Form 255-4-1-1: Award 
Nomination, including a written justification describing the basis for the award.  

c.  The employee’s supervisor of record must recommend an award amount 

based on the significance of the contribution using Appendix B – Guidelines 
for Award Amounts for Special Acts and Time-Off. The amount of time-off 
granted must be proportionate to the value of the contribution being 
recognized.  

4.  Approval 

a.  A written justification is required to document all TOAs. The supervisor of 
record may approve a TOA of one day or less. If the award exceeds nine 
hours, it must be reviewed and approved by the Program Head (Office or 
Directorate). 

b.  A TOA may be granted along with other forms of awards, with the exception 
of performance-based, as long as the total value of the awards given reflects 
the value of the contribution being recognized. For example, an employee 
might receive both a one-day TOA and a $100 special act or on-the-spot 
award as an award for a single contribution, as long as the combination of the 
awards does not exceed the value of the employee’s contribution based on 
Appendix B – Guidelines for Award Amounts for Special Acts and Time-Off. 
c.  The Office or Directorate will submit the award nomination via the approved 

process provided in the annual awards guidance. 

d.  OCCHCO will process the TOA in accordance with the OPM Guide to 

Processing Personnel Actions and issue the employee an SF-50: Notification 
of Personnel Action. A TOA may only be taken after it has been entered in the 
payroll/personnel system and is available in the National Finance Center’s 
database. 

15 

 
 
 
e.  All approved nomination forms must be forwarded to OCCHCO for processing 

and recordkeeping. 

I.  Candidate Referral Bonus Program  

1.  Overview 

a.  FEMA may augment its recruiting efforts by authorizing cash referral bonuses 
for employees who help FEMA identify candidates for hard-to-fill positions as 
determined by OCCHCO. The Associate Administrator, Mission Support, 
must determine whether positions within OCCHCO are hard-to-fill. 

b.  The Program Head (Office or Directorate) will submit a request to OCCHCO 
to include positions in the Candidate Referral Bonus Program. The request 
must include: 

i.  A list of positions requested to be included in the Candidate Referral 

Bonus Program; 

ii.  The factor(s) and supporting information to designate a position as hard-

to-fill; 

iii.  A time period for when referral bonuses may be paid; and 

iv.  The number of positions to be filled, or the number of referral bonuses that 

may be paid through this program. 

c.  Mission Support must consider the following factors when designating a 

position as hard-to-fill: 

i.  The lack of success of recent efforts to recruit candidates and retain 

employees in like positions; 

ii.  The availability in the labor market of highly qualified candidates; 

iii.  Recent turnover in similar positions; 

iv.  Special qualifications needed for the position; 

v.  Inability to meet or keep a sufficient Reservist force structure; and 

vi.  Any other unique factor that demonstrates difficulty in filling the position. 

d.  Referral bonuses may only be paid after OCCHCO verifies that the 

appropriate monies have been appropriated and allocated for such purpose. 

e.  OCCHCO will maintain a list of positions that are included in the Candidate 

Referral Program. 

f.  Eligible employees may receive a $100 referral bonus per referral, up to a 

maximum of ten referral bonuses per calendar year. 

g.  Referral bonuses will be paid in one lump-sum payment after a prospective 
employee is successfully on-boarded for a period of at least 90 days.  

h.  A referral bonus will only be granted once per hired candidate upon his or her 
initial appointment to FEMA. The referred candidate must identify the FEMA 
employee who referred him/her to FEMA. Only one employee may receive a 

16 

 
 
 
referral bonus per newly on-boarded candidate. Multiple referral bonuses will 
not be awarded for the same successfully on-boarded candidate. 

i.  Once an employee refers a candidate through the Candidate Referral Bonus 
Program, the employee may not advocate for the candidate’s appointment to 
anyone involved in the rating or selection of employees for the position. 

j.  The designation of hard-to-fill positions and the selection of candidates will be 
made without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and 
gender identity), national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital 
status, disability, genetic information, age, labor organization affiliation or non-
affiliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. 

2.  Eligibility

b.  All employees are eligible to receive a referral bonus, except for the following 

restrictions: 

i.  Employees whose regular, recurring jobs include recruitment of new 
employees; employees who are involved, in any way, in the rating or 
selection of the referred candidate; or employees who refer a relative1 are 
ineligible for a referral bonus.  

ii.  During a Presidential election period,2 non-career SES members, 

Schedule C employees, and employees appointed by the President with 
Senate confirmation3 are ineligible to receive a referral bonus. 

3.  To apply for a referral bonus, eligible current employees must complete and send 
FEMA Form 255-4-1-2: Candidate Referral Bonus Form (available on the FEMA 
intranet) to the OCCHCO Talent Acquisition Division. 

4.  OCCHCO will review applications for a referral bonus, ensuring that the position 

is included in the program, and that the candidate identifies the referring 
employee prior to approving a referral bonus.

popular election of the President occurs, and ending on January 20 following the date of such election (5 
U.S.C. § 4508). 
3 In order to be ineligible for this referral bonus, the employee appointed by the President with Senate

FEMA DIRECTIVE: FEMA Employee 
Resource Groups  
FEMA Directive #112-10 

BACKGROUND  
This Directive is applicable to all Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees. 
This Directive does not supersede any other FEMA policy or directives. 

PURPOSE  

To establish FEMA standards, procedures, and responsibilities for non-union, voluntary employee 
organizations known as FEMA Employee Resource Groups (FERGs). 

PRINCIPLES  
A.  FEMA is committed to maintaining a workforce that reflects our Nation’s rich diversity and 

capitalizes on the varied cultural, professional, and ethnic backgrounds of our workforce and 
those we serve. FEMA encourages staff participation in FERGs to ensure representation of 
diverse perspectives in executing FEMA’s mission. 

B.  FERGs are a valuable mechanism to foster innovation, offer employees access to leadership 

opportunities, establish programs and activities aligned with FEMA’s mission, provide 
employees with development opportunities, and provide managers with innovative solutions to 
enhance diversity.

Page 15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6.  Serve as a point of contact for supervisors, managers, and employees seeking to 

support the group’s employees. 

7.  Serve as a resource to the agency for improving disaster services to the group’s 

survivor population.  

X. 

Meetings and Communication 

Led by their Co-chairs, group members may decide the frequency of their formal meetings, 
calls or other communications, with a minimum of once per quarter. Since group membership 
extends beyond organizational groupings or regional proximity, a majority of the group 
communication will occur virtually. Employees may represent themselves as individuals while 
engaging in group communication. Only those officially authorized will speak on behalf of the 
agency in an official capacity. The FERG will operate virtually through venues such as 
Facebook groups, conference calls, webinars, group emails, and Intranet.  

In locations where the workforce is sufficiently large, the FERG members will be encouraged to 
host localized events or meetings. The frequency and type of gatherings will be determined by 
the members in consultation with the respective SES sponsor, National Co-Sponsors, and the 
Steering Committee. 

XI. 

Reporting 

Upon request by OCCHCO, OER, the DMAC, or any FEMA governing body the group’s SES 
sponsor, National Co-Sponsors, and/or the Steering Committee Co-chairs will be required to 
provide reports and periodic reviews of group activity, communication, or conduct. Proper 
notice and a desired focus for the report and review will be provided.

Foreword 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is committed to providing a work 
environment that is conducive to the successful accomplishment of FEMA’s mission, 
goals, and objectives, while providing for family-friendly work arrangements to the 
greatest extent possible.  While responding to emergencies and disasters nationwide 
frequently requires the undivided attention and personal sacrifice of employees, we 
must support our families in every possible way so they can support us when we need 
to help others.  The effective use of flexible work schedules, as well as overtime work 
and compensatory time, supports this endeavor.  FEMA Instruction 106-1-1, Scheduling 
of Work, outlines the policy and provides guidance for the Agency in promoting a 
flexible and effective workforce.

  Policy 

Program Heads of FEMA organizations are delegated authority to determine 
appropriate work schedules, in accordance with this Instruction and applicable 
law, to implement within their respective work units.  FEMA organizations may 
establish written procedures consistent with this Instruction and in coordination 
with the Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer.  To the extent 
FEMA organizations require a schedule that deviates from the schedules outlined 
in this Instruction, they must coordinate with the Office of the Chief Component 
Human Capital Officer and the Office of Chief Counsel to ensure compliance with 
applicable law.  

  Definitions 

A.  Administrative dismissal.  An order issued by an authorized official relieving 

employees from duty without charge to leave or loss of pay.     

B.  Administrative workweek.  Any period of seven consecutive 24-hour periods 
designated in advance.  At FEMA the administrative workweek is Sunday 
through Saturday. 

C.  Alternative work schedules (AWS).  FEMA policy supports the use of both 

flexible work schedules and compressed work schedules. 

D.  Bargaining unit employee.  A member of a group of employees with common 

interests who are represented by a labor union. 

E.  Basic workweek.  For full-time employees, it is generally a 40-hour workweek, 
Monday through Friday, that does not extend more than six of any seven 
consecutive days.  For part-time employees, it is generally a set number of 
hours between 16 and 32 that does not extend beyond six consecutive days.  
5 C.F.R. §§ 610.102 and 610.111.     

5 

 
F.  Basic work requirement.  The number of hours, excluding overtime hours, an 
employee is required to work or otherwise account for by approved leave.  5 
U.S.C. § 6121(3).   

G.  Biweekly pay period.  The pay period for an employee covers two 

administrative work weeks.  5 U.S.C. § 5504(a). 

H.  Business hours.  Office hours of operation for a FEMA fixed facility 

established by the head of that facility.  For example, at FEMA Headquarters, 
business hours are 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.  Employees on a traditional work 
schedule generally work the business hours.   

I.  Compressed work schedule (CWS).  A work schedule established with 

approval by the employee’s supervisor that: 

1.  For a full-time employee, has an 80-hour biweekly basic work requirement 

scheduled for fewer than 10 workdays.   

2.  For a part-time employee, has a biweekly basic work requirement of 64 

hours or less scheduled for fewer than 10 workdays. 

J.  Core hours.  The designated hours during the workday, work week, or pay 

period that are within the tour of duty during which an employee covered by a 
flexible work schedule is required to be present for work.  FEMA’s core hours 
are between 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. (local time).  5 U.S.C § 6122(a).   

K.  Credit hours.  Those hours within a flexible work schedule, approved in 
advance, that an employee works in excess of his or her basic work 
requirement so as to vary the length of a workweek or workday.  5 U.S.C. § 
6121(4).  An employee on a CWS or a traditional work schedule shall not 
earn credit hours. 

L.  Flexible time band.  The hours before and after core hours on a flexible work 
schedule during which employees may choose their arrival and departure 
times and earn credit hours.  FEMA’s flexible time bands are 6:00 - 9:30 a.m. 
and 3:30 - 8:00 p.m. (local time).  5 U.S.C. § 6122(a)(2). 

M.  Flexible work schedule (FWS).  A work schedule established with approval by 

the employee’s supervisor that: 

1.  In the case of a full-time employee, has an 80-hour biweekly basic work 

requirement that allows an employee to determine his or her own 
schedule within the limits set by FEMA’s business and core hours. 

2.  In the case of a part-time employee, has a biweekly basic work 

requirement of 64 hours or less that allows an employee to determine his 
or her own schedule within the limits set by FEMA’s business and core 
hours. 

N.  Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempt employee.  An employee who is not 
covered by the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA.  See 29 
U.S.C. § 213; 5 C.F.R. § 551.202.  Several categories of employees are 
exempt from the FLSA.  Although OCCHCO ultimately determines which 

6 

 
employees are not covered by the FLSA, these exemptions generally apply to 
employees with managerial responsibilities, positions requiring specialized 
knowledge in areas such as science or law, or positions requiring 
independent judgment. 

O.  FLSA nonexempt employee.  An employee who is covered by the minimum 

wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA.  See 29 U.S.C. § 213; 5 C.F.R. § 
551.202. The FLSA applies to individuals employed by the United States 
Government and governs compensation and work schedules unless the 
employee is determined to be exempt. 

P.  Irregular or occasional overtime.  Overtime that is approved after the 
beginning of the administrative workweek in which it is performed.  

Q.  Lunch or meal break period.  Work schedules of employees required to work 
more than five hours per workday must include a 30-minute unpaid lunch or 
meal break period.  A FEMA organization or work unit may modify this 
requirement to meet operational needs.  This unpaid lunch or meal break 
period may be extended to a maximum of one hour provided the workday is 
correspondingly extended.  Lunch or meal break periods may not be 
scheduled at the beginning or end of the workday.  Because employees 
receive no compensation for lunch or meal break periods, they must be 
entirely free of the duties of their positions during this period.  An employee 
may not work through the lunch or meal break period in order to extend paid 
time or to otherwise modify his or her established schedule.    

R.  Organization.  FEMA program offices, directorates, etc., whose leadership 
reports directly to the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or Regional 
Administrator.   

S.  Overtime hours.  See FEMA Manual 253-2-1, Premium Pay. 

1.  With respect to traditional work schedules: 

a.  For FLSA exempt employees, overtime hours are all hours worked in 
excess of eight hours per day or 40 hours per week that are officially 
ordered and approved in advance by their supervisor. 

b.  For FLSA nonexempt employees, overtime hours are all hours worked 

in excess of eight hours per day or 40 hours per week that the 
supervisor has reason to believe are being performed and fails to 
prevent.    

2.  With respect to FWS programs, overtime hours are hours worked in 

excess of the employee’s tour of duty officially ordered in advance, but do 
not include credit hours.   

3.  With respect to CWS programs, overtime hours are hours worked in 

excess of those hours which constitute the CWS.    

T.  Program Head. A management official such as an Associate Administrator, 

Assistant Administrator, Regional Administrator, and/or Office Chief. 

7 

 
U.  Regularly scheduled administrative workweek.  The period an employee is 

regularly scheduled to work within an administrative workweek (i.e., a period 
of seven consecutive 24-hour periods designated in advance).       

V.  Regularly scheduled overtime.  Overtime that is approved in advance of the 

employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.   

W. Tour of duty.  The hours of a day (a daily tour of duty) and the days of an 

administrative workweek (a weekly tour of duty) that constitute an employee’s 
regularly scheduled administrative workweek.   5 C.F.R. § 610.102.   

X.  Traditional work schedules (TWS).  The basic workweek, in the absence of an 

AWS, during which employees are required to be on duty within the 
administrative workweek.  Generally, the work schedule for employees on a 
TWS coincides with the business hours of the facility.     

Y.  Work unit.  An entity within a FEMA organization with a specific function, 
homogeneous procedures or technology, and headed by a supervisor 
authorized to approve employees’ time and attendance reports and leave 
requests.

TRADITIONAL WORK SCHEDULES 

  General 

This chapter contains procedures and requirements for and associated with 
TWS.  Unless an AWS has been established by the organization or work unit, the 
default schedule for FEMA employees is a TWS.  

  Requirements 

A.  TWS have a basic work week (typically five consecutive days Monday 

through Friday, but may be six of any seven consecutive days) during which 
employees are required to be on duty within the administrative workweek 
(Sunday through Saturday). 

B.  TWS workdays consist of:  

1.  For full-time employees, eight hours per day, 40 hours per week; and    

2.  For part-time employees, between 16 and 32 hours per week and, eight or 

fewer hours per day on five or fewer days per week.   

C.  Generally, full-time employees on TWS are required to perform work during 

the business hours of the FEMA facility to which they are assigned.  Business 
hours include a 30-minute unpaid lunch or meal break period during which 
employees are not permitted to perform work.  To meet operational needs, 
employees on TWS may be required to work outside the facility’s business 
hours.   

D.  Part-time employees on TWS are required to perform work during the 

business hours of the FEMA work unit (at the location) to which they are 
assigned, including a 30-minute unpaid lunch or meal break period if working 
more than five consecutive hours.  

E.  Employees on TWS must work their scheduled work hours or otherwise 

account for their time by using approved leave. 

  Credit Hours 

Employees on TWS may not earn credit hours. 

  Premium Pay  

See FEMA Manual 253-2-1, Premium Pay.

FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES 

  General 

This chapter contains procedures and requirements for and associated with 
FWS.  Program Heads of FEMA organizations and work units may establish 
additional procedures and requirements consistent with this Instruction.  

  Requirements 

A.  FWS consist of a basic workweek (usually five consecutive days Monday 

through Friday) during which employees are required to be on duty within the 
administrative workweek (Sunday through Saturday).  FWS workdays have 
core hours and flexible hours.  

B.  Core hours are the designated period of the day the employee must be 

present at work.  FEMA’s designated core hours are 9:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. 
(local time). 

C.  Flexible hours are those hours worked within two “flexible time bands” on 

either side of the core hours.  Employees on FWS must choose their tour of 
duty within these flexible time bands, but they must be present during the 
core hours.  Depending on the FWS, an employee’s arrival time may be 
limited because the employee must be present during the core hours.        

1.  The AM flexible time band is 6:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m., Monday through 

Friday, unless changed temporarily by the head of a FEMA organization or 
work unit for a specified purpose.   

2.  The PM flexible time band is 3:30 p.m. – 8:00 p.m., Monday through 

Friday, unless changed temporarily the head of a FEMA organization or 
work unit for a specified purpose.  

D.  Supervisors must approve work schedules using FEMA Form 106-1-1-1, 

Request for Work Schedule. 

E.  Program Heads of FEMA organizations may authorize, with OCCHCO 
approval, different core hours and flexible time bands for a specific 
organization or work unit to meet organizational needs. 

F.  Employees under a FWS may earn up to two credit hours per day between 

the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. subject to supervisory approval.  See Section 
3-5 on Credit Hours. 

G.  During core hours, employees must be working or otherwise account for their 

time by using approved leave. 

  FWS Available to FEMA Organizations 

A.  The establishment or termination of a FWS in a work unit in which there are 
bargaining unit employees is subject to the terms of the collective bargaining 
agreement.  See 5 U.S.C. § 6130(a).  

B.  FEMA organizations or specific work units without bargaining unit employees 

may offer the following FWS to their employees:  

12 

 
C.  Flexitour is a FWS in which a full-time employee has a basic work 

requirement of eight hours in each day and 40 hours in each week and 
selects arrival and departure times within the flexible time bands subject to 
supervisory approval.   

D.  Maxiflex is a FWS that contains core hours on fewer than 10 workdays in the 
biweekly pay period.  The employee may vary the number of hours worked on 
a given workday or the number of hours each week within the limits 
established by the organization or work unit.  In FEMA, the maximum number 
of work hours permitted in a daily tour of duty is 11.5 hours. 

  Requesting a FWS 

Employees may request to voluntarily participate in any FWS offered within their 
organization or work unit.  Employees requesting a FWS must: 

1.  Prepare a written request by completing FEMA Form 106-1-1, Request for 

Work Schedule and forward it to their supervisor for approval; and 

2.  Work during the approved work period or otherwise account for their time 

by using approved leave. 

  Credit Hours 

A.  Credit hours are any hours within a FWS that are in excess of an employee's 
basic work requirement (e.g., 40 hours a week), that the employee elects to 
work to vary the length of a workweek or a workday.   

B.  Supervisors must approve the earning and use of credit hours in advance. 

C.  Employees on a FWS may earn credit hours when work is available in excess 
of their normal duty hours.  Credit hours are voluntary and employee-initiated, 
whereas overtime hours are ordered and management-initiated.   

D.  Credit hours do not constitute overtime work and may not be converted to 
overtime or compensatory time or otherwise entitle employees to premium 
pay.   

  Limitations on Earning Credit Hours 

A.  Credit hours may be earned only between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 

p.m., Monday through Friday.  

B.  Credit hours may be earned in quarter-hour increments, up to a maximum of 

two hours per day and 24 hours per pay period.   

C.  Supervisors may limit or restrict the earning and use of credit hours.  

Supervisors may not advance credit hours, that is, time cannot be charged 
against credit hours until credit hours have been earned.   

D.  Credit hours may not be earned during periods of travel or training.  See 5 

U.S.C. § 6121(4) and OPM Fact Sheet:  Credit Hours under a Flexible Work 
Schedule. 

E.  A full-time employee may not carry more than 24 credit hours to the next pay 

period.   

13 

 
F.  A part-time employee may not carry more than one fourth of the hours in his 
or her biweekly schedule to the next pay period.  5 U.S.C. § 6126(a).  For 
example, a part-time employee whose schedule requires the employee to 
work 50 hours per pay period may not carry more than 12.5 credit hours to 
the next pay period. 

G.  OPM regulations prohibit Senior Executive Service (SES) members from

COMPRESSED WORK SCHEDULES 

  General 

This chapter contains procedures and requirements for and associated with 
CWS.  Program Heads of organizations or work units may establish additional 
procedures and requirements consistent with this Instruction. 

  Requirements 

A.  A CWS is a fixed schedule that consists of an 80 hour biweekly basic work 

requirement scheduled for fewer than 10 workdays.   

1.  A full-time employee is required to work 80 hours in a biweekly pay period.  
This work must be scheduled for fewer than 10 days in a biweekly pay 
period. 5 U.S.C. § 6121(5)(A).  

2.  A part-time employee works 64 hours or fewer in a biweekly pay period.  
This work must be scheduled for fewer than 10 workdays in a biweekly 
pay period.  5 U.S.C. § 6121(5)(B).  

B.  The establishment or termination of a CWS in a work unit in which there are 
bargaining unit employees is subject to the terms of the collective bargaining 
agreement.  5 U.S.C. § 6130(a).  

C.  FEMA organizations or specific work units without bargaining unit employees 
may offer CWS (e.g., 5/4-9 or 4-10) to their employees.  Program Heads of 
FEMA organizations, with OCCHCO approval, may develop a CWS to meet 
the operational needs of their organizations and/or work units. 

D.  FEMA organizations or specific work units without bargaining unit employees 
may establish a mandatory CWS, provided that the majority of the employees 
vote to be included in the CWS.  5 U.S.C. § 6127(b)(1). 

E.  Employees may request in writing to be excepted from a CWS or reassigned.  
The organizational head and supervisor must consider such a request and, if 
the CWS would impose a personal hardship on such employee, the head of 
the organization and supervisor must except the employee from a CWS or 
reassign the employee.  5 U.S.C. § 6127(b)(2).  

  Requesting a CWS 

A.  Employees may request to voluntarily participate in any CWS offered within 

their organization or work unit.  Employees requesting a CWS must: 

1.  Select arrival and departure times for each day in the biweekly pay period; 

and 

2.  Prepare a written request by completing FEMA Form 106-1-1-1, Request 

for Work Schedule and forward it to their supervisor for approval. 

B.  The employee’s supervisor must approve the selection of the non-workday in 

connection with the request for a CWS. 

15 

 
  Temporary Change in Scheduled Day Off 

A.  If the supervisor determines that the employee must work on his or her 

scheduled day off:  
1.  The employee may be paid overtime or granted compensatory time, as 

appropriate, for the hours worked in excess of the CWS; or 

2.  The supervisor may direct the employee to temporarily change his or her 

day off to another workday during the same pay period.   

B.  An employee may request a temporary change in his or her scheduled day off 
and that day may be changed or traded for another workday during the same 
pay period with advance approval of the supervisor. 

  Credit Hours 

Employees under a CWS may not earn credit hours.  5 U.S.C. § 6121(4). 

  Premium Pay 

See FEMA Manual 253-2-1, Premium Pay.   

16 

 
 
 
 
  
 WORK SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS 

  Administrative Dismissals 

A.  An administrative dismissal order may be issued when: 

1.  Normal operations of an establishment are interrupted by events beyond 

the control of management or employees;  

2.  For managerial reasons, the closing of an establishment or portions 

thereof is required for short periods;  

3.  It is in the public interest to relieve employees from work to participate in 
civil activities which the Government is interested in encouraging; or  

4.  The circumstances are such that an administrative order is not appropriate 
under 1, 2, or 3 above, and the Agency, under its regulations, excuses 
without charge to leave or loss of pay, employees paid on an annual 
basis.  See 5 C.F.R. §§ 610.303 and 610.305. 

B.  The authority to issue an administrative dismissal may only be used for brief 
periods, generally not exceeding three consecutive workdays in a single pay 
period.  See 5 C.F.R. § 610.302.   

  Variations in Work Schedules for Educational Purposes 

A.  Program Heads of FEMA organizations may authorize a special tour of duty 

of not less than 40 hours to allow an employee to take one or more courses in 
a college, university, or other educational institution as long as: 

1.  The course is not considered "training" under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 41; 

2.  The rearrangement of the employee's schedule will not interfere with the 

work needed to be accomplished; 

3.  Additional costs for personal services will not be incurred; and 

4.  Completion of the course will enhance the employee's work performance.  

See 5 C.F.R. § 610.122(a).  

B.  FEMA may not pay an employee premium pay solely because the special 
tour of duty causes him or her to work on a day, or a portion of a day, for 
which premium pay would otherwise be paid.  See 5 C.F.R. § 610.122(b). 

  Altering Work Schedules 

A.  Modification, suspension, or termination of an employee’s work schedule may 

be necessary to meet operational needs. Situations that may require 
modification, suspension,  or termination of an employee’s work schedule 
include: 

1.  Unexpected staff vacancies; 

2.  Disaster activities; 

17 

 
 
 
 
3.  Travel away from official duty station; 

4.  Participation in training; 

5.  Assignment on task force; 

6.  Participation in preparedness exercise; and 

7.  Other situations or emergencies where adjustment is deemed necessary 

by the supervisor. 

B.  Supervisors will notify employees in writing in advance of the upcoming 
administrative workweek of changes in their work schedule.  When the 
schedule change is required to meet operational needs, employees will be 
notified as far in advance as possible.   

C.  Employees may request changes to their work schedules by submitting a 

written request to their supervisor at least two weeks prior to the date of the 
requested change.   

D.  Changes in work schedules may not be made in order to create an 

entitlement to payment or to avoid an obligation for granting leave, holiday 
pay, or premium pay.  Except in emergency situations, changes to work 
schedules will be made effective on the first day of a pay period. 

E.  Employees may grieve supervisory-initiated work schedule adjustments and 
denial of an employee’s request for work schedule changes through the 
Agency’s administrative grievance procedure.  Bargaining unit employees 
must use negotiated agreement procedures, where applicable. 

  Procedures for Terminating AWS  

A.  If the head of the Agency finds that a particular AWS has had an “adverse 

agency impact,” the Agency must promptly discontinue the AWS.  5 U.S.C. § 
6131(a)(2).  

B.  Adverse agency impact is defined as: 

1.  A reduction of the Agency’s productivity; 

2.  A diminished level of services furnished to the public; or   

3.  An increase in the cost of agency operations (other than an administrative 

cost to process the establishment of an AWS program).  5 U.S.C. § 
6131(b).   

C.  If establishment of the AWS was negotiated, the Agency may reopen the 
agreement to seek its termination.  5 U.S.C. § 6131(c)(3).  If an impasse 
results, the dispute goes to the Federal Services Impasses Panel.  The Panel 
will decide within 60 days whether the Agency’s determination is supported by 
evidence.  If it is, the Panel must act in favor of the Agency.  5 U.S.C. §§ 
6131(c)(3)(B) and (C).  The AWS may not be terminated until the agreement 
covering the AWS is renegotiated or expires or terminates pursuant to the 
terms of that agreement or the Panel renders its final decision after an 
impasse during the renegotiation process.  5 U.S.C. § 6131(c)(3)(D).

  Designation of Holidays 

HOLIDAYS 

A.  Holidays are determined based on the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 6103 and 
Executive Order No. 11582, Observance of holidays by Government 
agencies, February 11, 1971.  

B.  The following are legal public holidays: 

1.  New Year's Day, January 1 

2.  Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., the third Monday in January 

3.  Washington's Birthday, the third Monday in February 

4.  Memorial Day, the last Monday in May 

5.  Independence Day, July 4 

6.  Labor Day, the first Monday in September 

7.  Columbus Day, the second Monday in October 

8.  Veterans Day, November 11 

9.  Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November 

10. Christmas Day, December 25 

11. Inauguration Day, January 20 of each fourth year for those federal 

employees working in the District of Columbia metropolitan area.  (When 
January 20 of any fourth year falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day 
selected for the inauguration of the President is a legal public holiday.) 

"In lieu of" Holidays   

A.  Only full-time employees, including those on FWS or CWS, are entitled to an 
"in lieu of" holiday when a holiday falls on an employee’s non-workday.  In 
such cases, the employee's holiday is the workday immediately preceding his 
or her non-workday.  For example, when the holiday occurs on a Saturday, 
the Friday immediately before is a legal holiday for those employees whose 
basic workweek is Monday through Friday.  In the case of an employee on 
CWS, the “in lieu of” holiday would become the day preceding his or her non-
workday.   

B.  There are three exceptions: 

1.  If the non-workday is Sunday, the next basic workday is the "in lieu of" 

holiday; 

2.  If Inauguration Day (for employees working in the District of Columbia and 

the immediate surrounding areas) falls on a non-workday, e.g., a 
Saturday, there is no provision for an "in lieu of" holiday; and 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
3.  The Agency head may determine that a different "in lieu of" holiday is 
needed to prevent an "adverse agency impact," and he or she may 
designate a different "in lieu of" holiday for full-time employees under 
CWS. 

  Holidays and Work Schedules 

Employees who are not required to work on a holiday receive their rate of basic 
pay for the applicable number of holiday hours, in accordance with the following 
work schedules: 

A.  Full time employees: 

1.  Employees under a TWS are generally excused from 8 hours of non-

overtime work. 

2.  Employees under a FWS are credited with 8 hours towards their 80 hour 
basic work requirement for the pay period, even if they would otherwise 
work more hours on that day. 

3.  Employees under a CWS are generally excused from all of the non-

overtime hours they would otherwise work on that day.  

B.  Part time employees: 

A part-time employee is entitled to a holiday when the holiday falls on a day 
when he or she would otherwise be required to work or take leave. This does 
not include overtime work. 

  Presidential Closing of Agencies 

The President occasionally issues an Executive Order closing Federal 
departments and agencies for all or part of a workday.  Employees are excused 
from duty during such periods unless they are "emergency employees," as 
determined by the Agency.  Such Executive Orders often provide that the time off 
will be treated like a holiday for pay and leave purposes.  Employees who are 
required to work during their basic tour of duty on such days are entitled to 
holiday premium pay.  See FEMA Manual 253-2-1, Premium Pay for further 
information.

Definitions 

A. Agency:   For the purpose of this SOP, the term “Agency” refers to FEMA. 

B. Special Need:  A documented need of the Agency for a specific set of skills and/or 
expertise that are relevant to the requirements of the position and are essential to 
accomplishing an important Agency mission, goal, or program activity. A candidate may 
also meet the special needs criteria by meeting the Agency workforce needs, as 
documented in the FEMA strategic human capital plan.  

C. Newly Appointed: First appointment as an employee in the Federal Government, 
regardless of tenure, or a subsequent appointment after a break in Federal service of at 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least 90 days, excluding a break in service following a temporary appointment or 
employment under the Student Educational Employment Program. 

VI.  Responsibilities 

A.  Hiring Officials: 

1.  Determine if a superior qualifications or special needs request will be submitted 

for a candidate. 

2.  Work with the Human Resources Liaison to develop the superior qualifications or 

special needs request. 

B.  Human Resources Liaisons: 

1.  In conjunction with the hiring official, prepare the written recommendation for 
superior qualifications or special needs pay authority with the appropriate 
supporting documentation. 

2.  Justify the request for superior qualifications or special needs pay authority. 

3.  Submit the request for superior qualifications or special needs pay authority to the 

Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer.  

C.  Human Resources Specialists: 

1.  Evaluate each request against relevant statutory, regulatory, and policy guidance 

to ascertain whether it meets established criteria. 

2.  Make an initial determination whether the request and supporting documentation 
contain sufficient justification for superior qualifications or special needs pay 
authority. 

3.  Forward the initial determination, request, and supporting documentation to the 

Chief Component Human Capital Officer or his/her designee for final review and 
approval. 

4.  Inform the Human Resources Liaison and hiring official of the 

approval/disapproval.  

5.  Ensure processing of the Standard Form (SF) 52, Request for Personnel Action, in 
accordance with the Office of Personnel Management’s Guide to Processing 
Personnel Actions and Guide to Personnel Data Standards. 

6.  Maintain a record of superior qualifications or special needs pay appointments in 

a separate centralized file within the office. 

VII.  Standard Operating Procedures 

A.  Superior Qualifications or Special Needs Determination 

1.  Superior qualifications appointments will be to journeyman level or senior level 

positions. Superior qualifications for entry level positions may only be considered 
when a candidate possesses education or experience in a unique specialty that is 
needed by the Agency in which it is hard to find high-quality candidates or in 
meeting a special Agency need. 

2.  Prior to a candidate entering on duty, the hiring official will determine if a request 
above the minimum rate of the grade (step 1) will be made for a newly appointed 
employee. The request will be based on superior qualifications or special needs. 

 
 
 
a.  Superior Qualifications: The hiring official may determine that a candidate 

has superior qualifications based on the level, type, or quality of the 
candidate’s skills or competencies demonstrated or obtained through 
experience and/or education, the quality of the candidate’s accomplishments 
compared to others in the field, or other factors that support a superior 
qualifications determination. 

b.  Special Needs: The hiring official may determine that a candidate fills a 

special need if the type, level, or quality of skills and competencies or other 
qualities and experiences possessed by the candidate are relevant to the 
requirements of the position and are essential to accomplishing an important 
mission, goal, or program activity. An example of a special need of the 
Agency is a manpower shortage in a particular occupation or a program which 
is unique to the Agency. 

3.  The hiring official will determine whether a recruitment incentive could meet the 
need, instead of the appointment at the higher step of the grade. This is important 
because a recruitment incentive is a one-time payment, while an appointment at a 
higher step is permanent. 

B.  Pay Rate Determination 

1.  An attempt will be made to maintain equity between the pay of the new appointee 
and that of current employees doing comparable work. Decisions to pay the first 
step should be based on a variety of factors which include, but are not limited to, 
post graduate degrees relating to the position being filled, professional licenses, 
exceptional work experience, etc.  When a decision is made to pay higher than the 
step 1, it should be based on the fact that the credentials are not commonly 
available in the workforce. 

2.  The hiring official, will consider one or more of the following factors, as 

applicable in the case at hand, to request a higher than minimum rate of pay using 
the superior qualifications or special needs pay-setting authority. 
a.  Level, type, or quality of the candidate’s skills or competencies. 
b.  Candidate’s existing salary, recent salary history, or salary documented in a 

competing job offer (taking into account the location where the salary was or 
would be earned and comparing the salary to payable rates of basic pay in the 
same location). 

c.  Significant disparities between the Federal and non-Federal salaries for the 

skills and competencies required in the position to be filled. 

d.  Existing labor market conditions and employment trends, including the 
availability and quality of candidates for the same or similar positions. 

e.  Success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for the same or similar 

positions. 

f.  Recent turnover in the same or similar positions 
g.  The importance/criticality of the position to be filled and the effect on the 

Agency if it is not filled or if there is a delay in filling it. 

h.  The desirability of the geographic location, duties, and/or work environment 

associated with the position. 

i.  FEMA’s workforce needs as documented in the strategic human capital plan. 
j.  Other relevant factors. 
C.  Required Approval and Documentation 

1.  Written documentation to authorize a rate above the minimum rate must be made 

before a candidate enters on duty in the position to which appointed. 

 
2.  The Human Resources Liaison, in conjunction with the hiring official, will 

prepare a written memorandum requesting a rate above the minimum rate of the 
grade (step 1), based on superior qualifications or special needs.  

3.  The written memorandum  will address the following factors: 

a.  The superior qualifications of the candidate or the special agency need for the 

candidate’s services which justifies a higher than minimum rate; 

b.  An explanation of the factor(s) and supporting documentation which were 
used to justify the rate at which the employee’s pay is set. The written 
documentation must explain how the factors directly relate to the rate  
requested; 

c.  The reasons for requesting a higher than minimum rate instead of or in 

addition to a recruitment incentive. 

4.  The memorandum requesting the superior qualifications or special needs pay 
authority will be signed by the hiring official and will require approval by the 
Office Head, Associate Administrator or Regional Administrator. 

5.  The Human Resources Liaison will submit the following to the Office of the 

Chief Component Human Capital Officer: 
a.  Signed memorandum that documents the justification of the superior 
qualifications appointment or special needs pay setting approval. 

b.  Current position description for the job being filled. 
c.  Candidate’s resume for Federal employment in which the selection was based. 
d.  Vacancy announcement advertising the position and identification of other 

recruitment sources used. 

e.  Copies of all certificates issued to the selecting official for consideration. 
f.  Copy of the candidate’s supporting documentation (e. g. latest earnings 

statements, previous year’s W2, Wage and Tax Statement) verifying salary 
history. 

6.  The Human Resources Specialist will review the written request and supporting 

documentation and make an initial determination.  

7.  The Human Resources Specialist will prepare a decision memorandum for the 

Chief Component Human Capital Officer or his/her designee. The memorandum 
will include the Human Resources Specialist’s recommendation to approve or 
disapprove and the factors considered. 

8.  The Human Resources Specialist will submit the superior qualifications or special 
needs request, supporting documentation, and decision memorandum to the Chief 
Component Human Capital Officer or his/her designee. 

9.  The Chief Component Human Capital Officer or his/her designee will review the 
written justification and supporting documentation from the Program Office and 
the recommendation from the Human Resources Specialist and make a final 
determination. 

10. The Human Resources Specialist will document approved superior qualifications 
or special needs requests on the SF-52, Request for Personnel Action as indicated 
in the Office of Personnel Management’s Guide to Processing Personnel Actions 
and Guide to Personnel Data Standards. 
a.  Block 29 – Pay Rate Determination – 7 Superior Qualifications Rate 
b.  Remarks – P04 – Pay set using the superior qualifications and special needs 

pay setting authority under 5 CFR 531.212. 

 
11. The Human Resources Specialist will maintain a separate record for each superior 
qualifications or special needs appointment. The record will be maintained in a 
centralized location within the Recruitment and Staffing Branch. The 
documentation will be sufficient enough to allow the action to be reconstructed 
from the record.  

12. Each record will document the superior qualifications of the candidate or the 
special need of the Agency for the candidate’s services; an explanation of the 
factors and supporting documentation considered to justify the rate at which the 
pay was set; an explanation of how the considered factors directly relate to the 
rate approved; and the reasons for authorizing an advanced rate instead of or in 
addition to a recruitment bonus.
