Good morning Max,

We recently received some guidance regarding reasonable accommodations for the COVID-19 vaccination
Executive Order.   Please see below for instructions.

Requests for reasonable accommodation due to a disability should be submitted to the FEMA Office of Equal
Rights through the Accessibility Compliance Management System (ACMS). The employee should
upload FEMA form 256-01, Request for Reasonable Accommodation, and any supporting documentation with
the request. Questions can be directed to FEMA-Reasonable-Accommodation@fema.dhs.gov.

More information will be forthcoming on religious accommodations and medical exemption process..

Kind Regards,

Ola Ismail-Alabi  MSc, SHRM-CP

Subject: RE: Reasonable Accommodation Request# RAR0017691

1.  I respectfully request exemption form the VACCINE MANDATE, and hereby stipulate that I meet the definition

of a person having a “disability” under Sec. 12111(A)(8) of the Act.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 

3.  I respectfully request exemption form the VACCINE MANDATE due a strong moral and religious Objection to

vaccines that were derived from aborted fetal cells.

a.  It is my sincerely held religious belief that, in being vaccinated with any of the currently available

alleged COVID-19 vaccines, I would be cooperating with and complicit in abortion – the ending of an
innocent human life –and that such would constitute a sin against God and a violation of His
Commandments, for which I would be held morally accountable by God.

b.  For that reason, I am also requesting a religious accommodation, under Title VII and any similar Texas
and or Washington DC state (district) law(s), that will excuse me from having to receive a COVID-19
vaccine, and further request that no adverse employment action be taken against me on account of my
religious beliefs. (1)

4.  Furthermore, recent case law arising from the Appeals in Darby v. Childvine Inc. et al; (No. 1:18-cv-0669)

concludes that no mandate of a party [an employer in this case] can interfere with a person’s “normal cell
growth” (pg. 6) for people or a class of people protected by the Act.

5.  The Emergency Use experimental gene therapy shots, colloquially and collectively called “Covid Vaccines,”
various parties are requiring you to receive are, in fact, designed to alter, impair and abrogate “normal cell
growth” by virtue of the genetic modifications made to your body that cause the production of Spike proteins
(sometimes “S-cells”); and as such may not be administered without express consent, whether the injectables
or drugs are approved by the FDA or not.

6.  “The FDA noted that Pfizer, “identified vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated

enhanced respiratory disease, as an important potential risk”.

7.  The EMA similarly acknowledged that “vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease” was “an important

potential risk… that may be specific to vaccination for COVID- 19”.

8.  Under current US Federal law and by international convention (Nuremberg Codex), no place of business or
otherwise, can seek your inoculation compliance with any drug or injectable, much less any of the four
available experimental gene therapy shots that are colloquially and collectively referred to as “Covid
Vaccines.”

9.  Such injectables are experimental, not fully approved by the FDA or any other authoritative body and may not
be compulsory as a matter of Federal law in the Emergency Use Authorization statute as more fully described
in 10 U.S. Code § 1107a.

10.  This subject is also covered by the Nuremberg Codex, which requires all signatory States to adopt the tenants

in their own Statutes, as is the case with US Federal law.

11.  In other words, there is no basis for me to submit to or provide evidence of compliance with any Covid

vaccination mandate whatsoever.

1.  Pfizer and BioNTech – The Pfizer Vaccine was protein tested using the abortion-derived cell line HEK-293.
a.  This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute [2]. This information is recorded by the Cold

Spring Harbor Laboratory.

2.  Moderna – The Moderna Vaccine was protein tested using the abortion-derived cell line HEK-293.

a.  This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute.
b.  This information is cited by the vaccine researchers Kizzmekia S. Corbett, Darin K. Edwards, and Sarah R.

Leist.

 
 
3.  C. Johnson & Johnson – The J&J Vaccine has publicly admitted to using a cell line called PER.C6.

a.  This is published on the Janssen website [5]. This information is enumerated by the Lozier Institute.

Good morning,

Thank you for submitting your request for reasonable accommodation (RA) and documents via the DHS Accessibility
Compliance Management System (ACMS). I understand from your FEMA Form 256 that you are requesting an
exemption from the executive order on mandatory COVID vaccination. However, there is no mention in any of the
documents submitted via ACMS of a disability or medical condition that prevents you from receiving the vaccine.
Please confirm if your request for exemption is due to a medical condition that prohibits you from getting vaccinated
or if you wish to proceed with requesting a vaccination exemption based on personal freedoms and/or religious
beliefs.

Respectfully,
Miriam Aybar-Morales
