Max,

Jacqueline Gause has left FEMA and I’m with the FEMA Texas National Processing Service Center (NPSC) now.  I
have copied Linda and Olawunmi, R-6 stakeholders for visibility and assistance.

Linda and Ola, please feel free to let me know if you need anything from my end, and I’ll be glad to oblige.

As always, thanks and best wishes,

J
