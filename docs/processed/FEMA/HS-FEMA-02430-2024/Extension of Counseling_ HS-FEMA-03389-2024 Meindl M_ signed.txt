FROM: EEO Counselor - Janet Kelley 

SUBJECT: Request to Extend EEO Counseling 

It has been determined that the counseling for the matter you brought to the attention of FEMA’s Office 
of Civil Rights (OCR) on May 15, 2024 will not be concluded by the 30 th day. In accordance with the 
requirements of 29 C. F. R.§ 1614.105(d), the aggrieved individual must agree, in writing to extend the 
counseling period. 

x

I am willing to grant an extension of the EEO counseling period not to exceed 60 
calendar days. I understand that granting this extension will not in anyway impede or hinder my 
rights in the discrimination complaint process. Instead, counseling will continue until your issues 
are resolved or until you receive a notice of final interview giving you procedures relative to the filing 
of a formal complaint of discrimination. 

            I am not willing to grant an extension of the EEO counseling period. I request that the EEO Counselor at 
the end of the 30-calendar day period schedule the final interview and provide me with all the appropriate notices to 
conclude EEO counseling.
