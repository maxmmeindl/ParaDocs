Meindl, Max7/21 12:28 PM 

KC, hoping all is well. In my last conversation with Tracey, I seem to recall, when discussing the back to work thing, that an RA 
request, short term 30 or 60 days if I recall correctly, could be approved by my first line permanent duty supervisor. Is that a 
correct understanding or did I miss something? I'm just wondering because my super signed off but then said he had to send 
it to the TRO.
