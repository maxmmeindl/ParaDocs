Given the nature of your questions, here are responses crafted with a pro-complainant bias, focusing on age, physical disability, and race discrimination. Please note that for actual legal proceedings, consulting with an attorney or an EEO counselor is highly recommended. 

What is your age?
I am currently [your age], born in 1951.

Do you believe that you were treated differently than similarly situated individuals? If so, please explain? List their (basis)
Yes, I was treated differently based on my age, physical disability, and race. Younger employees received more opportunities for professional development; non-disabled employees were not required to justify accommodations as rigorously; and employees of other races were given more prominent roles and projects.

State exactly, how you were discriminated based on age (1951), and physical disability.
Age: I was bypassed for promotions and training opportunities that were given to younger colleagues. Physical Disability: My requests for reasonable accommodations were consistently delayed or denied, unlike those of non-disabled peers.

Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of your age (1951) and physical disability?
There's a pattern where older employees like myself were not considered for advancement, and my disability accommodations were treated with skepticism, unlike others.

Do you have any witnesses to support your contentions in this matter? Identify by name, title, email, and nature of information to be provided.
[Name], [Title], [Email] - Can testify to the disparity in training opportunities and treatment of accommodation requests. 
[Name], [Title], [Email] - Observed the marginalization in team dynamics and project assignments.

Did you notify that discrimination was unwelcome when you were subjected to discrimination based on age (1951), and physical disability? If so, who?
I verbally informed [Name], my direct supervisor, and HR representative [Name].

What actions were taken?
No substantive actions were taken; I was advised to be patient or told that available accommodations were already provided.

Did you inform management that you were being harassed?
Yes, I reported this to my supervisor and HR.

Specifically, who denied your RA request? What reason was given for the denial? What did you request? Please explain.
[Name, if known] denied my request for ergonomic equipment and a modified schedule; the reason given was "budget constraints" though similar requests by others were granted.

Did you inform anyone in management that you were offended by this? If so, what response did you receive.
Yes, to [Name], who responded dismissively, suggesting I should manage the situation myself.

How were you harmed?
Physically, I experienced increased pain and discomfort; professionally, I was sidelined, which affected my career progression and self-esteem.

How did this affect your work environment?
It created a hostile atmosphere where I felt undervalued, leading to stress and reduced productivity.

Were you aware of similarly situated employees who were not denied their RA request. Please explain. Name employee and annotate by age and physical disability.
[Employee Name], age 35, with a similar physical disability, was granted all accommodations requested without issue.

Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of age?
The lack of opportunities for professional growth and the comments made about my 'retirement age' suggest age discrimination.

Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of physical disability?
The denial of accommodations and the dismissive attitude towards my needs indicate discrimination based on disability.

Is there anyone else that you think we should speak with that may have direct knowledge of this issue?
[Name], [Title], [Email] - This person can corroborate the discriminatory practices observed in the department.

Why were you issued a Notice of Termination of Appointment?
Officially, it was due to "performance issues," but this came after I raised concerns about discrimination.

Do you agree with the reasons given for terminating your employment? Please explain
No, my performance evaluations up until the discrimination complaints were satisfactory; the sudden change seems retaliatory.

Who notified you of your termination?
HR Manager, [Name].

Was this notification done verbally or in writing?
In writing.

Are you aware of any other similar situated employees who were not terminated during this time?
Yes, [Name], same race and similar performance metrics, was not terminated.

Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of your race?
The treatment I received, like being overlooked for projects, and the racial comments made by colleagues, indicate racial bias.

Why do you contend that you were treated differently because of reprisal?
The timing of my performance issues and subsequent termination directly followed my complaints about discrimination.

Do you have anything else to add?
The cumulative effect of these actions has not only affected my career but also my health and well-being. I seek recognition and redress for these injustices.

Remember, these answers should be tailored to fit your specific circumstances and supported by documentation where possible.
