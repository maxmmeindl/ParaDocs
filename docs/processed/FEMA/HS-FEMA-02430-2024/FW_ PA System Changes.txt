Subject: PA System Changes

Good afternoon,
This email communicates PA system changes that are further detailed in the attached .pdf
slide deck. We intended to brief these changes at the Dec standdown which has been
postponed. Additional information and external messaging will be sent next Friday,
December 15.

1.  EMMIE PA Functions to GM

We have been piloting Grants Manager closeout functionality in Region 8 and are
in the final stages of transferring the remaining EMMIE functions to Grants
Manager and Grants Portal (GM/GP). All EMs and DRs declared on or after January
15th will fully be processed in GM/GP and will not need EMMIE for closeout,
obligation, or reporting. To facilitate this transition, we are requesting regions to
provide two (2) individuals from each region to participate in Grants Manager
Train-the-Trainer sessions. The individuals should have closeout and obligation
responsibilities and experience and have the capacity and desire to deliver future
trainings to the respective region’s internal staff and external SLTT partners.
Please send your recommendations to fema-pa-tdb-webinars@fema.dhs.gov, and

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
include: Name, FEMA Cell #, Title, Supervisor name and title, and whether they
have GM login access.

Training details are as follows (additional info in the attached .pdf):

Title:                Grants Manager for Closeout and Obligations
Dates:             January 8 – 12, 2024 (5 days)
Time:               8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Central)                           
Location:         Virtual Classroom
Deadline:      Register by Friday, December 15, 2023, 4:00 p.m. (Central)

2.  EMMIE FMAG Functions to FEMA GO

We will begin rolling out FMAG in FEMA GO with a Region 6 pilot at the end of
March 2024. We are planning to do national rollout for all new FMAG declarations in
May 2024. We are in close coordination with regional FMAG staff as we plan the
rollout.

3.  Change Control Tool (CCT) to ServiceNow

As part of our continuous improvement effort and the decommissioning of
InfoPath, on December 22, 2023, the Public Assistance Change Control Tool (CCT)
and the Customer Experience Support Section Log will be replaced with the FEMA
ServiceNow Portal. Using the new PA Customer Assistance and Continuous
Improvement form, end users will have the ability to:

·         Request assistance with Grants Manager, Grants Portal, or available

program tools.

·         Report a PA system outage or performance issue.

·         Suggest a change/improvement.

In the coming weeks, additional information will be provided to help with this
transition.

Thank you for joining us in these exciting new changes to better serve Public Assistance
customers!
