All DHS employees who receive this email are required to provide proof of their vaccination status in the
Vaccine Status System by November 9, 2021. President Biden’s September 9, 2021 Executive Order
(EO) on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees requires that all federal
employees be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, except in limited circumstances in which an employee
receives a legally required exemption. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of
the Federal workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.
