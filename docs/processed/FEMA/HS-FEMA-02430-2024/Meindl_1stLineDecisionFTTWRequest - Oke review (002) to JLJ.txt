SUBJECT:  

Request for To Telework 

This serves to deny your reasonable accommodation request for episodic telework dated November 
26, 2018. 

As your Supervisor of Record (SOR), I reviewed your signed 256 Form, and medical documentation 
submitted in support of your request to telework as a reasonable accommodation. 

In order for a reasonable accommodation to be provided, it must first be determined that the 
individual making the request is a qualified individual with a disability. A qualified individual 
defined is as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the 
essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 
12111(8). 

42 U.S. Code § 12102 defines the term “disability” with respect to an individual as: 
(A) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of 
such individual;  

(B)   a record of such an impairment; or  

(C)   being regarded as having such an impairment. 

The EEOC defines a reasonable accommodation as any change in the workplace or in the way things 
are customarily done that provides an equal employment opportunity to an individual with a 
disability when an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential 
functions of the job held. 

The EEOC defines essential functions as those job duties that are fundamental to the position that the 
individual holds or desires. According to the EEOC, evidence of whether a particular function is

essential includes the agency's judgment (generally a supervisor's, manager's and/or office director's 
judgment), and a written position description developed before a job is advertised.  

The job announcement for the Cadre of On-call Response/Recovery Employee (CORE) position 
states:  

“All candidates must be able to deploy with little or no advance notice to anywhere in the United 
States and its territories for an extended period of time. Deployments may include working in excess 
of eight hours a day, or in excess of 40 hours per week, including weekends and holidays, and under 
stressful, physically demanding, and austere conditions.”  

In Demyanovich v. Cadon Plating and Coatings, LLC, 747 F.3d 419 (6th Cir. 2014), the court found 
that “a written job description and the employer’s judgment constitute evidence of whether a 
particular job function is essential”.  At the Texas Recovery Office Public Assistance Cadre (TRO 
PA) telework is not allowed for emergency management employees outside of very limited weather-
related cases. Management has determined it is an essential job function to travel to the office and 
visit applicants in person at their office location.   

Further, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an employer is not 
required to eliminate an essential function of a position in response to a request for reasonable 
accommodation.  Also, see (Minnihan v. Mediacom Commc’ns Corp., 779 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. 2015).  
Your request to telework would require removal of an essential job function.  The appropriate 
accommodation would be a reassignment to a position that allows telework. Should you choose to 
appeal the SOR’s decision, you may do so using the following procedure: 

Request for reconsideration: 

If an individual wishes to request reconsideration of this decision, she/he must take the 
following steps: 

An employee may appeal directly to his/her Second Level Supervisor. The employee may 
present additional information in support of his/her request. 

An applicant may appeal directly to the Disability Employment Program Manager of the 
Office of Equal Rights. The applicant may present additional information in support of 
his/her request. 

If an individual wishes to file an EEO Complaint, or to pursue MSPB or union grievance 
procedures, she/he must take the following steps: 

For an EEO complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614, contact an EEO Counselor in the Office 
of Equal Rights within 45 days from the date of this denial of reasonable accommodation; or
