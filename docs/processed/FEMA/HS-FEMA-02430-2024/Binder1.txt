my blind and disabled spouse. These conditions necessitate adjustments to my work environment to 
ensure our health and well-being while maintaining employment responsibilities.

2.  Shortness of Breath 

3.  Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unspecified angina pectoris 

4.  Angina Pectoris, Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction 

5.  Hypertensive urgency 

6.  Other forms of dyspnea

10. Supraventricular Rapid Heart Rate 

11. Angina, Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with other forms of angina 

pectoris 

12. Abnormal result of cardiovascular function study, unspecified 

Impact on Employee and Proposed Accommodation: 

I, Max J. Meindl, am experiencing considerable challenges due to the above medical conditions, impacting 
my ability to engage in a traditional work environment effectively. The nature of these conditions includes 

 
 
cardiovascular issues, respiratory distress, and gastrointestinal complications, all of which contribute to a 
complex health profile. 

The request for reasonable accommodation specifically involves remote/virtual/teleworking. 

This request is based on the following considerations: 

1.  Cardiovascular Challenges: 

o  Long commutes on crowded highways exacerbate stress levels, affecting blood pressure 
and cardiovascular health. Teleworking provides a controlled environment, reducing 
stressors and promoting overall heart health. 

2.  Respiratory Issues: 

o  The presence of dyspnea is exacerbated by exposure to environmental factors during 
commuting. Teleworking minimizes exposure to such factors, providing a more 
comfortable and controlled workspace. 

Medical Conditions and Specific Restrictions: 

1.  Cardiovascular Conditions: 

o  Elevated Blood Pressure, Atherosclerotic Heart Disease, Angina, NSTEMI Myocardial 

Infarction, Bradycardia, Abnormal ECG/EKG 

o  Restrictions: Limitation in strenuous activities, avoidance of stress-inducing situations, 

and concerns related to heart rate fluctuations. 

Impact on Commuting: 

In addition to the aforementioned medical conditions, Max J. Meindl faces challenges associated with 
extensive commuting on crowded highways, exacerbating their health concerns: 

1.  Stressful Environment: 

o  The congested nature of highways induces stress, particularly detrimental for 

cardiovascular conditions such as angina and elevated blood pressure. 

2.  Physical Strain: 

o  Prolonged periods of sitting during commutes contribute to musculoskeletal discomfort, 

especially for an individual managing osteoarthritis. 

3.  Unpredictability: 

o  Commuting unpredictability poses challenges for timely access to medical assistance in 

the event of any medical complications. 

Impact on Employee and Family Dynamics: 

In addition to the extensive medical conditions Max J. Meindl is managing, it is crucial to consider his role 
as the primary caregiver to his blind and disabled wife. This responsibility places additional demands on 
his time and attention, underscoring the necessity of accommodating his health needs while balancing 
the needs of his family. 

Caregiving Responsibilities: 

•  Max J. Meindl is the primary caregiver for his wife, who is blind and disabled. This role involves 
assisting with daily activities, providing emotional support, and ensuring her overall well-being. 

Benefits of Teleworking for Caregiving: 

• 

• 

Teleworking allows Max J. Meindl the flexibility to balance his professional responsibilities with 
the caregiving needs of his wife effectively. 

The controlled environment of teleworking provides a conducive space for managing caregiving 
duties without compromising the quality of care. 

Safety and Prompt Response: 

•  Remote/Virtual/Teleworking ensures Max J. Meindl is readily available to address any unforeseen 
emergencies or caregiving needs promptly, reducing the risk of complications related to his wife's 
disabilities. 

Considering the unique caregiving role Max J. Meindl plays at home, teleworking emerges as not only a 
reasonable but a vital accommodation. It enables him to fulfill his professional responsibilities while 
maintaining the high level of care and support required for his blind and disabled wife. 

Proposed Accommodations and Reasoning: 

1.  Remote/Virtual/Telecommuting Option: 

o  Facilitates a stress-free work environment, eliminating the physical and emotional strain 

of a lengthy city commute.

angina and heart rate fluctuations. 

o  Mitigates the stress associated with crowded highways, promoting a more tranquil work 

atmosphere.

needs. 

o  Accommodates musculoskeletal conditions by allowing flexibility in movement and rest 

periods.

promoting overall comfort. 

These accommodations aim to alleviate specific restrictions imposed by the medical conditions, ensuring 
Max J. Meindl can perform essential job functions effectively, while also recognizing and addressing 
challenges associated with extensive commuting on crowded highways. 

In summary, I request a teleworking accommodation for Max J. Meindl, taking into account both my 
medical conditions and caregiving responsibilities. This accommodation aligns with my healthcare needs, 
ensuring a safer, healthier work environment, and facilitates the proper care and support he provides to 
his wife.
