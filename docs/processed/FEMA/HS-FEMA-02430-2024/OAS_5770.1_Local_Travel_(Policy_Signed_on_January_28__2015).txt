GSA ORDER 

SUBJECT:  Local Travel 

1.  Purpose.  To provide guidance on the reimbursement of transportation expenses 
incurred on official business within the local area of an employee’s official worksite/duty 
station or appropriate alternative worksite. 

2.  Background.  While the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) regulates expense 
reimbursement for temporary duty (TDY) travel away from the official station for GSA 
employees, it does not provide guidance for local travel expense reimbursement.  Also, due 
to new policies, such as telework, the scope of local travel must be clarified.  

3.  Scope and applicability.  This directive provides guidance for reimbursing transportation 
expenses incurred on official business performed near a GSA employee’s official 
worksite/duty station.  Non-GSA employees who perform local travel at the request of GSA 
may be reimbursed as provided by their contract or inter- and intra-government agreement, 
as applicable.  Reimbursement to non-GSA employees will be processed through the 
financial system, not the e-Gov Travel System (ETS). 

4.  Cancellation.  This directive cancels chapter 7 of PFM P 4290.1 GSA Internal Travel 
Regulations and Control of Official Travel, dated August 24, 2004 (as extended). 

5.  Revisions.  This directive limits the reimbursement of local travel expenses to the 
amount that exceeds an employee’s daily commuting costs.  It also defines “commuting 
expense.” 

6.  Responsibilities.  The Travel Policy and Charge Card Program Office (H1BB) develops 
local travel policy for GSA employees.  Regional offices may supplement this policy, but 
regional policy may not change or conflict with official policy.  Regional policy must be 
cleared by H1BB.

LOCAL TRAVEL 

1.  Policy.  Reimbursement for transportation expenses incurred by a GSA employee 
performing official duties near his/her worksite/duty station1 will be limited to the amount 
that exceeds the employee’s round-trip regular commuting costs, even if that commute 
is not performed every day. 

2.  Definition of local travel.  Local travel is travel necessary to conduct official GSA 
business and is performed by the most direct route within and adjacent to an 
employee’s official worksite/duty station or appropriate alternative worksite.  The 
proximity of travel to the employee’s official worksite/duty station determines whether 
expenses are reimbursed as local travel expenses, as described in this policy, or as 
TDY travel expenses, as described in the FTR. Local travel does not include any official 
travel that is part of a TDY travel authorization, including travel to a common carrier 
terminal in the employee’s local travel area in conjunction with TDY. 

3.  Commuting expenses.  Commuting expenses are costs incurred while traveling 
between an employee’s residence and his/her official worksite/duty station.  Commuting 
expenses are calculated on a daily basis and are based on the method of transportation 
used for that day’s commute.  For example, if an employee purchases a monthly bus 
pass, but chooses to drive on the day he or she conducts local travel, the employee 
may be reimbursed for driving expenses (e.g., mileage, parking, tolls), that exceed the 
normal commuting costs of driving from his or her residence to the official station.  
When computing the amount for reimbursement, expenses are considered individually, 
rather than in aggregate, so that all excess mileage, tolls, and parking fees are 
reimbursed even if certain expenses are less than normal commuting costs.  The cost of 
the pro-rated “unused” bus pass is not a reimbursable expense. 

4.  Mass transit subsidies.  The GSA Fare Subsidy Program offers qualifying employees 
a financial incentive to use mass transit and other options for commuting to and from 
work in an effort to reduce traffic congestion and dangerous pollutants in metropolitan 
areas.  GSA employees who commute by public transportation, including subway, bus, 
train, or qualified vanpool, may receive "transit passes" or "fare media" through the 
program. The subsidy is only intended to cover the costs of commuting to an 

1 HCO 6040.1A GSA Mobility and Telework Policy paragraph 6d defines the official worksite/duty station as “the location where the 
employee regularly performs his or her official work duties …. Designation … must be determined on a case-by-case basis using the 
following considerations: 

   (1) The official worksite is the … place where the employee would normally work if not teleworking - as long as the employee is 
scheduled to report physically at least twice each biweekly pay period to that Agency worksite; 

   (2) The official worksite for an employee who is not scheduled to report at least twice a biweekly pay period to the Agency worksite 
(includes virtual workers/full time teleworkers) is the location of the appropriate alternative worksite (except in certain temporary duty 
situations); 

   (3) The official worksite for an employee whose work location varies on a recurring basis (mobile work), and who does not report 
at least twice each biweekly pay period to the Agency worksite, is the Agency worksite, as long as the employee is performing work 
within the same geographic area (established for the purpose of a given pay entitlement) as the Agency worksite.”

employee’s official worksite/duty station and return to home. It is not intended to pay for 
local travel to/from/between other places of official business, such as travel to an offsite 
meeting location.

January 28, 2015 

5.  Local travel areas. 

     a.   Central Office employees. 

           (1)  The local travel area for Central Office employees whose official 
worksite/duty station is in the Washington, DC metropolitan area has been established 
as follows: The District of Columbia, the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church 
in Virginia; Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia; and Montgomery and Prince 
George's Counties in Maryland. 

           (2)  For Central Office employees whose official worksite/duty station is located 
in a regional office, excluding the National Capital Region office (e.g., satellite 
employee), the local travel area is established by the respective Regional Administrator. 

     b.   Regional employees.  Regional Administrators (RAs) will determine their region’s 
local travel area.  RAs may use a mileage radius, the corporate limits of the city or town, 
or the usual commuting area of the official worksite/duty station (area served by local 
transportation services such as buses, streetcars, subways and trains).  No part of the 
area, however, can be more than 50 miles from where the employee regularly performs 
his/her duties or from an invitational traveler’s residence or regular place of business. 

     c.   Full-time telework employees.  Employees who telework full-time will have a local 
travel area of 50 miles from their residence or other appropriate alternative worksite 
designated as their official worksite/duty station. (HCO 6040.1A GSA Mobility and 
Telework Policy.) 

6.  Travel authorization.  A written or electronic travel authorization will not be issued for 
travel solely within an employee’s local travel area. 

7.  Government contractor-issued travel charge card.  Travel charge cards will not be 
used to pay for expenses unrelated to official TDY travel, including local travel, except 
for situations of imminent danger to human life or Federal property. 

8.  Tokens, tickets and passes.  In areas where mass transit services are available 
(subways, buses, etc.), offices should obtain tokens, tickets, and/or passes in advance 
with a purchase card (OAS 4200.1A Management and Use of the GSA SmartPay® 
Purchase Card), to eliminate the need for reimbursing these costs via a local travel 
voucher.  Offices should establish procedures to prevent inappropriate use of these 
items. 

9.  Local transportation expenses.  Based on cost and other factors (e.g., distance 
traveled, number of travelers, urgency), employees should select the method of travel 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OAS 5770.1

most advantageous to the Government.  Otherwise, reimbursement will be limited to the 
constructive amount of using the most advantageous method of travel (see examples in 
Appendix). 

     a.   Government-owned automobile (GOA).  A GOA must be used for local travel 
whenever available and most advantageous to the Government. 

     b.   Privately owned vehicle (POV).  Local travel via POV will be reimbursed based 
on the actual distance traveled (as shown on the odometer), minus the employee’s 
normal round-trip commuting distance/expenses, times the applicable mileage rate on 
http://www.gsa.gov/mileage.  POVs include privately owned automobiles (POA), 
privately owned motorcycles, and privately owned airplanes.  Reimbursement will be 
limited to the GOA rate when a GOA was available and advantageous to the 
Government, but a POA is used due to the personal choice of the employee instead. 

     c.   Mass transit services.  Travel between places of business via bus, subway, ferry, 
streetcar, etc., may be reimbursed as a transportation expense. 

     d.   Tolls, fares, etc.  Parking, ferry fares, and tolls may be reimbursed as a 
transportation expense when their use is determined to be necessary and 
advantageous to the Government. 

     e.   Taxicab. 

           (1)  A taxicab may be used if advantageous to the Government and necessary 
for urgent business.  Taxicabs may also be authorized for local travel between an 
employee’s office and residence if the employee depends on public transportation to 
perform official duties and he/she is directed to work outside of his/her regular hours 
and the local travel occurs during darkness or hours of infrequently scheduled public 
transportation. 

           (2)  Reimbursement is limited to taxicab fare for the usually traveled route plus tip 
(maximum 15% rounded up to the next dollar). 

           (3)  Receipts are required for any single taxicab fare (including tip) that exceeds 
$25. 

10.  Per diem. 

       a.  Prohibition.  No per diem or actual subsistence expense allowance (lodging or 
meals) will be paid for travel within an employee’s local travel area. 

b.  Exception for protection of human life or Federal property.  The Administrator of 
General Services or his/her designee may authorize reimbursement of subsistence/per 
diem expenses for an employee who must remain at his/her official worksite/duty station 
or appropriate alternative worksite due to imminent danger to human life or Federal

OAS 5770.1

property, and as a result, incurs lodging and/or meal expenses.  The Administrator or 
his/her designee must authorize in writing the need to incur subsistence/per diem 
expenses and the employee must then upload this authorization into the e-Gov Travel 
System (ETS) and request reimbursement.  The reimbursement will be processed on a 
local voucher as a miscellaneous expense.  As situations permit, contact the Office of 
General Counsel in writing for additional guidance before incurring any expense that 
may be covered by this exception. 

11.  Claiming reimbursement. 

a.  Approving officials must review claims for accuracy before approval.  Relevant 
factors include mode of transportation utilized, distance traveled, and the amount that 
exceeds the employee’s commuting costs.  The approval official must ensure that the 
mode of transportation used was more advantageous to the Government than other 
available modes of transportation.  

 b.  Claims must be filed on an ETS local voucher (travel.gsa.gov). 

c.  Claims should be filed monthly or when the amount for reimbursement exceeds 

$25.  If required, however, claims may be filed sooner. 

d.  When travel involves two or more GSA employees on official business, one 
employee should pay and claim the entire expense (e.g., taxicab fare, bridge toll, etc.). 

e.  All taxicab fare receipts exceeding $25 and any other local travel expense 

receipt exceeding $75 must be attached to the ETS voucher. 

f.   Employees must explain all taxicab use described in paragraph 9(e)(1).  That 
explanation must include the employee’s departure time from the office and justification 
for use of the taxicab.

Appendix.  Local Travel Scenarios 

OAS 5770.1 
January 28, 2015 

This Appendix applies GSA’s local travel policy to real-life scenarios.  Each scenario 
explains and calculates an employee’s local travel and commuting expenses, and if 
applicable, the reimbursement amount.  All mileage rates used below are examples 
only.  Current mileage reimbursement rates are posted at www.gsa.gov/mileage.  The 
scenarios also explain how different facts would affect reimbursement calculations. 

Scenario 1.  Sarah commutes 15 miles (one-way) to her official worksite and incurs a 
$20 daily parking fee.  On the day of local travel she reports to her official worksite in 
her privately owned automobile (POA) and incurs a $10 short-term parking fee before 
driving 10 miles to an off-site meeting where she incurs another $10 parking fee.  After 
the meeting, she drives 25 miles to her home.  Assuming a rate of 55.5 cents/mile when 
a POA is most advantageous, what is her reimbursable local travel expense?

Reimbursable 
Expenses

Reimbursement:  20 miles x 55.5 cents/mile = $11.10 

Explanation 1.  Sarah would be reimbursed for the 20 additional miles. The $10 
parking fee incurred at the meeting, however, is not reimbursable because it does not 
exceed her normal parking expenses usually incurred as part of her commute.  If she 
had been required to return to her official worksite, and as a result, incurred additional 
mileage and parking expenses before going home, the additional mileage would be 
reimbursed.  The additional parking would also be reimbursed, if it exceeded her normal 
$20 parking expenses. 

Scenario 2.  Same as scenario 1, but Sarah chooses to use her POA when a GOA is 
available and most advantageous to the Government, and returns to the office to do 
work, incurs another $10 parking fee and then goes home for the day.  Assuming a rate 
of 55.5 cents/mile when a POA is most advantageous, and a rate of 24 cents/mile when 
a GOA is most advantageous but a POA is used instead, what is her reimbursable local 
travel expense?

Explanation 2.  Like explanation 1, Sarah would be reimbursed the additional 20 miles, 
but since she failed to use an available and advantageous GOA, her reimbursement 
would be limited to the reduced rate.  Unlike explanation 1, Sarah would be reimbursed 
for the additional parking since her $30 parking expenses exceed her normal $20 
parking expenses. 

Scenario 3.  Bob teleworks full-time.  For personal reasons, he drives 15 miles to a 
local coffee shop to perform his work.

Explanation 3.  As a full-time telework employee, Bob’s residence is his official 
worksite.  Since Bob was not required to perform his official duties at the coffee shop, 
the costs incurred while traveling there are personal expenses and are not 
reimbursable. 

Scenario 4.  Julie is a full-time telework employee.  She is required to attend a meeting 
45 miles round-trip from her home.  Julie drives her POA, which is most advantageous 
to the Government in this case, to and from the meeting location.  Julie incurs two $5 
tolls on her EZ Pass and a $10 parking fee at the meeting location.  What is Julie’s 
reimbursable local travel expense?

Reimbursement:  $24.98 (45 miles x 55.5 cents/mile) + $10 + $10 = $44.98 

Explanation 4.  As a full-time telework employee, Julie’s official worksite is her home.  
Since Julie was required to leave her home to perform her official duties at the meeting, 
the costs incurred traveling to the meeting, as well as the parking fee are reimbursable. 

Scenario 5.  Typically, Ken commutes 75 miles round-trip to his worksite/duty station 
via van pool.  The van pool costs $175 per month ($125 paid with his transit subsidy 
and $50 paid out of pocket).  Ken is directed to attend a meeting near his worksite/duty 

                                                                                                                                      A-2

station.  Ken drives to the meeting and incurs a $10 parking fee.  After the meeting he 
stops by the office to do some work and incurs another $10 parking fee.  Ken then 
returns home at the end of the day, driving a total of 100 miles.  What is his 
reimbursable local travel expense?

Reimbursement:  $13.88 (25 miles x 55.5 cents/mile) + $10 = $23.88 

Explanation 5.  When an employee uses a mode of transportation for commuting that 
is different from what he/she normally uses, all normal commuting expenses associated 
with that mode are non-reimbursable expenses.  In this scenario, since Ken chose to 
drive, rather than use the van pool, his reimbursement is based on his expenses 
associated with driving.  Thus, the additional mileage and parking incurred at the 
meeting site are reimbursable.  The round-trip mileage between Ken’s home and 
worksite/duty station and the $10 parking fee at the worksite, however, are non-
reimbursable commuting expenses.  In addition, Ken is not reimbursed for the pro-rated 
“unused” bus pass. 

                                                                                                                                      A-3
