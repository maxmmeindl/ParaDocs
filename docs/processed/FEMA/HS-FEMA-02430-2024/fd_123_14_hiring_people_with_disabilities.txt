DIRECTIVE 123-14 

HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 

I. 

Purpose 

This directive sets forth the Federal Emergency Management Agency policy concerning the 
responsibilities of the Agency Disability Program Manager (Employment), supervisors, and 
employees to effectuate the FEMA Disability Employment Program. This directive outlines 
the means by which the Agency can meet its disability recruitment goals and the 
procedures for requesting reasonable accommodation. 

II. 

Scope 

This Directive applies to all Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) organizations 
and personnel. 

III.  Policy and Procedures 

A.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) is committed to serving all individuals equally. This commitment extends to 
individuals with disabilities. FEMA must provide access to Agency programs and 
activities equal to the access provided to non-disabled persons. 

B.  It is FEMA's policy, in accordance with Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 

1973, as amended, that no qualified individual with a disability shall be denied 
participation in, or benefits from, any program conducted by FEMA, including 
employment. 

C.  This Directive supersedes Director's Policy 4-05, Equal Opportunity for Persons with 

Disabilities, dated November 8, 2005. 

D.   It is FEMA’s policy, in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 

amended (29 U.S.C. Section 794d), requires FEMA to procure, use, maintain, and 
develop accessible electronic and information technology, unless doing so imposes an 
undue burden.   

E.  Accommodations for people with disabilities are not mandatory if FEMA demonstrates, 

through the reasonable accommodation process, that in providing such 
accommodations an undue financial or administrative burden will be created, or that 
the accommodation will alter the fundamental nature of the program or activity under 
review. The Director Office of Equal Rights has been delegated authority to make the 
final decision in denying such accommodations. 

IV.  Responsibilities 

A.  Deputy Administrators and Staff Directors shall: 

 
 
 
 
 
1.  Actively support the Agency Disability Employment Program. 

B.  The Agency Disability Program Manager shall: 

1.  Promote the recruitment, employment, advancement, and retention of people with 
disabilities, especially those with targeted disabilities, including disabled veterans 
(particularly those with a 30 percent or more compensable service-connected 
disability). 

2.  Provide technical support and assistance in providing reasonable accommodations 

for applicants and employees with disabilities.  

3.  Analyze data to identify whether FEMA is making progress in the hiring of 

individuals with disabilities. 

C.  Supervisors shall:  

1.  Review proposed or vacant positions during initial recruitment, modifying or 
restructuring them when possible to allow the placement of a person with a 
disability. The SF-52, Request for Personnel Action, to recruit for positions, shall be 
annotated to alert the servicing personnel office of the desire to target recruitment 
of applicants with disabilities.  

2.  Give full and careful consideration to all applications referred under the Disability 

Employment Program. 

3.  Make appropriate accommodations for employees within 15 working days; 10 

working days for applicants.  

4.  Provide for necessary retraining of employees with disabilities. 

5.  If an employee or supervisor is in a field location and they require assistance in 

accommodating a person with a disability, they should contact the Agency Disability 
Program Manager for assistance. 

V. 

Definitions 

A.  Disability, with respect to an individual, means:  

1.  A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major 

life activities of such individual.  

2.  A record of such impairment. An example of "a record of such impairment" includes 

a person who has a history of, or is considered as having, a mental or physical 
impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities. A 
"history" of impairment covers persons who have recovered from substantially 
limiting physical or mental impairments. Examples of persons who would fall under 
this part of the definition of the term "disability" include individuals who have 
histories of substantially limiting forms of heart disease or mental or emotional 
illness. 

3.  Being regarded as having such impairment. For example, an individual who walks 
with a slight limp may be regarded as physically unable to walk but actually not be 
substantially limited in either that major life activity or in the major life activity of 

2 

 
working. An individual may have no impairment at all but would be deemed 
protected by the Rehabilitation Act if an agency wrongly perceives him/her as 
having a substantially limiting impairment. 

B.  Essential functions are the fundamental duties of a job that must be performed with 

or without an accommodation.  

C.  Major life activities are functions which include, but are not limited to, caring for 
oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, 
learning, thinking, sitting, standing, reaching, interacting with others, concentrating, 
lifting, sleeping, reproduction, running, and working.  

D.  Mental impairment is any psychological or mental disorder which may include 

intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness or specific 
learning disability. 

E.  Physical impairment is any physiological disorder or condition which may include 
ailments which affect one or more of the following body systems: neurological, 
musculoskeletal, sensory organs, respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, 
genital-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, and skin or endocrine.  

F.  Qualified individual with a disability is a person with a disability who satisfies the 
skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the job which the 
person holds or for which the person applies. In addition, the person can, with or 
without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job.  

G.  Reasonable accommodation is a change in the work environment or the application 

process that would enable a qualified individual with a disability to enjoy equal 
employment opportunities. There are three general categories of reasonable 
accommodations: 

1.  Changes to a job application process to ensure that applicants with disabilities have 
an equal opportunity to participate in the application process and to be considered 
for jobs.  

2.  Changes which enable a person with a disability to perform the essential functions 

of the job or to gain access to the workplace; and,  

3.  Changes which allow persons with disabilities to have equal access to the benefits 

and privileges of employment.  

H.  Substantially limits refer to the degree of impairment, distinct from minor 

impairment that impacts major life activities.  

I.  Undue hardship involves a specific accommodation which may result in significant 

difficulty or expense. The determination of what constitutes an undue hardship is made 
on a case-by-case basis and pertains to the cost of the accommodation, the financial 
resources of FEMA as a whole.  

J.  Targeted disabilities are disabilities that the Federal Government, as a matter of 

policy, has identified for special emphasis in affirmative action programs. They include: 
deafness; blindness; missing extremities; partial paralysis; complete paralysis; 

3 

 
convulsive disorders; intellectual disability; mental illness, and distortion of limb 
and/or spine.  

K.  Disabled veterans are individuals with disabilities who were separated under 

honorable conditions from active duty in the Armed Forces and who have established 
the present existence of a service-connected disability or who are receiving 
compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension because of a public statute 
administered by the Veterans Administration or a military department. 

VI.  Authorities 

A.  Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. Section 791). 

1.  Prohibits selection criteria and standards that tend to screen out people with 

disabilities, unless such procedures have been determined through a job analysis to 
be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and an appropriate 
individualized assessment indicates the job applicant cannot perform the essential 
functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation.  

2.  Requires Federal agencies to develop affirmative action programs for hiring, 

placement, and advancement of persons with disabilities. Affirmative action must be 
an integral part of ongoing agency personnel management programs
