Traci, do you have a moment to speak?  RE; return to work/bi-weekly office visits, pending RA, just need a couple of minutes.  Max Meindl
 
Never mind, I'll figure it out, sorry to bother you  and... I have been going through the chain of command, just seeking better clarification.  Have a great day.
 
So sorry, I'm in a NEMA meeting with the RA.  I should be finished by 4pm
 
10-4, I work until 5:30, no issues, if you have a moment, great, if not, understood.

Did you receive a letter from FEMA medical that you would be subject to testing per FEMA requirements.
 
no letter, just the email guidance we have been receiving from you and others.
 
and an email stipulating the current RA requests are on hold
 
I'll go back thru my emails and check, but none that I recall
 
It should have been via email from FEMA medical that you would be subject to testing to return to the workplace per FEMA requirements.  
 
I'll check. 
 
 
Can you search on subject: Enrollment in COVID-19 testing program.  it would be from FEMA-Non-Response mailbox
 
WILL DO
 
I found this, but was unaware I was "enrolled" in a testing program. "Notice to Employees Enrolled in COVID-19 Testing Program".  So, I guess you could say I was "notified" so to speak. 
 
Yes, that's the email that you should have received regarding testing.
 
10-4
 
Traci, I was reading the appeals sent to us for information/reference and I don't know if this is an issue but after checking several Port of Galveston appeals today, I noticed the dollar amount in the first paragraph matches the number referenced on page 7.  for instance in the attachment/pic, the numbers don't match.  there may be a reason... but.. just a heads up: 
 
If not an issue, sorry for bothering you with nonsense.... be well
 
Will take a look, thank you!

Traci, I would like to thank you and Tony for taking time to speak with us.  To clarify, my most recent hiring experience, the one for which I was invited to the meet and greet, happened in about 4-5 months.  I think i applied in June or so and I was interviewed on 09/21/23, received the job offer on 10/30/23.  I just wanted to clarify my most recent HR experience.  I'm also going to put together a document and send to you, all the stuff I forgot to discuss, point out.  When you have a chance, I would love to speak with you about this senior citizen's (with a disability) experience  with the reasonable accommodation process, very enlightening Traci.  This is one thing I put together and shared with various leadership after going thru some mud wrestling with an applicant early on in the CBCS roll-out... www.maxpmp.org and there are some others which led to some FEMA improvements... be well...

Thanks for clarifying the hiring experience and I am very interested in hearing about your experience with the reasonable accommodation process.  You can reach out to my scheduler, Colleen Sciano, to get on my calendar.  It was great speaking with you and the other newly hired individuals at R6.  Look forward to additional discussion to hear about your experience.  Thanks and have a great weekend!

If we can wait until next week to see if you hear from the person assigned or not, I think that would be better.  I am acting RA today and my calendar is getting very packed with the hurricane response and declarations.

Of course, hopefully, we now got the ball rolling on this.  They are very far behind on RA requests!

It is impacting my ability to deploy, we have worked out some issues here at home and, with the current need, I'm trying to make myself available but it was denied because of the RA.. not sure about how that applies, but, I just want to help.
