Update on your vaccine mandate exemption request
Friday, February 4, 2022 3:16:38 PM

Office of the Chief Information Officer
OAST ACMS Notification

You are receiving this message because our records show that you requested an exemption from (or a
temporary delay in) complying with the vaccination requirement established in Executive Order 14043.  On
January 21, 2022, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a nationwide
preliminary injunction enjoining federal agencies from implementing or enforcing President Biden’s
September 9, 2021 Executive Order 14043, Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal
Employees.  To comply with this injunction, DHS is halting the review process for those who have
requested a religious or medical exemption to the vaccine mandate.  So long as the nationwide injunction is
in place, an exemption to the mandate is not necessary. 

While the litigation of this matter is pending, please be advised that the court’s injunction does not affect
workplace safety protocols related to vaccination status, such as masking, physical distancing, testing, travel,
and quarantine requirements or accommodation requests regarding such protocols.  Employees should
continue to comply with such workplace safety protocols as directed.  While we await a final disposition
from the courts, we will continue to keep your exemption request on file, and we will continue to keep you
updated as new guidance is received.

This is an official notification from the DHS Office of Accessible Systems & Technology (OAST). To unsubscribe from
