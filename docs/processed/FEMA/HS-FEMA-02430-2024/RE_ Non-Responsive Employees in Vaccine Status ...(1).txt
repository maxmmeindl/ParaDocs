Yes, I received the same.
Appreciate the heads up.
I did go to the portal but the option to “prefer not to answer” was gone.
What next… Have you have VD? Are you vaccinated against the clap?
Do you have herpes? Do you have head lice?
Anyway, when you have time, let’s talk for a few minutes on teams.
Going to make some coffee and rise above this nightmare….

Notice  to  Supervisors  of  Employees  with  a  Non-Attestation  Status  for
the COVID-19 Vaccination

Subject: Non-Responsive Employees in Vaccine Status System

Dear BERGIN, JOHN W,

Our records indicate that the following individuals on your staff have not submitted any
information into the Vaccine Status System (VSS) as of October 20, 202. These individuals
are also receiving a separate reminder message from this mailbox about their non-responsive
status in VSS. If any of these individuals do not directly report to you, please work with your
timekeeper to make necessary corrections in WebTA. If you are a Temporary Duty
Supervisor, do not change employees’ WebTA certifier back to their Supervisor of Record.   

MEINDL, MAX

All FEMA employees, including those seeking an exemption from the vaccination
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must submit their vaccination status via the
Vaccination Status System (VSS) by November 9, 2021.

As a supervisor, you must remind your employees of the requirement to submit proof of their
vaccination status in the VSS. You may use language from the sample message below and the
attached upload instructions to contact your employees individually.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
accommodation. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

If you have any questions, please reach out to FEMA-COVID-Vaccine@fema.dhs.gov.

Sample Message to Non-Responsive Employees in VSS:

Dear MEINDL, MAX,

Upon review of Vaccine Status System data, it appears that you have not yet attested to your
vaccination status as of October 20, 2021.

All FEMA employees, including those who seek an exemption from the vaccination

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
requirement for religious or medical reasons, must complete and submit their vaccination
status via the VSS by November 9, 2021.

As a reminder, all federal employees must be fully vaccinated by November 22, 2021, except
in limited circumstances in which an employee receives or has requested a legally required
exemption. This requirement is necessary to protect the health and safety of the federal
workforce and the members of the public with which we interact.

The VSS now includes the functionality necessary to collect proof of vaccination as required
by the Executive Order and implementing guidance. You are required to upload proof of your
vaccination status in VSS.  

If you do not have proof of vaccination, you must contact your place of vaccination or
healthcare provider to obtain documentation that can be electronically uploaded into the
system by November 9.

If you intend to seek a religious or medical accommodation, select the option “I have not been
vaccinated” in VSS and submit an accommodation request once available. More information
on submitting a request is forthcoming.

Employees  who  fail  to  comply  with  the  Executive  Order  14043  requirement  to  be  fully
vaccinated  and  provide  proof  of  vaccination,  except  employees  who  have  a  pending  or
approved  vaccination  accommodation  request,  may  be  subject  to  discipline,  up  to  and
including termination. 

Additional  resources  and  frequently  asked  questions  (FAQ)  are  available  on  the  DHS  VSS
Connect  page  and  the  COVID-19  Employee  Hub.  Visit  the  Employee  Resources  page  for
more information on DHS’s COVID-19 guidance.
