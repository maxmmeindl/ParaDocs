thorough and impartial investigation of my complaint of discrimination.  Therefore, I must provide 
a statement for the investigative record which is true and complete to the best of my knowledge 
and belief and which fully addresses the issues accepted for investigation.  My statement must be 
specific with regard to names, dates, places, circumstances, and related events, and disclose my 
firsthand knowledge of any information which is directly related to the issue(s).  My statement,

description of the issues for investigation shall serve as the basis for the investigation.   While I 
may  voluntarily  submit  any  additional  documents  or  information  to  the  investigator  for

become part of the investigative report.  If there are any documents or facts which substantiate my 
allegations, I must provide them to the investigator or make them known to the investigator.  I may 
suggest  witnesses to  be interviewed by the investigator.   However, the investigator will decide 
which witnesses to interview based on relevant information he or she feels will be furnished. 

I am aware of and my understanding of the protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,

accordance  with  the  rules,  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Department of Agriculture.  This means that any employee(s) 
whom I accuse of discrimination or other acts of impropriety may be shown relevant portions of 
this statement and be given an opportunity to respond.  Agency officials responsible for processing 
complaints of discrimination will have access to the entire investigative report.  If discrimination 
is found, any employee accused of discrimination will have an opportunity to review the report in

protected  by  law  and  the  EEO  regulations  from  any  acts  of  reprisal,  discrimination,  coercion, 
harassment, restraint, or interference for their participation in the investigation and other phases of 
complaint processing.  

I have the right to be represented by a person of my choice during presentation of complaint and 
preparation of my statement (so long as my choice does not result in a conflict of interest).  I have 
chosen a personal representative at this stage of my complaint.  In the event I have not chosen a 
representative  but  obtain  a  representative  at  a  later  date,  I  will  advise  the  investigator  and  the

a)  My reasonable accommodation requests was/were ignored, this specific RA for more 

than 190 days. When I finally pressed the issue to be resolved with higher authorities I 
was terminated., Age: I was bypassed for promotions and training opportunities that were

II.  1. On August 16, 2024, Complainant’s Reasonable Accommodation request was denied. 
29. Specifically, who denied your RA request? What reason was given for the denial? What did 
you request? Please explain. Did you inform anyone in management that you were offended 
by this? If so, what response did you receive. 

a.  Anthony In 

b.  The first denial was 08/05/24 and stipulated “Mr. Max Meindl’s reasonable 

accommodation to seek 100% telework cannot be granted.  It is understood that Mr. 
Meindl’s indication that he could deploy is close to his home; however, I cannot 
consider that in a decision to grant the request.  The option presented by Mr. Meindl 
is not a viable solution as I cannot grant him the ability to limit his deployment 
location.  Given that Mr. Meindl would need to be sent wherever the disaster is 
located and his inabilities to do would limit my ability, therefore, I must deny his 
request. 

c.  The second denial, Jodie Hunter, dated 08/15/2024, stipulated; “After careful 

consideration, Mr. Max Meindl’s request to telework 100% of the time is denied.  
The approval to allow Mr. Meindl to telework 100% of the time would require that 
the Agency remove the essential function of deployment from his duties and 
responsibilities.  Mr. Meindl signed his onboarding, acknowledging that his position 
required that he deploy.  While I understand that Mr. Meindl has a disability; 
however, his acknowledgment that he cannot leave his house to deploy under any 
circumstances contributes to my decision.  Finally, his branch (Infrastructure Branch, 
Recovery Division) supports disaster deployments on an almost daily basis.  His 
temporary accommodation cannot continue as assignments of duties are totally 
unrelated to his current position of record and cannot be continued.” 

d.  Sent to EEO Specialist, Reasonable Accommodation (RA), Disability Support Branch 
| Office of Civil Rights (OCR) on 08/22/24; I do not believe that I am no longer able 
to perform the essential functions of the specified position. I am limited in my ability 
to “physically” deploy, obviously due to health issues. *This may impact the 
preferred way or process that my SOR and second line SOR utilize, so, out of a sense 
of professionalism, I will defer to their preferred process. I was blissfully unaware 
that the position required 50 weeks physical deployment per year.  I don’t recall that 
information being provided during the interview. If you can access the job interview 
transcript, it is very clear that I was not aware of that requirement. When told that 
information by SOR in first conversation, well.. we started discussing how to unwind 
the situation because I couldn’t physically deploy.  The only “interactive process” I 
had was one formal conversation with SOR and RA personnel. This specific RAR 
was opened on 01/02/2024 and after contacting leadership, it was moved up to 
expedited.  This happened after being in the queue for 190 days.  The note to “reply 
no later than” sort of stuff after experiencing no response to 5 RAR over the years 

Initials _____mjm______ 

Page 6 of 17 

 
 
was unacceptable and extremely frustrating.  This RAR sat for months and then gets 
turbocharged in mere days, all to the detriment of my position, at least from my 
perspective. Ignored, abused, dismissed.  My understanding, at this time, is that the 
“essential function” impact identified is “deployment”.  I can and do provide the 
essential functions and elements of the PDTFL position assist, PDTFL duties and 
responsibilities. The majority of my time with FEMA has been in a virtual status. 
Primarily due to declining health. For the past few years, a proactive SOR and 
assistive leadership sought out and provided an effective accommodation process that 
enabled me to enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment. I have been virtually 
deployed (03/2020-05/2023),  38 months    (add 9 months for temporary duty with 
limited assignments since 12/2023, when I could have been deployed virtually to 
assist practically anywhere). I have physically deployed (09/2017-06/2018 (+/-) and 
05/2023-11/2023.  15 months. In office approximation (06/2018-03/2020), 21 
months.  I do acknowledge limitations due to various conditions as stipulated in the 
appropriate documents and these do impact my physical ability to deploy. It does not 
impact my ability to deploy virtually as I have been doing since 03/2020. There was a 
short field deployment (05/23-11/23) to 4705DR, with was problematic with a 
medical event being tossed into the mix.  I was under the assumption we were 
exploring options for accommodation, maybe short term if appropriate, and Tony and 
I were developing an accommodation that might work, a discussion to deploy to 
Houston was had on 05/29/24.  When asked by my SOR on 05/29/24 if I could 
deploy to Houston, I concurred and 9 minutes later he called back and told me he was 
overruled. In subsequent conversations with my SOR, discussing my being under-
utilized and the deployment option to Houston being dismissed I asked why, and the 
response was that he was told to stand down on this issue. From my perspective, my 
SOR, at that time and maybe still is, the “deciding official” was working with me, 
both of us trying to work something out, which we did, and his decision was 
overruled. It is unclear to me why it was overruled. I would like to assume it was 
because of a concern over my health. If so, why not a virtual deployment option? I 
have spoken with SOR many times about my concerns over being underutilized and 
how I could do more for the mission. I was deployed, virtually, to 4611DR, (09/2021-
05/2023) as a PDTFL. 

30. How were you harmed? 

a.  Physically, I experienced increased mental discomfort; professionally, I was 

sidelined, which affected my career progression and self-esteem. 

b.  Much of the following has not been addressed in the denial.  
c.  “The denial must clearly state the specific reasons for the denial, which shall include, 

where applicable:” 

d.  Why would the requested accommodation not be effective. 
e.  Why the accommodation requested would result in undue hardship to the Agency;

explain. Name employee and annotate by age and physical disability.

protected characteristics

a.  The denial of accommodations and the dismissive attitude towards my needs indicate 

discrimination based on disability.

a.  Documents stated they could not provide reasonable accommodation anywhere

the Rehabilitation Act to provide accommodations on an individual basis, not through 
blanket policies. 

b.  No, my performance evaluations met or exceeded expectations; the sudden change 

seems retaliatory. 

c.  In the informal communication with FEMA before this filing, I was told by their 
legal counsel that they had a policy that would not allow for remote work.  

d.  This did not address the need for remote work to be an accommodation, as it should 

be made on an individual basis and not a blanket policy.  

e.  This also did not address my clear ability to complete my job while working fully 

remote for the previous four years.

o  August 15, 2024: Jodi Hunter reaffirmed the denial, arguing that approving my request 

would require removing an essential function of deployment from my role. 

•  Legal Violations & Discrepancies:  

o  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 501: Requires agencies to provide reasonable 

accommodations unless it creates undue hardship. 

o  My 190+ day wait for adjudication violates EEOC standards for timely accommodation. 
o  My four years of successful remote work proves that physical deployment was not an 

essential function. 

•  Failure to Properly Justify Denial: 
FEMA failed to clearly state:  

o  Why the requested accommodation would not be effective. 
o  Why the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship to the agency. 
o  Whether medical documentation provided was inadequate to establish that I have a 

disability and need a reasonable accommodation. 

o  Whether the requested accommodation would require the removal of an essential 

function. 

o  Whether the requested accommodation would require the lowering of performance or 

production standards. 

2. Wrongful Termination (January 6, 2025) 

•  Decision Maker: Anthony In 
•  Other Involved Individuals: Jodi Hunter, Don Simko, and FEMA legal counsel 
•  Termination Reason Given:  

o  FEMA stated it could not provide reasonable accommodation anywhere within the 

agency. 

o  No alternative placements were considered despite my experience and qualifications. 

•  Legal Violations & Retaliation Evidence:  

o  Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228 (2005): Established that employment policies can 
be discriminatory under the ADEA based on disparate impact, even without intent. 

o  Retaliation: My termination followed my formal requests for accommodations, 

demonstrating a direct link between my protected activity and adverse action. 

Comparative Disparities 

•  Younger, Non-Disabled Employees:  

o  Received professional development opportunities and promotions. 
o  Were provided flexible work accommodations that I was denied.
