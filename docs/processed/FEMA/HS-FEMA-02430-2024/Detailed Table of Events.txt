Detailed Table of Events, Dates, Names, Policy/Statute/Law Violations, and Quotes for EEO Investigation
This table consolidates critical events, dates, involved individuals, policy/statute/law violations, and direct quotes from emails or Teams messages, based on provided documents, including RA communications, FMLA determination, rebuttals to witness affidavits, prior analyses, the comprehensive response, "PERPLEXITY SUMMARY-APRIL 2025.docx," and new attachments ("RA EMAIL ALL FOUND-12-05-2024.xlsx," "RA EMAIL LIST-12-04-24.xlsx"), Max J. Meindl, case HS-FEMA-02430-2024, it addresses FEMA’s mishandling of Reasonable Accommodation (RA) requests, retaliatory termination on January 6, 2025, and inability to accommodate older employees. Each entry includes evidence, responsible parties, violations of federal laws, EEOC Management Directive 110 (MD-110), FEMA policies, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), with quotes from the new attachments where applicable.
Notes on Violations, Evidence, and Quotes:
Rehabilitation Act §501 (29 C.F.R. §1630): Requires individualized assessments and prohibits disability discrimination. FEMA’s failure to explore virtual deployments and termination without accommodations violate this statute.
HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR §164.312): Mandates secure PHI transmission. Unencrypted emails by Clemons breached Meindl’s privacy.
EEOC MD-110: Guidelines for EEO processes. Violations include untimely processing (§IV.D), undocumented interactive processes (§VI.A), redundant documentation requests (§VI.C), inadequate investigation (§VI), and ignored retaliation indicators (§XI).
FEMA Instruction 256-022-01: Sets 45-day RA processing timeline, consistently exceeded (e.g., 194 days for RAR0046767, 986 days for RAR0023261).
FEMA Manual 123-13-1: Requires 30-day notice, progressive discipline, and Douglas Factors for adverse actions. Termination lacks these elements.
FEMA Directive 123-0-2-1: Mandates welfare checks post-disaster. Failure post-Hurricane Beryl neglected Meindl’s well-being.
ADEA (29 U.S.C. §623): Prohibits age discrimination. FEMA’s disparate treatment, delays, and neglect suggest age bias (Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228).
OMB M-17-06: Governs feedback protocols; premature OAST surveys violate resolution-based requirements.
Quotes/Statements: Quotes are included from new attachments where specific email content is provided. Where unavailable, the absence is noted, and the source is referenced. Some quotes are paraphrased for brevity while preserving intent.
Recommendations for EEO Investigator:
This table, updated with new email evidence, underscores FEMA Region 6’s systemic noncompliance, including delays, privacy breaches, welfare neglect, age-based discrimination, and retaliatory termination. The investigator should:
Verify RA processing timelines via FEMA logs.
Review unencrypted email threads for HIPAA compliance.
Interview named individuals (Clemons, Brasher, Underhill, In, Hunter, Aguilo, Myers, Simko, McAllister, Dickerson, Towndrow, Kelley, Schauer) to clarify decisions.
Assess age-based disparate treatment by comparing accommodations for younger vs. older employees.
Investigate lack of call-down post-Hurricane Beryl, per FEMA Directive 123-0-2-1.
Examine premature OAST surveys for procedural irregularities.
Clarify timing of RAR0046767 denial (Dec 2 vs. Nov 26, 2024) to resolve discrepancies.
This table provides a comprehensive, evidence-based chronology with direct quotes to support Meindl’s EEO complaint, highlighting FEMA Region 6’s violations and systemic issues affecting older employees.
