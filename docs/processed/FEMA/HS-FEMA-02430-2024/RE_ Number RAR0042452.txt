Ms. Henri,

An observation:
Policy stipulates clearly, the following:

From Policy: Instruction 256-022-01: Reasonable Accommodation Program, January 2022, page 8
Medical documentation will be considered sufficient if it meets the following criteria: 
• Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual's condition;
• The activity or activities that the condition limits;
• The extent to which the condition limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities; and
• Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed.

And yet, DU stipulates their own requirements:
From DU, Miriam via email:
Criteria for sufficient medical documentation:
1.           Describes the nature, severity, and duration of the individual’s impairment;
2.           The major life activity or activities that the impairment limits;
3.           The extent to which the impairment limits the individual’s ability to perform said activity or activities;
4.           Substantiates why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed; and,
5.         Why the individual requires the particular reasonable accommodation requested, as well as
6.         How the accommodation will assist the individual in performing the essential functions of the job.

Thank you for your assistance.
