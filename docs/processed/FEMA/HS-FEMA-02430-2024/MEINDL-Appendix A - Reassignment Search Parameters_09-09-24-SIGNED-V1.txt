Appendix A: Reassignment Search Parameters 

Conducting a Search for a Vacant Position 

It has been determined that there is no reasonable accommodation which would enable you to perform the 
essential functions of your current position.  Accordingly, the Agency will now conduct a search for another 
vacant position, for which you are qualified, and to which you may be reassigned as an accommodation.  The 
initial reassignment search will be within your employing Component.  If a search for a reassignment within your 
employment Component does not produce suitable results, a search will be conducted Department-wide.  To 
assist you in making informed decisions, any offer of a vacant position will be made in writing and will specify 
the consequences of rejecting the offer. 

To ensure that an effective search may be conducted, you must answer the following questions.  Your answers 
to these questions will determine the specific parameters of the reassignment search.  If you answer “no” to any 
question, a search for vacant positions in that category will not be conducted and you will have waived your right 
to consideration for such positions as a form of reasonable accommodation.  If you skip any question, your 
answer will be construed negatively in terms of search criteria and parameters.
