DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

I.  Purpose 

A. 
These procedures implement the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS or Department) Directive 259-01, “Providing Reasonable Accommodations 
for Employees and Applicants with Disabilities,” and associated Instruction 259-
01-001 Revision 01, “Providing Reasonable Accommodations for Employees and 
Applicants with Disabilities and Personal Assistance Services for Employees with 
Targeted Disabilities,” by establishing requirements for DHS Support 
Components (Headquarters (HQ) or agency) for processing requests for 
reasonable accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities, and 
personal assistance services to employees with targeted disabilities.  Personal 
assistance services (PAS) are also provided for employees with targeted 
disabilities to allow employees to participate in the workplace, except when such 
accommodation would cause undue hardship or would cause a direct threat to 
the employee or to others.  (Appendix H). 

B. 
These procedures are not intended to create any right or benefit 
enforceable against DHS beyond those specifically provided for in applicable 
statutes or regulations; nor does the use of particular procedures create any right 
or benefit under the regulations that provide those procedures. 

II.  Scope 

These procedures apply to all program offices within DHS HQ, with the exception of the 
Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) and the Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), both of which are responsible for issuing separate procedures applicable 
to their own employees and applicants.

IV.  Definitions 

Accommodation Tracking Database (ATD):  A secure, electronic 

A.  
computer database designed to record and track accessibility and  
accommodation requests from employees or applicants for employment.  

Decision-Maker:  A management official, designated by the program  

B.  
office, with the authority to determine, based on the facts presented, whether an  
accommodation will be provided, pursuant to  a request for reasonable 
accommodation.  The  preference is for an individual’s immediate supervisor to be 
the Decision-Maker to  facilitate timely processing of  requests and  to eliminate 
unnecessary levels of review.  

Essential Functions:  Job duties so fundamental to a position that  the 

C. 
position requirements cannot be fulfilled without successful performance of these 
duties.   A function is determined to be “essential” if, among other things:  the  
position exists specifically to perform that function; there are a limited number of  
other employees who  could perform the function; or the function is specialized,  
and the individual is hired based on his/her ability to perform it.    

Disability:  With respect to an individual, means a physical or mental  

D. 
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of 
such an impairment, or being regarded as  having such an impairment that is not

both transitory and minor. 

Disability Program Staff (DPS):  Individuals within the HQ Components 

E.  
assigned to coordinate with and assist the RAPM in facilitating the 
accommodation request process in accordance with EEOC regulations and DHS 
Guidance and facilitating the interactive process between employees and  
managers.  

Interactive Process:  The process by which the individual requesting an  

F. 
accommodation and the Decision-Maker engage with each other, along with 
assistance, as needed, from the Reasonable  Accommodation Program Manager 
(RAPM) or the Disability Program Staff (DPS) about the request for an  
accommodation, the ways in which an employee is substantially limited in one or 
more major life activities, the process for determining whether an accommodation 
can be provided, and identifying an effective accommodation.  

G.  Major Life Activities:  Basic activities that the average person in the 
general population can perform with little or no difficulty, such as (but not limited  
to) caring for oneself, performing  manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, 
speaking, breathing, learning, working, and major bodily functions, such as the 
functioning of the immune system.  

Personal Assistance Services (PAS):  Assistance with performing  

H. 
activities of daily living that  an individual would typically perform if he or she did  
not have a disability, and that is not otherwise required as reasonable 
accommodation, including, for example, assistance with putting on or removing 
clothing, eating, and using the restroom.  

Personal Assistance Service Provider:  An employee  or independent 

I. 
contractor whose primary job functions include providing personal assistance 
services. 

Qualified Individual:  An individual who satisfies the requisite skill, 

J. 
experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment 
position the individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable 
accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position.  

Reasonable Accommodation:  Any change  or modification in the work 

K.  
environment or in the way things are customarily done  that would enable a 
qualified individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities.  
There are three categories of reasonable accommodations:  

1.  
Modifications or adjustments to a job application process that 
enable a qualified applicant with  a disability to be considered for the 
position  such qualified applicant desires;  

2.  

Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the

manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is 
customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to 
perform the essential functions of that position; and 

Modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity’s 
3. 
employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of 
employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees 
without disabilities. 

Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager (RAPM):  Individual 

L.  
who determines that an individual meets the definition of an individual with a 
disability and facilitates the  accommodation request process in accordance with 
EEOC regulations and DHS Guidance, and  facilitates the interactive process 
between employees and Decision-Makers.  

Reassignment:  A form of reasonable accommodation that, absent undue  
M.  
hardship, may be provided as a last resort to  employees (not to applicants) who,  
because of a disability, can no longer perform the essential functions of their job,  
with or without reasonable accommodation.   Reassignments are made only to  
vacant, funded positions within DHS and  only to employees who are qualified for 
the new position.  When reassignment is  the  only accommodation available, and  
there is a vacant, funded position for which the employee is qualified at the 
employee’s current or a lower grade, the employee should be reassigned to the 
position without having to compete for it.  Reassignments are made consistent 
with DHS Instruction 259-01-002, Procedures for Conducting a Department-Wide 
Search for a Reassignment as a Reasonable Accommodation of Last Resort.  

N. 
Request for Reasonable Accommodation:  A verbal or written  
statement (no particular language/wording is required and it does not need to be  
submitted to any parti
needs an adjustment or change in working conditions or requirements, in the 
application process, or in relation to a benefit or privilege of employment, for a 
reason related to a disability. 

cular management official) to the effect  that an  individual 

Requester:  An employee, applicant, or individual acting on behalf of  an 

O. 
employee or applicant, who requests reasonable accommodation. 

Senior Management Official:  The Senior Management Official,  

P.  
designated by the head of a program office, who is assigned the responsibility for 
making a determination on an employee’s request for higher-level review of a 
denial of a reasonable accommodation issued by  the Decision-Maker. 

Q. 
Targeted Disability:   A subset of conditions that are considered 
disabilities under the Rehabilitation Act and for which qualified individuals with  
certain disabilities (i.e., such as blindness, deafness, paralysis, convulsive 
disorders, and mental illnesses, among others) have faced significant barriers to 
employment that are above and beyond the barriers faced by people with the

broader range of disabilities.  See the Office of Personnel Management’s 
Standard Form 256 for a complete list of targeted disabilities. 

Undue Hardship:  Significant difficulty or expense,  considering the  

R. 
resources and circumstances of the Department, in relationship to the cost or 
difficulty of providing a specific accommodation.  Undue hardship refers not only 
to accommodations that impose  financial difficulty, but to accommodations that 
are unduly extensive, substantial or disruptive, or those that  would fundamentally  
alter the nature of the  position or operation of the business.   Whether a particular 
accommodation would cause undue hardship is assessed on a case-by-case 
basis.  No reasonable accommodation is required if all  possible accommodations 
(including reassignment) would cause “undue hardship” to the Department.  This 
definition of an undue hardship also applies to personal assistance services.  

V.  Responsibilities

consistent with the timelines identified  in the procedures.  

VI.  Procedures And Requirements 

A. 

General Processing Time-Frames 

All HQ officials involved in the accommodation process are 

1.  
expected to act as quickly as reasonably possible when processing 
requests and providing accommodations, as failure to respond promptly to 
a request may result in a violation of the Rehabilitation Act; however, the 
time necessary to process a request will depend on the nature and 
complexity of the accommodation requested and whether it is necessary 
to obtain supporting information.   

Generally, the agency must provide a written decision to approve or 
2.  
thin fifteen (15) business days of receipt of all requested  
deny a request wi
information, but said decision shall issue no later than thirty (30) business 
days from the time the request for accommodation is made, absent  
extenuating circumstances. In the case of an approved accommodation 
request, the agency shall likewise provide the acco
than thirty (30) business days from  the time the request is made, absent 
extenuating circumstances.  

mmodation no later 

When extenuating circumstances—unusual or  atypical 

3.  
circumstances that may require action that differs from the ordinary course 
of action—are present, the time period for processing an accommodation 
request and providing an approved accommodation may take longer and  
may be extended as reasonably necessary to deal with the extenuating 
circumstance.  If there is a delay in processing a request for an 
accommodation or providing an accommodation, the RAPM or the 
decision-maker must notify the employee of the reason for the delay, 
including any extenuating circumstances that justify the delay. The 

11

Revision # 00 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

following situations are examples of extenuating circumstances and are 
not intended to be exhaustive: 

A delay in the purchase of equipment due to  regulatory or

a. 
policy requirements;

A delay because the employee requesting an 

b. 
accommodation requires an assessment or fitting, and equipment
must be ordered;

A delay because an accommodation involves the removal of 

c.
an architectural barrier; 

A delay in an employee gathering additional information,

d. 
including medical documentation. 

A delay necessary for the Agency to explore the feasibility of 

e. 
a particular accommodation.

A delay associated with evaluating an unusually complex

f.
request that warrants exceeding the 30-day timeframe (e.g., a 
request from an employee whose position  entails physical
requirements or medical standards  that create additional
complexities).

B. 

Requesting an Accommodation: 

Generally, HQ will not provide an accommodation until an individual makes such  
a request.  However, a manager should begin the accommodation process 
without being asked if the manager knows that (i) the employee has  a disability; 
(ii) the employee is having workplace problems because of the disability; and (iii)
the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable 
accommodation.  If in response, the individual with a disability states that s/he 
does not need a reasonable accommodation,  management will have fulfilled its
obligation. Additionally, in some circumstances where an individual has a
recurring, predictable need for an accommodation, management may be
obligated to provide the accommodation, as  needed.  For requests needed on a
recurring basis, the employee may obtain the accommodation by notifying the
appropriate office.  Once an initial accommodation has been approved,
management may not require the employee to submit a written request each time
the accommodation is needed.  

The reasonable accommodation process begins when a written or

1.
oral request for an accommodation is made.  An employee or applicant
should direct their request for a reasonable accommodation to:

a.

The ATD  at  Accessibility Compliance Management System;  

12 

Instruction Manual # 259-01-001-01 
Revision # 00 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

b.  

The RAPM or DPS at  accommodations@hq.dhs.gov; 

Any supervisor or a manager in the employee’s immediate 

c. 
chain of command; or   

An OCHCO employee with whom an applicant has had 

d.  
contact in connection with the application process.  

2.  
Regardless of who initially receives the request, an employee or 
applicant seeking a reasonable accommodation should be instructed by 
the RAPM or DPS, or supervisor or manager, to follow up on his/her initial 
request by confirming such request in writing by completing the DHS HQ 
Reasonable Accommodation Request Form (Appendix A).  However, a 
request though ATD  or in writing is not mandatory, and the absence  of a 
written request alone is not a reason to delay processing the request.  

A family member, health professional, or other representative may 

3. 
request an accommodation on behalf of an employee or applicant.  Such a 
request must be made in the same manner in which the employee or 
applicant is required to make the request.  However, the RAPM, DPS or 
Decision-Maker will, as quickly as possible, confirm with the employee or 
applicant that she/he indeed intends to request an accommodation. 

A request need not be  formal or consist of any specific words or 

4.  
terminology, such as “reasonable accommodation,” “disability,” “ADA” or 
“Rehabilitation Act.”  An  employee or applicant with a disability can 
request a reasonable accommodation whenever she/he chooses, even if 
she/he has not disclosed the existence of a disability or requested 
accommodation in the past.  A person does not have to specify a  
particular accommodation at the outset, although it is helpful if she/he can  
suggest one. 

The RAPM or DPS retains administrative responsibility for tracking, 

5. 
recording, and facilitating the processing of the request and notifies an 
appropriate Decision-Maker via memorandum. The RAPM will provide the 
requester with contact information for the designated management official 
and/or program office from whom employees and applicants for 
employment will receive a final written decision. Employees and applicants 
may check the status of their request by contacting the RAPM at 
accommodations@hq.dhs.gov. Employees may also check the status of 
their request in the ATD.   

C. 

Medical Information Requests:  

In response to an employee or applicant request for a reasonable 
accommodation, the RAPM may request medical documentation to ascertain 
13

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

whether the employee or applicant has a disability and whether the employee or 
applicant requires an accommodation.  When a request for reasonable 
accommodation is made, and the nature of the disability or need for 
accommodation is not obvious, and/or the type of accommodation needed is 
unknown or is disputed, the request for supporting information will be made in the 
following manner: 

The RAPM or DPS should email the employee or applicant the

1.
DHS HQ Medical Statement Form (Appendix B) as soon as possible, but
no more than five (5) business days after receipt of a request for a
reasonable accommodation.1  The employee or applicant will provide all
necessary medical documentation (Appendix B) by email, by mail, or in
person to the RAPM or DPS, within ten (10) business days, or the
employee or applicant must notify the RAPM or DPS via email or phone if
she/he needs additional time.  The timeframes for processing will be
suspended until the employee provides all necessary medical
documentation, and will resume when all necessary documents are
received.  The RAPM or DPS may notify the Decision-Maker of the
request so that the Decision-Maker may consider granting an interim
accommodation, where appropriate.

2.
If the RAPM or DPS determines that supplemental medical
information is necessary to support the request, the RAPM or DPS may
work with the OHS MR toward that end.2  The MR may directly contact the
employee’s or applicant’s physician, but only after obtaining a signed
Limited Medical Release Form (Appendix C) from the employee or
applicant.  The agency also has the right to have medical information
reviewed by a medical expert chosen by the agency at the agency’s
expense.

The request for medical documentation must be specific and not

3.
overly broad; it should address only the conditions indicated on the
reasonable accommodation form as requiring accommodation. Medical
documentation can be requested to document:

a. 

b. 

The nature and severity of the impairment(s) at issue; 

The known or expected duration of the impairment(s); 

The major life activity or work-related activities limited by the

c.
impairments;  

1 In certain circumstances, referring and processing of a request will need to be expedited.  For example, 
an applicant may immediately need an accommodation, such as assistance with completing an 
application form, because of an application deadline.

sufficient information to demonstrate that the individual has a disability and 
needs an accommodation, the RAPM or DPS may request the employee 
or applicant to complete and submit a signed Limited Medical Release 
Form (Appendix C) to allow the MR to receive additional required 
information.  

An employee’s or applicant’s failure to provide appropriate medical

documentation to qualify her/him as an individual with a disability may 
result in denial or delay of an accommodation request. 

6. 
All medical information, including information about functional 
limitations and reasonable accommodation needs, obtained in connection 
with a request for reasonable accommodation, will be kept confidential to 
the extent possible.  Documentation is uploaded to the employee or 
applicant’s ATD electronically secured file, and the RAPM or DPS does 
not keep it in hard copy.  In no circumstance will medical information be 
comingled with any official or unofficial employee personnel file. 

Initial Determination as to Whether the Requester is an Individual with a 

D. 
Disability 

Upon receipt of sufficient medical documentation, the RAPM will 

1. 
draft an initial determination as to whether the requester (or the employee 
on whose behalf an accommodation is sought) has shown that she/he is 
an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act.  (See Appendix 
E). 

An OGC, Labor & Employment Law Attorney-Advisor will review

and advise on the RAPM’s draft determination, identifying, at a minimum, 
any concerns regarding the legal sufficiency of the initial determination.

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

draft to address any concerns identified, the RAPM will issue the initial 
determination, via a memorandum (Appendix E), to the Decision-Maker. 

a.
If the RAPM determines that the requester has shown that
she/he is an individual with a disability, the Decision-Maker must
engage in the interactive process as described below, and as set
forth in the RAPM’s memorandum (Appendix E).

If the RAPM determines that the requester has not shown
b.
that she/he is an individual with a disability, the Decision-Maker
does not have any further obligation under this policy with respect
to the reasonable accommodation request at hand.

E.

Decision-Maker Engaging in the Interactive Process:

Communication between the Decision-Maker and the individual requesting an 
accommodation is a priority throughout the accommodation process. 

Upon receipt of the request, via direct request or through the

1.
RAPM’s memorandum (Appendix E), the Decision-Maker should initiate
an interactive process (i.e., engage in a discussion) with the requester as
soon as possible, and, generally, no more than five (5) business days after
the Decision-Maker learns of the request.  This timeframe may be
extended when extenuating circumstances are present, when the
Decision-Maker is awaiting necessary medical information from the
requester, or when the Decision-Maker and/or the requester is in a leave
status.

2.
The individuals involved (i.e. Decision-Maker, requester, RAPM,
DPS,  and/or HR) in the provision of reasonable accommodations must
take a proactive approach in identifying possible accommodations, which
should include consultation with appropriate resources (i.e., OGC, ER,
and CXD) for assistance.

The Decision-Maker and the requester should communicate directly

3.
with each other to make sure that there is a full exchange of relevant
information, being careful not to request information that may have already
been provided to the RAPM.  Before engaging in additional
communications with the requester, the Decision-Maker should familiarize
himself or herself with the information already collected, such as:

How accommodations requested or suggested would

a.
eliminate the barriers experienced; and

Which accommodation(s) (if more than one is available) the

b.
requester believes would be effective.

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

The RAPM or DPS shall provide the Decision-Maker with a dated 
4.  
chronology of all communications with the employee relating to requests 
for medical information for purposes of tracking the timelines set forth in 
this Manual and facilitating the interactive process.   

If, during the interactive process, the Decision-Maker determines 

5.  
that additional information regarding the employee’s limitations or ability to 
perform the job is needed, the Decision-Maker must communicate the 
need to the RAPM or DPS via email  or phone.  On behalf of the Decision-
Maker, the RAPM or DPS will email the employee requesting  appropriate 
information be provided to the RAPM or DPS within ten (10) business 
days.  The RAPM or DPS will notify the Decision-Maker of the fact that  
additional information  has been requested, and once the information is 
received, will email the information, as needed and appropriate,  to the 
Decision-Maker.  

6. 
Appendix G lists resources that may assist the Decision-Maker and 
the requester in identifying possible accommodations. The RAPM or DPS 
is available to assist the Decision-Maker in identifying the potential 
accommodation.  Other subject-matter experts such as HR, CXD, OGC, 
and/or ER may also provide assistance to the Decision-Maker. 

When  the Decision-Maker is considering providing assistive 
7.  
technology software or equipment as an accommodation, she/he should 
contact the RAPM or DPS prior to making such a decision, regardless of  
the funding source for the items to ensure that the chosen items are pre-
approved for use on the program office network. The RAPM  or DPS may 
consult with CXD to determine a product’s approval status or to request 
for assistance in navigating through the OCIO’s approval process for new 
hardware or software being introduced to the DHS network.  

F. 

Examples of Accommodations: 

The following is a non-exhaustive list of the examples of reasonable 
accommodation that may be provided, depending on the particular situation: 

Modified or part-time work schedule:  This may include adjustment  

1.  
of arrival and departure times, providing for specific breaks, and a 
modified or part-time schedule or a (full or part-time) work-at-home 
schedule.  

Assistive Technology (AT) software:  Providing AT and software  

2.  
such as voice recognition software (e.g., Dragon Naturally Speaking), 
screen reading software (e.g., JAWS), and a host of other technologies 
developed to aid persons with disabilities in performing their essential job

functions.3 

Workstation modifications:  Procurement of  items such as  sit-stand 

3.  
desks, ergonomic chairs, or lighting adjustment. 

4.  
Job restructuring:  Reallocation or redistribution of marginal job 
functions that a requester is unable to perform because of disability or 
altering when and/or how a function, essential or marginal, is performed.   
However, the agency is never required to lower production standards, 
whether qualitative or quantitative.  Nor is the agency required to  
reallocate or eliminate  essential functions of a position.   

Personal Assistance Service Provider:   An employee or 

5.  
independent contractor whose primary job functions include provision of 
personal assistance services (e.g., filling out paperwork, note taking, 
typing, retrieving work materials, reading services or sign language 
interpreting).   

Personal Assistance Services:  Services, not otherwise required as 

6.  
reasonable accommodations, that allow employees with targeted  
disabilities to fully participate in the workplace by providing assistance with 
activities of daily living.   

Reassignment:  Reassignment may be granted non-competitively 

7. 
as a last resort after all efforts to accommodate the individual in his/her 
current position have been exhausted.  A reassignment may be made to a 
vacant, funded position within DHS for which the individual is deemed 
qualified.4 

G. 

Expediting Requests: 

In certain circumstances, a request for reasonable accommodation requires 
expedited review and processing.  To the extent possible, requests for expedited 
accommodations will be processed as soon as practicable.  The following are 
common examples of circumstances where an expedited accommodation may 
be needed: 

1. 

To enable an applicant to apply for a job.  Depending on the 

3 The DHS CXD Accessibility Help Desk  is available to provide consultation  on information technology 
(IT) related assistive technologies, including accessibility equipment pursuant to Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  CXD has no need to know any information about the medical condition of the 
person seeking the accommodation and will consult the information about the employee’s functional 
limitations insofar as these limitations affect technology needs in the system of record. 

4 Reassignment as a form of reasonable accommodation is discussed in greater detail below. See 
Management Directive 259-01-002; Procedures for Conducting a Department-Wide Search for a 
Reassignment as a Reasonable Accommodation as Last Resort.

timetable for receiving applications, conducting interviews, taking tests,

To enable an employee to attend a meeting that is scheduled on 

2. 
short notice.  For example, an employee may need a sign language 
interpreter for a meeting scheduled to take place the next day. 

H. 

Providing a Written Decision: 

Decision-makers should generally issue a written decision in an accessible 
format, when requested, either denying or approving and providing a necessary 
accommodation within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of all requested 
information, but no later than thirty (30) business days from the time the request 
was made, absent extenuating circumstances.  The decision should be issued by 
email or in-person with a completed Management Response to Request for 
Reasonable Accommodation decision form (Appendix D), indicating whether one 
or more accommodations will be provided and, if so, what accommodation(s) will 
be provided.  

1. 
Granting a Request for a Specific Accommodation or Provision of 
an Accommodation Where no Specific Accommodation was Requested: 
As soon as the Decision-Maker determines that a reasonable 
accommodation will be provided, the Decision-Maker will communicate the 
decision to the employee in writing and provide a copy to the RAPM or 
DPS. 

The Decision-Maker must take steps to secure any  

a.  
equipment or services that constitute the approved accommodation  
as expeditiously as feasible. 

If the accommodation cannot be provided quickly, the 

b.  
Decision-Maker must inform the employee of the projected  
timeframe for providing the accommodation and the reasons for the 
delay. 

When all the facts and  circumstances known to the Decision-
c. 
Maker make it reasonably likely that an  employee will be entitled to  
a reasonable accommodation, but  the accommodation cannot be  
provided immediately, the Decision-Maker shall provide an interim 
accommodation that allows the employee to perform some or all of 
the essential functions of his or her  job, if it is possible to do so 
without imposing undue hardship to the agency.

Approving an Alternative Accommodation:  The Decision-Maker
may decide to provide an alternative accommodation from the specific
accommodation the employee requested.

a. 
The Decision-Maker may contact the RAPM for advice and
guidance on the scope of potential alternative accommodations. 

When the Decision-Maker finalizes a decision on an

alternative accommodation, the Decision-Maker will communicate
the decision to the employee in

Maker believes the alternative accommodation will be effective.

The written decision on an alternate accommodation must 

c.
inform the employee that she/he has the right  to initiate an EEO
complaint or to initiate a complaint under negotiated grievance 
procedures.

Denial of an Accommodation:  If the Decision-Maker determines

3.
that no accommodation will be provided, the following procedures will
apply:

If the Decision-Maker is considering denying an

a. 
accommodation request, she/he  should contact the RAPM, who will
provide advice and guidance to the Decision-Maker on the reasons
for a denial. 

After receiving the RAPM’s guidance, the Decision-Maker

b.
must provide the employee, with a copy to the RAPM and the DMS
Director, with a written decision by email or in-person along with a
completed Management Response to Request for Reasonable
Accommodation decision form (Appendix D) within generally fifteen
(15) business days of receipt of all the requested information to
make a decision, explaining in plain language the specific reasons
for the denial.

It is advised that a written denial, or correspondence

c.
(Appendix D), be reviewed by the RAPM and by OGC before
transmittal to the employee.

The cost alone, of providing a specific accommodation, will

d.
almost never be an appropriate reason to deny a requested
accommodation, according to the EEOC, because the cost would
need to be shown to impose an “undue hardship” considering the
entire operating budget of DHS.

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

Reasons for the denial of a particular reasonable 

e. 
accommodation request may include the following: 

(1) 

The requested accommodation is ineffective.  

The requested accommodation would cause undue 

(2) 
hardship on the operations of DHS.  

The requested accommodation would require removal 

(3) 
of an essential function of the job.  

The requested accommodation would require 

(4) 
lowering of performance or production standards. 

(5) 

An effective alternative is available.  

(6)  Medical documentation is inadequate to establish that 
the employee or applicant needs such an accommodation.  

The written notice of denial (in an accessible format, when 
f. 
requested) must inform the employee that she/he has the right to 
request a higher-level review by a Senior Management Official, to 
initiate an EEO complaint, or to initiate a complaint under 
negotiated grievance procedures. Written notice of the denial must 
also contain instructions on how to file an EEO complaint and must 
advise the requestor that they must initiate contact with an EEO 
Counselor in the EEO Office via email to HQEEO@hq.dhs.gov 
within 45 days of the denial, regardless of whether the employee or 
applicant participates in an informal dispute resolution process, or 
the complaint may be deemed untimely. 

I. 

Voluntary Informal Dispute Resolution Process: 

Where an accommodation request has been denied, an employee may request a 
higher-level review of that decision from a Senior Management Official in the 
following manner: 

1.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the decision denying a 
request, an employee may contact the RAPM or DPS to request a higher-
level review from the designated Senior Management Official within the 
program office.  The employee may submit to the RAPM additional 
information in support of her/his request. 

The RAPM will convey in writing the employee’s request to the 

2. 
Senior Management Official, who will make a written determination on the 
request within ten (10) business days, and provide it to the individual, the 
Decision-Maker, and the RAPM.  The Senior Management Official may

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

engage the RAPM if the Senior Management Official believes additional 
information is needed to make an informed decision or to re-engage in the 
interactive process.  This may necessitate an extension to the deadline for 
issuance of the written determination. 

If the Decision-Maker’s decision is reversed, and an 

3. 
accommodation granted, the procedures outlined in Section VI.H of this 
document will be followed. 

4. 
If the Decision-Maker’s decision is affirmed, the Senior 
Management Official’s determination must inform the employee that 
she/he has the right to initiate an EEO complaint, or to initiate a complaint 
under negotiated grievance procedures.  A request for a higher-level 
review under Section VI.I does not constitute the filing of an administrative 
complaint or union grievance. 

The Senior Management Official, when appropriate, may consult 

5. 
with the RAPM or DSP, OHS, OGC, or ER before issuing a decision on a 
request for a higher review. 

J. 

Confidentiality: 

All medical information, including information about diagnosis, functional 
limitations, and reasonable accommodation needs obtained in connection with a 
request for reasonable accommodation must be kept confidential and stored in 
accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, and Rehabilitation 
Act requirements.  The following procedures will apply: 

1. 
All medical information must be kept in files separate from 
employee’s Official Personnel File or any unofficial personnel file.  If kept 
in hard copy, it must be kept in a locked file cabinet; 

All employees who obtain or receive medical information as part of 

2. 
the reasonable accommodation process are strictly bound by the 
confidentiality requirements outlined in this document; 

Medical information obtained during the reasonable 

3. 
accommodation process concerning restrictions and functional limitations, 
may be disclosed only to the following individuals on a need-to-know 
basis: 

The Decision-Maker and, if different, an employee’s first-line 

a. 
supervisor; however, the Decision-Maker or supervisor will be 
provided only as much medical information as they need to know to 
engage in the interactive process and to make an informed 
decision, as determined by the Decision-Maker and consistent with 
applicable law;

Other officials with a need to know, including new

supervisors of employees who have received accommodations, in 
order to safeguard against a break in the continuity of providing a 
previously-granted accommodation; 

In certain circumstances, workers’ compensation offices or 

f. 
insurance carriers; and 

As permitted or required by law, including in EEO complaint 

g. 
investigation or in legal proceedings. 

4.  Whenever medical information is disclosed, the individual 
disclosing the information must inform recipients of the confidentiality 
requirements. 

VII.  Reassignment As Accommodation Of Last Resort 

A.  When the Decision-Maker determines that the individual cannot perform 
the essential functions of his or her position with or without a reasonable 
accommodation and/or cannot be accommodated in his/her current position, a 
search for reassignment as an accommodation of last resort is needed.  In such 
cases, the RAPM shall issue a memorandum to the employee indicating that the 
reassignment search process will begin, and will request additional needed and 
relevant information from the employee. 

The memorandum informs the employee that reassignment will be made 

B. 
only to vacant, funded positions with DHS HQ program offices.  A vacant, funded 
position refers to all HQ’s currently vacant positions and those positions that are 
expected to become vacant within 30 business days, whether the positions are 
unannounced, announced, or open until a certification has been issued.  The 
employee must provide a reassignment package to include an updated resume 
and a completed employee questionnaire, identifying among other things, the 
scope of positions for which she/he would qualify, within five (5) business days to 
the RAPM.  

C. 

The reassignment package is submitted to OCHCO who reviews the

DHS HEADQUARTERS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES 

package, classifies the employee’s qualifications, and makes a determination on 
appropriate vacancies at HQ to be considered.  A search for vacant HQ positions 
will be sought out for a maximum of thirty (30) business days.  Vacancies that are 
anticipated to become vacant within the thirty (30) business days will be included 
in the search process. 

The initial job search begins within HQ program offices.  The focus will be 

D. 
on HQ positions that are equivalent to the employee’s current job in terms of 
grade, pay, career level, promotion potential, status, benefits, geographical 
location, type of appointment, and other relevant factors.  As with other transfers 
not required by management, HQ is not required to pay for the employee’s 
relocation costs unless HQ policy provides for such payments for employees 
without disability.  The employee must be able to meet the same security 
requirements of the new position as other eligible candidates for the position.  
Reassignments do not include giving an employee a promotion. Thus, an 
employee must compete for any vacant position that would constitute a 
promotion. 

If an equivalent position is found within a HQ program office for which the 

E. 
employee is qualified, the employee must be offered that position.  She/he 
cannot be required to compete for that position.  All offers of reassignment as the 
reasonable accommodation of last resort should be documented in writing and a 
copy should be placed in the Accommodation Tracking Database. 

F.  When an employee accepts a tentative job offer, OCHCO is no longer 
obligated to conduct further job searches for the employee.  If the employee 
declines the offer, HQ has fulfilled its reasonable accommodation obligation and 
the file will be closed by the RAPM. 

If there is no vacant, funded, equivalent position (or anticipated to become 

G. 
vacant within the thirty (30) business days) within HQ program offices, HQ’s HR 
must document in writing the unavailability of positions within HQ.  The RAPM 
notifies the employee and her/his supervisor.  If such a determination is made, a 
Department-wide search for a vacant position will begin.  OHS, with guidance 
from the CRCL, oversees the DHS-wide search for a reassignment and follow 
the procedures outlined in the Instruction 259-01-002, “Procedures for 
Conducting a Department-Wide Search for a Reassignment as a Reasonable 
Accommodation of Last Resort.”

records and/or other appropriate information pertaining to my medical condition(s) that are 
needed to support and address questions related to my request for reasonable accommodation 
to the Medical Reviewer (MR) of the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters, Office of 
Health Affairs. 

I understand my full responsibility to inform my healthcare provider(s)/professional(s) of the 
need to provide the information requested by the agency.  I acknowledge that this release 
constitutes my permission for my healthcare provider(s)/professional(s) to discuss these matters 
with the Agency’s Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager (RAPM) as necessary in

from me in order to provide adequate information. I understand the RAPM will review the 
information and provide recommendations to my supervisor who will make the final 
determination whether the requested accommodation can be granted or denied.  

I understand that the information the agency is requesting is to be used only to clarify the nature 
of the impairment, the need for reasonable accommodation, how the requested accommodation 
will enable me to perform the essential functions of the job and/or participate in an application 
process or benefit, and, if necessary, determine whether an alternative accommodation would 
be appropriate. 

I understand that this is a confidential limited medical release and disclosure of this information 
will be restricted to agency supervisors and managers on a need-to-know basis; first aid and 
safety personnel, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment;

reasonable accommodation process must be kept confidential and separate from other 
personnel files at all times. 

This Medical Release is valid for one (1) year from the date signed or upon termination of my 
affiliation with the Federal Government, whichever is sooner.  This release is subject to 
revocation by me at any time except to the extent that DHS and the provider have already taken 
action in reliance on it. If this authorization has not been revoked in writing, it will expire with the

FROM: 

SUBJECT:

Office for Civil Rights & Civil Liberties 

Reasonable Accommodation Request 
Employee Name, Title 

This memorandum constitutes our acknowledgment of the request for a reasonable 
accommodation, for Employee Name, Title. 

A request for reasonable accommodation is the first step in an informal, interactive 
process between the individual and the supervisor.  Effective communication between 
the supervisor and employee with support from the Reasonable Accommodation 
Program Manager (RAPM), is vital to identifying and implementing effective 
accommodations.  DHS is required to make reasonable accommodations to a known 
physical or mental limitation of a “qualified individual with a disability.”  This requirement 
may be waived when DHS can show that there is no effective accommodation that 
would not pose an undue hardship on the agency.  29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.2(o) and (p). 

In support of the reasonable accommodation request, this office received supporting 
documentation from Mr./Ms. Employee’s medical provider dated (add date). Mr./Ms. 
Employee’s impairment substantially limits his/her major life activities (list activities 
limited and include qualitative information about limits).  Specifically stated in his/her 
medical documentation, “(Quotation of limitations from medical documentation leaving 
out specific diagnosis).”  The medical document(s) indicates that the impairment affects 
Mr./Ms. Employee’s ability to perform her/his daily essential job functions; “(Quotation 
from medical documentation).” 

Mr./Ms. Employee’s physician indicated that the (1) following alternative 
accommodations would enable Mr. Ms. Employee to perform the essential functions of 
his or her job. Or (2) no other accommodations would enable Mr. or Ms. Employee to 
perform the essential functions of his or her job “(Quotation of accommodations that are 
recommended on medical documentation and how will the accommodations help the 
employee perform the essential functions).”

Appendix E:  Sample Memorandum to Decision-Maker or Employee’s Supervisor from 
Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager 
Mr./Ms. Employee is requesting (list item(s) requested).   

Based on my review of the submitted documentation, the employee has shown that they 
are an “individual with a disability” who has conditions that affect his/her major life 
activities or bodily functions and may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation under 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  

At this time, you as a receiving official must take the following steps to comply with the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended: 

•  Upon receipt of this memo, begin engaging in an interactive process with your

employee regarding her/his request, as well as with the Reasonable
Accommodation Program Manager (RAPM), as needed.  

o  Consider the requested accommodation, as  well as whether there may be

o 

other accommodations that would be equally  effective for her/him.  
I recommend that you go over the accommodations identified in this
memo with the employee to ensure that you understand the requests and 
have a complete and accurate list of what the employee is seeking.  If the 
employee ne  eds any additional accommodations, or if the wording of any
of the items on this list needs to be modified or clarified, those changes
should be confirmed in  the written decision,  with a copy to the RAPM.   
o  The interactive process is ongoing, and therefore updates may need to be 
made to the list over time.  Keeping the list complete and accurate helps
to avoid miscommunication.
If you have additional questions related to the medical information 
provided above regarding the employee’s limitations, job functions they
are unable to perform, or recommended accommodations, please reach
out to the RAPM to assist with acquiring the responses from  the
employee’s medical provider.  

o 

o  While employees are entitled to effective accommodations, they are 

o 

o 

not necessarily entitled to the accommodation of their choice.
It is particularly important for the employee to inform you and the
RAPM if an approved accommodation proves to be ineffective or is
not provided in a timely manner.   Failure to do so may result in the
Agency incorrectly concluding that the employee has been fully
accommodated.
In addition, an accommodation of reassignment is considered an
accommodation of last resort after all other possible accommodations
have been deemed ineffective or pose an undue hardship. 

•  Decide whether to grant the requested reasonable accommodation, propose an 

alternative accommodation, or deny the request.  If you decide to grant a
reasonable accommodation or provide an alternative accommodation, you
should provide your response, in writing via Appendix D:  Management
Response to Request for Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the

Reasonable Accommodation Program Manager 

employee within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of request.  Please provide 
the RAPM with a copy. 

• 

If you decide to deny an accommodation request, you should provide your 
response in writing via Appendix D:  Management Response to Request for 
Reasonable Accommodation (attached) to the employee within fifteen (15) 
business days of receipt of request and provide the RAPM and the DMS Director 
with a copy.  The explanation for the denial of the requested accommodation 
should be written in plain language, clearly stating the specific reasons for the 
denial; for example, why there is no accommodation that would be effective or 
why a specific accommodation would result in undue hardship. 

•  Consult with the RAPM and the Office of the General Counsel, Labor and 
Employment Law (OGC-LEL) group for legal advice regarding reasonable 
accommodations and undue hardship prior to transmitting your denial response 
to the employee. For more information about what constitutes “undue hardship,” 
please consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Enforcement 
Guidance on “Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act,” located at 
http://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html.

Tracking and Recordkeeping 

A. 
The RAPM will track and keep records of all reasonable accommodations 
requested by applicants and employees. The RAPM will maintain these records 
within the ATD for five (5) years or for the employee’s tenure, whichever is 
longer, and will make such records available to EEOC upon EEOC’s request. 
Reports, including but not limited to the annual MD-715 report, will be maintained 
for at least three (3) years.  Executive Order 13164, Establishing Procedures to 
Facilitate the Provisions of Reasonable Accommodations, and EEOC’s policy 
guidance on implementing the Executive Order, state that an agency must be 
able to track the following information: 

The number of reasonable accommodations, by type, that have  

1.  
been requested in the  employment  application process and whether those 
requests have been granted or denied;  

The jobs (occupational series, grade level, and component) for 

2.  
which reasonable accommodations have been requested;  

The types of reasonable accommodations that have been  

3.  
requested for each of those jobs; 

The number of reasonable accommodations, by type, for each job 

4.  
that have been approved; the number of accommodations, by type, that 
relate to the benefits or privileges or employment; and the number of  
accommodations, by type, that have been denied; 

The decision-maker and the reasons for denial of requests  for 

5.  
reasonable accommodation; 

The amount of time taken to process each request for reasonable 

6.  
accommodation;  

The sources of technical assistance that have been consulted in  

7.  
trying to identify possible reasonable accommodations, and;  

Employees and applicants may track the processing of their  

8.  
reasonable accommodation request by  contacting the RAPM at 
accommodations@hq.dhs.gov.  Employees may also check the status of  
their request in the ATD  

B.  
Because of this recordkeeping requirement, supervisors and employees 
must notify the RAPM  when a reasonable accommodation is requested or has 
been provided.

Appendix H:  Personal Assistance Services  

Personal Assistance Services 

Headquarters (HQ) will provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) to employees who 
need them because of a targeted disability during work hours and job-related travel as 
an affirmative action obligation; if the employee requires such assistance in order to fully 
participate in the workplace, including an alternate workspace (e.g., while teleworking), 
or to participate in work-related travel.  

PAS are services that help individuals who, because of a targeted disability, require 
assistance to perform basic activities of daily living such as eating and using the 
restroom.  PAS differ from services that help an individual to perform job-related tasks, 
such as sign language interpreters who enable individuals who are deaf to 
communicate with coworkers, and readers who enable individuals who are blind or have 
learning disabilities to read printed text.  PAS do not include medical services, such as 
administering shots or monitoring blood pressure, and do not have to be provided by 
someone with medical training or qualifications. 

HQ processes PAS requests under the same procedures as a request for reasonable 
accommodation.  Accordingly, the process for requesting PAS, the process for 
determining whether such services are required, and HQ's right to deny such requests 
when the provision of the services would pose an undue hardship, are the same as for 
reasonable accommodations.  PAS will be provided to an individual if: 

•  The individual is a HQ employee;  
•  The individual has a targeted disability; 
•  The individual requires the services because of his/her targeted disability; 
•  The individual will be able to perform the essential functions of the job, without 
posing a direct threat to the safety of themselves or others, once PAS and any 
required reasonable accommodations, have been provided; and 

•  Providing PAS will not impose undue hardship on HQ. 

Not everyone with a targeted disability will be entitled to PAS; only those individuals with 
a targeted disability who request, and require, assistance with activities of daily living 
may receive PAS.  Examples of medical conditions that are more likely to result in the

PAS and any reasonable accommodations; 

•  The requester would create a direct threat to safety on the job, even with PAS 

and any reasonable accommodations; or
