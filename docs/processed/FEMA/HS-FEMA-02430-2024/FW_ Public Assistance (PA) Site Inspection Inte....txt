Subject: Public Assistance (PA) Site Inspection Interim Guidance

Good Afternoon Federal Coordinating Officers:

On October 2, 2023, a memorandum was issued establishing a Site Inspection Task Force to evaluate
current practices and make recommendations to improve upon existing site inspection procedures.
Following review and analysis this task force issued four recommendations:

1.  To use Program Delivery Managers (PDMGs) to conduct Site Inspections, accompanied by the

appropriate training and artifacts.

2.  To conduct Site Inspections in conjunction with the Recovery Scoping Meeting (RSM).
3.  Reimagine the Site Inspector Specialist (STSP) role with the support of Mentor-Practitioners.
4.  Transform Process and Systems to prioritize Customer Service.

Attached to this memorandum is Interim Guidance that describes how PA will implement the first
two recommendations and leverage support from Mentors effective October 1, 2024.

1.  To use PDMGs to conduct Site Inspections, accompanied by the appropriate training and

artifacts.

2.  To conduct Site Inspections in conjunction with the RSM.

The identification and implementation of the task force recommendations to utilize PDMGs to
conduct Site Inspections and conducting Site Inspections in coordination with the RSM is a voluntary
action taken by the Joint Field Office and its leadership. Implementation of these
recommendations will be based on event-specific, Applicant, and damage-driven considerations and
capabilities. Additionally, Field Leadership will be responsible for evaluating the capacity of deployed
staff to implement these recommendations.

I would like to emphasize that in order to facilitate the timely recovery outcomes for Applicants, site
inspections must be conducted as soon as possible after impacts and, to the greatest extent
possible, in-person inspection of these damages should be conducted.
