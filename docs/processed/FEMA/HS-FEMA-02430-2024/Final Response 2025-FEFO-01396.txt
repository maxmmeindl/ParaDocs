Re:  FEMA 2025-FEFO-01396 Final Response 

Dear Max Meindl: 

This is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), dated and 
received on April 22, 2025. You were seeking Reasonable Accommodation (RA) 
approval/denial rates, by age group, for FEMA Region 6, for the past 8 years. 

We queried FEMA’s Region VI (R6) program office and the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) for 
documents responsive to your request. No responsive records were located. OCR’s program 
office researchers provided the following explanation:  

FEMA does not track RAs by age, nor does it have approval/denial rates (which would be 
extremely difficult to calculate). 

You have the right to appeal if you disagree with FEMA’s response. The procedure for 
administrative appeals is outlined in the DHS regulations at 6 C.F.R. §5.8. In the event you wish 
to submit an appeal, we encourage you to both state the reason(s) you believe FEMA’s initial 
determination on your FOIA request was erroneous in your correspondence and include a copy 
of this letter with your appeal. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal within 90 
working days from the date of this letter to fema-foia@fema.dhs.gov, or alternatively, via mail at 
the following address:
