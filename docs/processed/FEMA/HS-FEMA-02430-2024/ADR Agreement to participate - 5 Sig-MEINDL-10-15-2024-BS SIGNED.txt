OFFICE OF EQUAL RIGHTS 
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROGRAM 

AGREEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN ADR

This is an agreement by the parties to submit to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) issues arising out 
of  an  informal  or  formal  complaint  of  discrimination  pending  in  the  Federal  Emergency  Management 
Agency’s Office of Equal Rights.  Both parties understand that traditional ADR is a voluntary process, 
however,  an  employee  participating  in  EEO  ADR  may  terminate  the  process  at  any  time  within  the 
designated 30 calendar day period; however, management or a management designee must participate in 
the process where ADR has been approved. 

Both parties indicate their awareness that ADR proceedings can be confidential in many circumstances 
and confidentiality will be maintained to the greatest extent possible.  Each party agrees, by signing this 
Agreement,  not  to  subpoena  any  Neutral  to  provide  testimony  in  a  subsequent  court  action  that  may 
arise from issues addressed in this complaint or any documents submitted to the Neutral.  In no event, 
will any Neutral voluntarily testify on behalf of  either party or submit any  type of  report to a court in 
connection  with  this  complaint.    It  is  also  understood  that  nothing  said  or  done  during  attempts  to 
resolve  the  complaint  through  ADR  can  be  made  the  subject  of  an  Equal  Employment  Opportunity 
(EEO) complaint.   

The parties agree to make a good faith effort to communicate with each other with the aid of the Neutral 
and to make full disclosure of all relevant information.  Failure to make full disclosure may invalidate 
any subsequent agreement. 

The  parties  understand  that  the  Neutral  is  not  acting  as  an  advocate  or  attorney  for  either  side.    Both 
parties  may  be  represented  by  counsel,  if  desired,  and  may  allow  his/her  counsel  to  review  the 
agreement prior to signing it; however, he/she is not required to do so. 

It is understood that Complainant has the right to withdraw from ADR proceedings at any time during 
the established time frames without loss of rights.  It is agreed that the Neutral and/or the Agency has the 
discretion  to  terminate  the  ADR  proceeding  at  any  time  when  it  is  no  longer  practical  to  continue 
because of the lack of agreement on issue(s) after a reasonable period of time.
