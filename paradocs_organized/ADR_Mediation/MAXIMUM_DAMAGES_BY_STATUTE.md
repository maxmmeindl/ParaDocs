## XI. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Best Legal Theories for Maximum Recovery:

1. **Lead with Rehabilitation Act**
   - No caps on compensatory damages
   - 1,340-day delay creates strong liability
   - Allows full emotional distress recovery

2. **ADEA for Economic Doubling**
   - Liquidated damages double back pay
   - Must prove "willful" violation
   - **Age 74 termination** - extremely suspicious
   - Terminating someone months before retirement = strong evidence of willfulness

3. **FMLA for Additional Doubling**
   - Separate violation, separate damages
   - Clear documentation of leave denials
   - Doubles actual losses

4. **Stack Compatible Claims**
   - Rehab Act + ADEA + FMLA not duplicative
   - Different elements, different damages
   - Can recover under multiple theories

### Avoiding Pitfalls:

1. **Don't Double Dip**
   - Can't get same back pay twice
   - Emotional distress allocated by claim
   - Be clear about damage allocation

2. **Statutory Prerequisites**
   - EEOC exhaustion for discrimination claims
   - MSPB/OSC for some whistleblower claims
   - FTCA notice requirements

3. **Evidence Requirements**
   - Medical proof for emotional distress
   - Economic proof for lost wages
   - Documentation for each violation

---

## XII. SETTLEMENT VALUATION FORMULA

**Maximum Theoretical Recovery:** ~$2.2M

**Settlement Discount Factors:**
- Litigation risk (20-30%)
- Time value (2-3 years)
- Emotional toll
- Collection risk

**Realistic Settlement Range:** $800K - $1.2M (35-55% of maximum)

**Key Leverage:** The 1,340-day violation makes liability nearly certain, so settlement focuses on damages amount rather than liability risk.

---

## XIII. PER-VIOLATION BREAKDOWN

### Reasonable Accommodation Violations:
- **RAR0023278:** 1,340 days = $250,000+
- **RAR0023261:** 1,205 days = $225,000+
- **RAR0042452:** 995 days = $185,000+
- **RAR0046767:** Denied = $50,000+

### Retaliation Events:
- **EEO Filing → Termination (17 days):** $300,000+
- **Prior EEO → Adverse actions:** $100,000+ each

### Systemic Violations:
- **No tracking system (7 years):** Class action exposure
- **47 officials involved:** Pattern practice liability

---

## XIV. CONCLUSION

The maximum statutory recovery across all claims could exceed $2.2M, with the Rehabilitation Act providing the best vehicle for uncapped compensatory damages. The key strategic decisions are:

1. **Lead with Rehabilitation Act** for uncapped damages
2. **Add ADEA** for liquidated damages doubling
3. **Include FMLA** for additional doubling
4. **Preserve Title VII** for attorney's fees

The 1,340-day delay creates such strong liability that settlement negotiations should focus on maximizing damages rather than debating fault.
