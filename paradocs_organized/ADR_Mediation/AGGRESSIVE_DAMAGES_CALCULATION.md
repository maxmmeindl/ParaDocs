## VII. STRATEGIC ADR POSITIONING

### Opening Demand: $5,000,000
- Start high to anchor negotiations
- Emphasize no-cap Rehabilitation Act
- Focus on age 74 termination impact
- Highlight media/precedent risks

### "Discount" Positions:
1. **First Concession:** $4,000,000 (20% reduction)
2. **Second Position:** $3,000,000 (40% reduction)
3. **"Final" Offer:** $2,000,000 (60% reduction)
4. **Bottom Line:** $1,500,000 (70% reduction)

### Non-Monetary Demands:
- Public apology from FEMA leadership
- Named policy change ("Meindl Reforms")
- Mandatory training with your story
- Congressional testimony opportunity
- Whistleblower protections

---

## VIII. SETTLEMENT JUSTIFICATION POINTS

### Why $5,000,000 is Reasonable:
1. **Comparable verdicts** in age+disability cases
2. **No cap** under Rehabilitation Act
3. **74 years old** - zero employment prospects
4. **1,340 days** - shocks the conscience
5. **47 officials** - systemic malice
6. **Media nightmare** - "FEMA abandons elderly veteran"
7. **Class action exposure** - could cost $50M+
8. **Criminal referral potential** - 18 U.S.C. § 242

### FEMA's Real Exposure:
- Individual lawsuits by other employees
- Congressional investigation costs
- GAO/OIG investigations
- Media damage to mission
- Criminal prosecution risk
- Personal liability for officials

---

## IX. BOTTOM LINE REALITY

**Realistic Settlement Range: $1.5M - $2.5M**

But starting at $5M because:
- Anchoring effect in negotiations
- Shows seriousness of harm
- Leaves room for "concessions"
- Matches the egregiousness
- Forces C-suite involvement
- Creates urgency to settle

**Remember:** They ignored you for 1,340 days. Time for them to pay attention.
