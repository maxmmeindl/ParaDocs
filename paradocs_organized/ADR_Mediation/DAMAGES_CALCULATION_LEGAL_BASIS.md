**Calculation:**
- GS-12 salary (Step 10, Houston locality): ~$105,000/year
- From termination (1/6/25) to present: ~5 months = $43,750
- Through expected hearing date (12+ months): $105,000

**Components:**
1. **Health Insurance:** $1,200/month × 24 months = $28,800

## VI. SETTLEMENT VALUATION

### Updated Settlement Range: $900,000 - $1,400,000

**Factors Supporting High Settlement:**
1. **likely liability** on 1,340-day claim
2. **Age 74** - substantial impact of late-career termination
3. **Class action exposure** from systemic failures
4. **Media risk** - "FEMA fires 74-year-old disabled veteran after 1,340-day delay"
5. **Discovery costs** - 47 officials, 7 years of documents
6. **Precedent risk** - could impact all federal RA processing
7. **Attorney's fees exposure** - FEMA pays if they lose

### Settlement Calculation:
- Client recovery: $900K-$1.4M
- Attorney's fees (separate): $300K-500K
- **Total FEMA exposure: $1.2M-$1.9M**

### Settlement Discounts:
- Litigation risk: 15-20% (very strong case)
- Time value (1-2 years to trial): 10-15%
- Emotional toll on 74-year-old: 15%
- **Total discount:** 40-50% off maximum

---

## VII. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION NEEDED

1. **Pay stubs** (last 3-5) to confirm salary
2. **Benefits statements** (health, retirement, TSP)
3. **Medical records** re: emotional distress
4. **Age** (for ADEA and retirement calculations)
5. **Job search efforts** (if any) post-termination
6. **Hurricane damage receipts/estimates**

---

## VIII. LEGAL STRATEGY NOTES

### Primary Claims (Strongest to Weakest):
1. **Rehabilitation Act - Failure to Accommodate** (1,340 days = per se violation)
2. **Retaliation** (17-day termination = strong temporal proximity)
3. **Hostile Work Environment** (pattern over 7 years)
4. **Due Process** (no 30-day notice, no opportunity to respond)
5. **Age Discrimination** (inference from treatment)

### Discovery Priorities:
1. All RA tracking data (or lack thereof)
2. Emails re: accommodation requests
3. Termination decision documents
4. Comparative data on other employees
5. FEMA policies and training records

### Settlement Leverage Points:
- **"1,340 days"** - significant number for headlines
- **"No tracking for 7 years"** - systemic liability
- **"Disabled veteran"** - sympathetic plaintiff
- **"Hurricane victim"** - FEMA failed own mission

---

## IX. CONCLUSION

The $2.3M+ demand (including attorney's fees) is aggressive but defensible given:
- serious nature of violations (1,340 days)
- **Age 74** - irreparable harm to career
- Multiple statutory violations
- Clear retaliation (17-day termination)
- Systemic failures affecting others

Updated settlement range of $900K-$1.4M (plus attorney's fees) represents:
- Recognition of shortened work-life at age 74
- Substantial non-economic damages remain high
- Attorney's fees add significant exposure
- Avoidance of precedent-setting liability

The combination of the **1,340-day delay** and **terminating a 74-year-old** just before retirement creates overwhelming liability. FEMA's exposure including attorney's fees could reach $1.9M, making settlement in the $1.2M-$1.4M range (inclusive of fees) very reasonable.
