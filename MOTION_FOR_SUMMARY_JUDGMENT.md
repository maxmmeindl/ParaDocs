Max J. Meindl III,
    Complainant,

v.                                    EEOC Case No. HS-FEMA-02430-2024

Federal Emergency Management Agency,
    Agency.

## COMPLAINANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Complainant Max J. Meindl III respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment on all claims. No genuine dispute of material fact exists: the Agency ignored Complainant's accommodation request for 1,340 days, then terminated him in retaliation for filing an EEO complaint. These undisputed facts establish liability as a matter of law.

## STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS

1. Complainant has a documented disability requiring reasonable accommodation. (Ex. 1, Medical Records)

2. On September 15, 2020, Complainant submitted a formal request for reasonable accommodation. (Ex. 2, Email Request)

3. The Agency did not respond to this request for 1,340 days. (Ex. 3-28, Unanswered Emails)

4. During this period, Complainant sent 26 follow-up emails that went unanswered. (Ex. 3-28)

5. The Agency never initiated the interactive process. (Ex. 29, ROI at 45)

6. On November 9, 2023, Complainant submitted a new telework accommodation request. (Ex. 30)

7. The Agency denied this request on December 15, 2023. (Ex. 31)

8. Complainant filed a formal EEO complaint on February 20, 2024. (Ex. 32)

9. On March 20, 2024, the Agency raised performance concerns for the first time. (Ex. 33)

10. Complainant had no prior performance issues. (Ex. 34, Performance Reviews)

11. The Agency terminated Complainant on January 6, 2025, while his EEO case was pending. (Ex. 35)

12. Other similarly situated employees received telework accommodations. (Ex. 36, Comparative Evidence)

## ARGUMENT

### I. THE AGENCY VIOLATED THE REHABILITATION ACT BY FAILING TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

The Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would cause undue hardship. 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203. The undisputed facts establish:

**A. Complainant Had a Disability and Requested Accommodation**

Complainant's disability is documented and undisputed. He clearly requested accommodation on September 15, 2020. The Agency cannot dispute receiving this request.

**B. The Agency Failed to Respond for 1,340 Days**

The Agency's 1,340-day silence speaks for itself. This extraordinary delay violates:
- The Rehabilitation Act's accommodation requirement
- The mandate to engage in the interactive process
- The Agency's own 30-day response policy
- Basic principles of good faith and fair dealing

**C. No Undue Hardship Defense Exists**

The Agency never claimed undue hardship during the 1,340-day period. It cannot now manufacture post-hoc justifications. Moreover, the Agency granted similar accommodations to other employees, defeating any hardship claim.

**D. The Violation is Complete and Continuing**

Each day of the 1,340-day delay constituted a separate violation. The Agency's eventual denial without interactive process discussion compounded the violation.

### II. THE AGENCY RETALIATED AGAINST COMPLAINANT FOR PROTECTED EEO ACTIVITY

Retaliation claims require: (1) protected activity; (2) adverse action; and (3) causal connection. All three elements are undisputed.

**A. Protected Activity**

Complainant engaged in protected activity by:
- Requesting reasonable accommodation
- Filing an EEO complaint on February 20, 2024
- Participating in the EEO investigation

**B. Adverse Actions**

The Agency took multiple adverse actions:
- March 20, 2024: Sudden performance concerns
- March 25, 2024: Written warning
- December 2024: Performance Improvement Plan
- January 6, 2025: Termination

**C. Causal Connection**

The temporal proximity is overwhelming:
- Performance concerns arose immediately after EEO filing
- No prior performance issues existed
- Termination occurred during pending EEO case
- The pattern of escalating adverse actions is classic retaliation

### III. NO GENUINE DISPUTES OF MATERIAL FACT EXIST

Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine dispute of material fact exists. The Agency cannot dispute:

1. The dates of accommodation requests
2. The 1,340-day period of silence
3. The lack of interactive process
4. The timing of adverse actions
5. The absence of prior performance issues
6. The termination during EEO proceedings

These facts are documented, admitted, or judicially noticeable. No trial is needed.

### IV. COMPLAINANT IS ENTITLED TO FULL RELIEF

Given liability, Complainant is entitled to:

**A. Compensatory Damages**
- $300,000 for emotional distress (statutory maximum)
- Medical expenses and ongoing treatment costs

**B. Economic Damages**
- Back pay: $245,000
- Front pay: $735,000
- Lost benefits: $367,500

**C. Punitive Damages**
- $300,000 (statutory maximum)
- Warranted by 1,340-day deliberate indifference

**D. Equitable Relief**
- Immediate reinstatement with accommodations
- Expungement of negative personnel actions
- Training and policy changes

**E. Attorney's Fees and Costs**
- $125,402.25 based on reasonable rates and hours

## LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

The undisputed facts establish violations of:

1. **29 U.S.C. § 794** - Rehabilitation Act
2. **42 U.S.C. § 12112** - ADA (as incorporated)
3. **29 C.F.R. § 1614.203** - Reasonable accommodation
4. **29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)** - Interactive process
5. **42 U.S.C. § 12203** - Retaliation
6. **29 C.F.R. § 1614.301** - EEO retaliation

## CONCLUSION

The Agency ignored a disabled employee's accommodation request for 1,340 days, then fired him for complaining about it. These facts are undisputed and establish liability as a matter of law. No reasonable factfinder could conclude otherwise.

The Court should grant summary judgment on all claims and award full relief.

Respectfully submitted,
